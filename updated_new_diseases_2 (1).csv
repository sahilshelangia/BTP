Abutilon,Abutilon Infectious Variegation,"What looks like a normal genetic variegation is due to the Abutilon mosaic bigeminivirus. These phloem-limited viruses are composed of single-stranded DNA and replicate best in young leaves. A single variegated seedling was imported into England from the West Indies in 1868 and vegetatively propagated as an ornamental cultivar. Although transmission occurs through grafting, it is naturally transmitted by a whitefly (Bemisia tabaci) in Brazil. One of the few cases of a desired plant disease.

African Violet ,"(Saintpaulia spp.)-Nematode, Foliar",,,,,
African Violet ,(Saintpaulia spp.)-Ring Spot (Water Spot),"A rapid drop in leaf temperature for a few seconds drastically decreases photosynthetic activity and irreversibly destroys the ultrastructural composition of leaf palisade cells. Generally occurs in the home when African violets are watered from the top with cold water or when cold water splashes onto leaves. This injury, however, can be caused by immersion in 77°F water if the leaf temperature before the immersion was higher than 95°F. Thus, leaf spot is caused by a temperature difference, and does not always require a ""chilling"" temperature. The fate to irreversible injury does not depend on the extent of coldness or chilled period to which leaf was exposed but the temperature gradient at the boundary between the chilled and unchilled area, which seems to be crucial in the formation of leaf spot.
The sensitivity varied among cultivars where Maui and New Jersey were relatively more tolerant to a rapid temperature drop by 15°C (30° to 15°C) than cultivars Ritali and Tamiko.

African Violet ,(Saintpaulia spp.)-Root and Crown Rot,"Pythium ultimum, a fungus-like organism that is a common soilborne pathogen. The disease can be severe in overwatered soils or media with poor drainage. It survives unfavorable periods in soil and infected plant debris. Under favorable conditions, such as cooler soil-media temperatures, spores germinate and infect roots. Crowns and leaves or petioles in contact with the media can also be invaded. Leaf cuttings are also susceptible. After infection, the fungus-like microorganism spreads mainly in the inner tissues of the root and stems. A thick-walled survival structure, oospore, are produced that can persist for several years. Movement of infected plants and/or soil can spread this fungus-like microorganism. African violets are more susceptible when grown in high intensity light for prolonged periods or when infested with root knot nematodes. Most cultivars are susceptible.


","Plants suddenly wilt and die. Sometimes only the lower leaves and petioles become necrotic and dry. Plants are easily separated from the pot and media when the crown has decayed. Roots and root crowns become brown, soft, and mushy.

Armillaria sp. infected trees were found inland in southern Oregon mostly on dead trees and with little on site canopy dieback.


","Infected trees may show canopy dieback and have root systems that are partially decayed. Wind thrown trees have root balls with partially decayed root systems and occur in pockets or areas. Black, shoestring-like structures, called rhizomorphs, occur on large diameter rotted roots. Numerous fruiting bodies arise from the root collar area of a diseased tree or cut stumps. Mushrooms are honey-colored or light tan, with a stalk 4 to 6 inches or more in height and a cap 2 to 4 inches across, often dotted with brown scales.

Alder ,(Alnus spp.)-Canker and Stem Diseases,"There a number of fungi that can infect alder and result in stem decay and/or visible cankers. Few are economically important. Trunk rot is caused by Phellinus igniarius, which is reported to have some economic impact in timber, pulp, and recreation sites in British Columbia. Rough bark is caused by Didymosphaeria oregonensis and is thought to be limited to young trees. Canker growth stops as the bark thickens with age although rough bark remains on the trunks of mature trees. The gluing fungus, Hymenochaete agglutinans, kills the underlying cambium and forms cankers on live branches. Dead branches appear to be cemented to living branches giving the fungus its name. Silver leaf, Chondrostereum purpureum,  is largely a saprophyte but can be a weak parasite. It has been considered as a candidate for use as a biological control agent for red alder stump sprouts. Hypoxylon canker, Entoleuca mammata, also occurs on alder but is more important on poplar and willow. Cytospora canker may also be found on alder on winter-injured tissue.


","Phellinus trunk rot produces a hard, woody hoof-shaped fruiting body generally called a conk. Its presence indicates a lot of decay. Internal decay is soft, yellow-white wood that contains fine black zone lines that run throughout and surround the decay column.
Rough bark forms bands on the stem that range from 1 to 60 cm in length. Around active edges of the lesions, dark perithecia develop. Young trees may be deformed if numerous cankers are present.
The gluing fungus appears as a yellow-margined brown felt on cankers.
Silver leaf decay in wood appears as a reddish-brown stain that disappears as decay advances. In advanced stages the wood is dry, lightweight, and white-mottled to pale yellow in color. Peak production of fruiting bodies was in the spring in BC. Leaves take on a silvery appearance rather than the normal green color.

","Catkin scales enlarge and twist so that they look like reddish, curled tongues. A white, glistening layer of spores may develop on the surface of infected catkins. Leaves of red alder enlarge to several times normal size. They are generally curled, distorted, and turn purple. These leaves will shrivel, dry and fall off the tree. Trees will then have a new flush of leaf growth.

Infected trees are generally located in areas that are subject to flooding and/or high traffic areas with compacted soil. Saturated soils, due to rain or overwatering, favor the disease. Italian alder trees (A. cordata) have been found infected in northwest California. Tanoak (Notholithocarpus densiflorus) and myrtlewood (Umbellularia californica) are also hosts for this organism.


","Cankers generally arise from the root base or near the soil line. Trunks appear to have several small spots or large areas with bleeding lesions. These spots and patches on the bark are dark-brown-to-black, below these are reddish-to-dark-brown stains from oozing fluids. Cracks in the bark may also accompany these bleeding cankers. The vascular cambium below the bark is cinnamon to dark brown. Trees with large cankers may also show canopy dieback, but trees with cankers, even large ones, may have no apparent canopy symptoms. May be confused with Nectria canker. (Similar cankers occur on tanoak and blighted shoots occur on myrtlewood.)

Alder ,(Alnus spp.)-Nectria Canker,"The fungus Neonectria major occurs on both Alnus rubra (red alder) and Alnus incana. In southwest Washington perithecia began to develop through early spring and have been observed to contain mature asci by late spring and early summer. Ascospores release when the perithecia begin to dry following rain or high relative humidity. Spores may gain entry through natural opening such as leaf scars cracks at junctions of twigs and branches, senescence of lower branches, or lenticels. Spores may also infect wounds and injuries caused by winter cold, drought, sunscald, hail damage or insect feeding. Weakened or stressed trees from drought are more susceptible. Stands that receive an average of 10 inches or less of average fall precipitation should be closely monitored for infection. Perithecia have also been found on downed trees, thinning slash, and branches. May be confused with Collar Rot (Phytophthora Canker).


","Cankers begin as small, dark spots on the bark that secrete a dark exudate. During the second year spots enlarge and begin to affect the cambial region with cracks appearing in the bark. Typically the sunken area in the center also cracks, often in the shape of a cat's eye. In severe cases, these cankers resulted in tree death. Dark red perithecia can be found growing near the center of cankers.

Alfalfa ,"(Medicago sativa)-Nematode, Bulb and Stem","Ditylenchus dipsaci is a nematode that lives principally in the stem portions of plants. It can persist in soil without a susceptible crop for at least 2 years. Flooding of affected areas helps to disseminate nematodes and increase damage. Most damage is done by nematode feeding in winter.


","Diseased plants are severely stunted, and stems and leaves show distortion and basal swelling. In warm weather, ""white flags"" develop as leaves become distorted and turn white. Infected stems become brittle and break off easily at the crown.
Severely infected plants die. Blank spaces become evident in the field 2 or 3 years after planting and may be invaded by weeds. Damage is most apparent when growth begins in spring, especially after a warm, wet winter.


","

1) Use resistant cultivars. The cultivars Archer, Lahontan, Washoe, and others are usually resistant to both the stem nematode and bacterial wilt. Relative resistance ratings of varieties are provided by the National Alfalfa and Forage Alliance (alfalfa.org).

2) Rotate with non-leguminous crops for 2 to 4 years, depending on severity of infection. Volunteer plants must be eliminated.

3) Prevent nematode infestations by avoiding use of tail water from old alfalfa fields.

Alfalfa ,(Medicago sativa)-Sclerotinia Crown and Stem Rot,"Sclerotinia trifoliorum or S. sclerotiorum, which are soilborne fungi that can survive indefinitely as sclerotia in soil. They can attack stems and crowns in wet, cool springs. Damage is most severe on stems in solidly planted mature alfalfa fields. Early-growing cultivars such as DuPuits are particularly susceptible. In the Pacific Northwest, sclerotia germinate in spring, producing small (0.25 to 0.5 inch in diameter), light brown, stalked discs (apothecia). Spores are produced and can be carried long distances by wind.


","A cottony, web-like growth develops on stems and crowns in spring. Infected stems wilt, turn brown, become soft and mushy, and totally disintegrate. Rotted crown tissue turns yellow-brown at first, then becomes dark brown and soft. Plants may decompose entirely by late spring, leaving only sclerotia lying on the soil surface. Losses may be attributed to winter injury.

Alfalfa ,(Medicago sativa)-Verticillium Wilt,"Verticillium alfalfae (formerly V. albo-atrum) or V. dahliae, soilborne fungi, may infect numerous plant species without causing foliar symptoms. The disease is in eastern Washington, the Yakima Valley, the Willamette Valley, the Columbia Basin, and irrigated areas in northern, southwestern, and south-central Idaho. Infested seed, infested hay, soil, irrigation water, insects, and contaminated machinery can spread the fungus. Verticillium alfalfae doesn't survive well without a living host though it can persist in dry hay up to 3 years. Verticillium dahliae does produce micro-sclerotia that allow this species to survive many years in the absence of a host. Irrigated fields are the prevalent sites of the disease in the Pacific Northwest.


","Usually only one or a few stems are affected at first. Early symptoms on these stems occur just before physiological maturity. One or more leaflets exhibit a blotchy yellowing followed by desiccation and chlorosis of a V-shape section of the leaflets. Sectoring later spreads to the entire leaflet. Stems remain green and erect as leaves yellow. Later the stem yellows but remains erect with leaves attached. Internally, the stems show a light orange discoloration near the plant crown or even higher as the disease progresses. Usually the root is discolored near the crown, but other crown- or root-invading fungi can also cause similar discoloration.

Apple ,(Malus spp.)-Anthracnose (Bull's-eye Rot),"Cryptosporiopsis curvispora: (sexual: Neofabraea malicorticis) is the most common fungus while N. vagabunda (formerly N. alba) and C. kienholzii have also been found in western Washington. The disease is severe in the high-rainfall apple-growing areas west of the Cascade Range and coastal British Columbia. The fungus causes cankers on twigs and branches and a fruit rot commonly known as ""bull's-eye rot."" Fall rains spread fungal spores from limb cankers to maturing fruit and to young limbs and twigs. Risk of fruit infection that develops post-harvest increases 8 weeks before harvest.
Infection occurs in the fall, but cankers will not appear until spring. Small injuries may facilitate penetration, but the fungus can penetrate uninjured bark. The canker grows actively only 1 year; however, the fungus continues to live 2 or 3 years in the dead canker tissue and produces large numbers of spores. Old infected orchards and nursery stock can be sources of this disease. Other hosts such as crabapples, most pome and stone fruit, Amelanchier, hawthorn, and mountain ash may be sources if close to an orchard. All apple cultivars are susceptible; Spartan, Gala, Melrose, and Akane are highly susceptible.


","Cankers are most abundant on smaller branches but may be on larger limbs or on trunks of young trees. Complete girdling often results if more than one canker is on a limb.
The first apparent sign of an infection is the formation of a small, circular, reddish brown spot on the bark extending to the underlying tissues. Development of these cankers is arrested during winter. The canker expands most rapidly along the branch in spring. The cankers cease to extend and a well-marked crack forms, delimiting the canker from the surrounding healthy tissue. The surface of the canker becomes shrunken and shriveled as surrounding tissue continues to grow during the summer. The dead tissue gradually disintegrates and falls out. All that remains of it may cling to the wound for several years, forming ""fiddle strings"" longitudinally across the face of the canker.
During summer, numerous little pustules (acervuli) appear on the canker's surface, first at the center of the area and later out to its margin. Fungus spores mature in late summer and early fall and are scattered by rain and wind. Cankers 1 year old or more will not enlarge but are a source of fungus spores.
The fruit or bull's-eye rot phase of the disease shows first as brown, depressed, circular spots in storage. As a spot extends, fungus fruiting bodies (acervuli) develop in its center, often in concentric rings, which gives the name ""bull's-eye"" to the rot.


","Aggressive scouting for and removal of cankers is the key to long term control. Whole tree removal is recommended in British Columbia when cankers are found.

1) Establish new plantings with clean stock free of visible cankers.

2) Locate new orchards as far as possible from older orchards that may have existing cankers.

3) Scout new orchards for the disease, because early detection will aid in overall control.

4) Prune out and burn affected twigs and branches, especially on highly susceptible cultivars. This is best done in dry weather  fall rains. On larger limbs and branches, use a sharp knife to remove cankers that are less than half the branch width. Cut out a pointed oval oriented along the axis of the branch.

","Must be combined with canker removal to be effective. Relying on chemical control alone has not been successful in British Columbia.


1) Apply a dormant bordeaux 6-6-100. Spray may be combined with the oil emulsion (3.2% actual oil) recommended for insect control. Bordeaux is not compatible with lime sulfur or polysulfide.

2) Spray at petal fall and 2-weeks preharvest to control bull's-eye rot. Although infection can occur anytime, applications prior to rain, that might occur during the 8-week period prior to harvest, will be most effective.

Apple ,(Malus spp.)-Apple Mosaic,"Apple mosaic disease is caused by Apple mosaic virus. It is often found in mixed infections with several other viruses.There is no indication of field spread other than potentially through root grafting. ApMV, besides many Malus spp. and pear, occurs naturally in more than 30 mostly woody hosts including hazelnut, hop, Prunus spp., Rubus spp., Rosa spp., Betula spp., Chenomeles spp., and Aesculus spp.


","Affected leaves exhibit dramatic white banding patterns on the leaves of many cultivars. Pale yellow to bright cream irregular spots or bands along major veins can be found on leaves in the spring. Symptomatic leaves may drop prematurely. The distribution of symptomatic leaves may be erratic throughout the tree, or limited to a single limb. The number and severity of affected leaves also depends on seasonal temperatures, with the symptoms being more severe in years with moderate springtime temperatures. The disease can result in the loss of up to 40% of the crop depending on the cultivar. Usually symptomless in pear.


","

1) The use of certified virus-tested (and found to be free of all known viruses) planting material is the preferred strategy for protection from this disease.

2) Thermotherapy (24 to 32 days at 38°C) and/or apical meristem culture have been used to eliminate various viruses.

",,
Apple ,(Malus spp.)-Apple Proliferation,"Apple proliferation is caused by Candidatus Phytoplasma mali that can be transmitted by artificial grafting, root grafts or by psyllids and a leafhopper. The disease, which occurs throughout Europe but not in the United States, is a high risk to U.S. production if it ever is introduced here. One possible entry route is illegally smuggled budwood or trees. Infected trees may appear to recover from this disease, such that there are no symptoms, but trees still carry the phytoplasma in the roots. Depending on the pathogen strain(s) found in the tree, it may or may not be present in the above ground portions of these recovered trees. As much as 80% of the fruit from infected trees is unmarketable due to reduced weight, unsatisfactory color, and poor taste.


","The most reliable characteristics include witches' brooms, small fruit, and late growth of terminal buds in the fall. Elongate stipules and leaf rosettes develop on the terminal parts of shoots. Root systems are compact and result in stunted growth of infected trees. All symptoms may not occur on all parts of the tree at the same time.
Flowering may be delayed; flower parts are deformed and may resemble leaves. Leaves emerge earlier and are irregularly serrated and small. Summer leaves often are chlorotic, and trees may exhibit early fall color (lilac or purplish red). Fruits are few, small, incompletely colored, and poorly flavored.


","Send any trees that may have these symptoms to a diagnostic lab for confirmation of the disease, and never smuggle in budwood or trees. Always use certified planting material.

",,
Apple ,(Malus spp.)-Bitter Pit,"Nonparasitic. Bitter pit is a physiological disorder resulting from calcium deficiency in the fruit. It can develop within the first month or two of cold storage as well as on the tree before harvest.
Low levels of calcium in the fruit are due to competition with shoots for calcium, which may be aggravated by weather conditions. Hot, dry weather in July or August tends to increase the incidence of bitter pit. Irregular irrigation may also increase bitter pit. Heavy dormant-season pruning, overthinning, and excessive nitrogen fertilizer promote bitter pit. Injury to trunks, such as winter freezes, interferes with calcium movement. Bitter pit occurs most severely in years of light crops.
Cultivars very susceptible to bitter pit: Honeycrisp, Northern Spy, Gravenstein, Grimes Golden, and Baldwin. A cultivar moderately susceptible is Golden Delicious. Cultivars that are fairly resistant are Delicious, Gala, and Winesap.


","Circular or slightly irregular depressed spots appear on fruit surface, beneath which are brownish or streaked necrotic areas. Pitting (discrete necrotic spots) may not always be visible from the outside of the fruit. Necrotic tissue is usually soft until it dries out. Pits are more numerous on blossom end of the fruit. These may appear on the tree or in storage after harvest.
May be confused with stink bug feeding damage, which is a depressed blemish with a puncture site is always visible in the center leading to a brown cork-like area in the flesh.


","

1) Prune lightly by thinning out branches rather than by heading.

2) Head new shoot growth in summer on an overly vigorous tree. This may be done up until a month before harvest.

3) Apply five (5) summer sprays about 1 month apart of calcium chloride or calcium nitrate at not more than 5 lb/100 gal. Add a surfactant to all sprays to reduce the possibility of burning. Higher rates will burn foliage and sometimes fruit. Sometimes calcium nitrate interferes with fruit color formation. Do not apply in hot weather. Spray must cover the fruits.

4) Where possible, use overtree sprinklers to cool trees in unusually hot weather.

5) Bring soil pH into optimal range of 6 to 6.5 and avoid excess nitrogen. Reduce potassium fertility by 25 to 30% for 'Honeycrisp'.

6) Use chemical thinning to avoid alternate-year bearing.

7) Avoid damaging trunks.

8) Maintain a constant soil moisture supply.

9) To avoid the condition in stored fruit, rapidly cool fruit after harvest then store at low temperatures, high humidity and under controlled atmosphere.

10) Although drenching fruit with a calcium solution after harvest can help increase calcium in the fruit, field sprays are more effective in preventing bitter pit.

Apple ,(Malus spp.)-Bull's-eye Rot,,,,,
Apple ,(Malus spp.)-Burrknot,"Genetic. The knot is a highly branched but dwarfed root system above the soil line. Although it is often mistaken for crown gall, it is composed of differentiated root tissue that starts from root initials in the young tree. Low light and high humidity and temperature can work together to stimulate development of the root initial. Trunk protectors that reduce light can increase the occurrence of burrknot. Burrknot is common on many of the popular rootstocks such as M7, M9, M26, MM106, and MM111.


","A rough, warty growth occurs above the soil line on dwarfing rootstocks. The growth generally is circular or spherical. Bumps are root initials (the beginnings of new roots). Knots can increase in size during the growing season. Small, normal-looking roots may be present if the burrknot is partially buried.
Trees with severe burrknot can be stunted or girdled or break off in high winds. Adjacent burrknots can increase in size faster than the normal trunk and can girdle the tree. A heavy crop load also can cause the tree to break at the knot. Burrknot has also been observed on the branches of susceptible cultivars in western Washington and Oregon.


","

1) Avoid using rootstocks genetically disposed to this problem.

2) Mound soil around the base of the tree to encourage the burrknots to root.

3) Plant trees with the graft union 1 to 2 inches above the soil line. However, the risk of scion rooting increases with these soil-related control measures.

4) Remove or kill the tissue with a knife or blowtorch. However, this generally is not an economical alternative.

","


1) Gallex (ready to use) painted on very young knots to reduce further development. Knots may return the next year or, if treated late, may continue to develop. Tissue around the knot may be injured, especially on younger plants. Prepare the surface by removing soil from around the galled area, and allow the area to dry before application. Not registered in Idaho. 24-hr reentry.

Apple ,(Malus spp.)-Crown and Collar Rot,"Phytophthora cactorum and other species, a soilborne fungus-like microorganism. Crown rot is a disease of the rootstock portion (or root crown area) of the tree; collar rot is a disease of the scion portion. Both are serious diseases of apple and other orchard trees in British Columbia, Washington, and Idaho, and have become a problem in Oregon orchards with clonal rootstocks, principally Malling Merton (MM) 106. Crabapple can also be infected. Pear scions are more susceptible than apple but popular pear rootstocks are much more resistant.
The fungus survives primarily as oospores in soil, organic debris, or infected tissues. Oospores produce a swimming spore stage (zoospores) when soils are at or near saturation. Zoospores swim to and infect roots. Movement within roots to the root crown is greatest between pink bud and shoot elongation. Saturated soils due to high rainfall, excessive irrigation, and/or poorly drained soils favor infection and disease development.
The fungus Athelia rolfsii (formerly) Sclerotium rolfsii has been isolated from trees with collar rot symptoms in eastern Washington. Overwatering was among the various issues in these orchards.


","In early fall, an affected tree shows bronzing, purpling, or yellowing foliage of one or more limbs, accompanied by bark reddening. There is a reduction in the size of leaves and terminal growth. Examination at the root crown or collar after scraping away the soil reveals dead bark. The cambium will be orange-brown to red-brown, eventually becoming dark brown instead of white. A distinct margin may separate healthy from infected tissues. In many cases, the tree may be completely girdled before its condition is noticed. Fire blight symptoms may be similar when confined to the rootstock.
Moderately resistant: MM111, M2, M7, M26, 'Golden Delicious', 'Delicious', and 'Rome Beauty'. Susceptible: MM104 and MM106.


","Water management that minimizes excessive water around the root crown is critical for management of this disease.

1) Locate orchards on well-drained slopes if possible.

2) Tile orchards or sites with poor drainage.

3) Plant on a raised bed to help keep water away from trunks.

4) Use resistant rootstocks. 'Antonovka', 'McIntosh', and 'Wealthy' apple seedlings, and M9 clonal rootstocks, as well as B9 and advanced selections in the Geneva series have shown high resistance to collar rot.

5) Avoid the application of too much irrigation water.

6) Do not let irrigation water repeatedly hit trunks.

7) During summer, examine root crowns of trees for collar rot and scrape off diseased tissues. Leave root crowns exposed to the air until late fall.

8) Avoid wounding root crowns. If a wound is made, keep it uncovered and open to the air for the rest of the season.

","Apply before Phytophthora symptoms appear, especially in orchards favorable for disease development. No chemical will revitalize trees showing moderate to severe crown rot symptoms. Although resistance has not been reported, alternate materials so resistant fungi do not develop quickly.

Apple ,(Malus spp.)-Diplodia Canker,"Several Diplodia spp. can cause branch cankers on apple but Diplodia seriata (sexual Botryosphaeria obtusa), the cause of black rot of apple, has been found most often, especially from eastern Washington.  Both D. seriata and D. mutila have been found in the Okanagan Valley of British Columbia. Cankers usually develop around cold-injured tissue, mechanical wounds, or fire blight infections. This fungus also causes leaf spots and fruit rots. Black rot of apple has been found in eastern Washington apple orchards. The fungus survives from season to season in cankers or mummified fruit. Warm and wet weather favors spore dispersal, infection, and disease development. Cultivars 'Delicious' and 'Pristine' are susceptible while 'Golden Delicious', 'Braeburn', and 'Fuji' are relatively resistant. Black rot, however, was observed on 'Fuji', 'Aurora', and 'Golden Gala', apples in Washington but less so on 'Pink Lady'.


","The bark of infected limbs becomes slightly sunken with reddish-brown areas. The canker may just be a superficial roughening of the bark or develop into necrotic cracks with discolored vascular cambium. Cankers can become a few feet long.
Leaf symptoms include the development of a leaf spot with a purple margin and tan center commonly referred to as frogeye leafspot. Infected leaves fall prematurely from the tree. A blossom end fruit rot may also develop starting as a purple spot with a red ring. Lesions may also occur at insect injuries. The fruit lesions in Washington did not develop concentric rings but were light-to-dark-brown with defined margins. Pycnidia may develop in the lesions. In advanced stage the fruit was completely rotted, spongy to firm, and light brown. Fruit mummify and remain attached to the tree.

Apple ,(Malus spp.)-Fire Blight,,"Several combinations of rootstock (M9 and M26) and cultivar (Braeburn, Fuji, and Gala) are very susceptible to fire blight. Trees may collapse without any sign of disease in the canopy. Disease symptoms can be confused with Phytophthora collar rot. Symptoms have been observed around the graft union area. Infection may spread from the collar to the roots or from the roots to the collar. Cankers near the base of the trunk often appear dark, water-soaked, and purplish on the outside. The margin may at first be indefinite or raised and blistered but becomes definite and marked by a crack or crevice later. When the bark is removed, the cankered area may show red-brown streaking.

Apple ,(Malus spp.)-Flat Apple Disease,"Apple flat apple disease is caused by Cherry rasp leaf virus (CRLV). This virus is transmitted by dagger nematodes, Xiphinema americanum. The virus is believed to have originated in native vegetation and can move between cherry and apple plantings. Apple trees planted on sites that previously contained CRLV-infected cherry trees will become infected. Many weed species that inhabit the orchard floor are hosts to the virus. They are reservoirs of infection but do not exhibit any obvious symptoms. Since the virus is nematode transmitted, it spreads slowly in the orchard.
The virus has been found in eastern Washington and Hood River Oregon.


","Flat apple symptoms are most severe on 'Red Delicious' and related cultivars. The length of the fruit is significantly reduced and the stem cavity becomes very shallow. At first, only a few fruit will become symptomatic on lower limbs, but eventually, the entire tree will be involved.


","

1) The use of virus-tested (and found to be free of all known viruses) planting material is important for control.

2) Avoid future orchard sites that test positive for the presence of the nematode.

","Fumigation between replanting may only delay disease development.

Apple ,"(Malus spp.)-Fruit Rot, Phytophthora","Phytophthora cactorum, a soilborne fungus-like microorganism frequently carried in irrigation water. Fruit rot has caused significant loss of fruit where irrigation water wetted fruit, usually on lower branches or from overhead irrigation for summer fruit cooling. As little as 1 hour of fruit wetting is needed for infection. Apple susceptibility increases 10 days before harvest. Can be a problem not only on pome fruit but also stone fruit such as peach.


","Firm, tan-colored, rotted spots on areas up to more than 1 inch in diameter on the fruit. Older infections can cause the whole fruit to rot on the tree.

Apple ,(Malus spp.)-Fruit Russeting,"There are many reasons for fruit to russet including cool, wet weather, frost, pesticides, viruses, fungi, and bacteria. Golden apples are more susceptible to russeting than red apples. Each cultivar is affected differently by the above factors. The d'Anjou pear is also susceptible to fruit russeting. Russet results from the damage to epidermal cells that occurs within the first 30 to 40 days after petal fall. Once damaged, a brown layer of suberized cells form in the lower epidermal region. As cork cells develop in this area, they push outward and become exposed to the surface as the fruit matures.
Cool (not necessarily freezing) weather and wet fruit, especially from pink-blossom stage until 3 weeks after petal fall can cause russeting. 'Golden Delicious' is most susceptible to russeting. This kind of weather may be the cause or may only encourage growth of the fungi and bacteria discussed below.
Many spray materials (including surfactants), especially emulsifiable concentrates and materials containing copper, zinc, or calcium, if not evenly distributed by spray equipment can produce a russet on apples.
Several fungi can also russet fruit including Podosphaera leucotricha, which causes powdery mildew. Cultivars susceptible to powdery mildew, such as Jonathan and McIntosh, can develop this type of russeting. Aureobasidium pullulans and Rhodotorula glutinis are fungi common on the surface of apple fruit and leaves and have been associated with fruit russeting. Some biological control products contain these fungi and can increase fruit russet under certain conditions. Fruit are susceptible to this kind of russet during bloom and at least 4 weeks after petal fall. A study in Hood River found that these later 2 fungi were not major factors contributing to russet of d'Anjou pear fruit.
Several different kinds of bacteria including Erwinia herbicola and Pseudomonas sp. that produce high levels of the plant hormone indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) cause russeting. These bacteria have been shown to increase russeting when inoculated onto pear fruit.
Fuji apples have a newly described but unknown cause of russeting, which has been called flecking. Severity increases during alternate years.


","Russeting caused by cool weather and wet fruit often is associated with corky lenticels and tan markings shaped like rain-splashed water droplets. These markings are more abundant at the stem end.
A band or ring that forms either partially or completely around the fruit is usually what characterizes frost russeting. Russeting from spray materials is likely to be found where spray droplets accumulate, such as the lowest portions of the fruit. Russeting from powdery mildew is tan to gray and has a netted appearance.


","

1) Grow cultivars less susceptible to russeting. The late-maturing 'Golden Delicious' strains, 'Criterion', and 'Hawaii' normally do not russet in the Willamette Valley. 'Smoothee' (a 'Golden Delicious' strain) and most of the red apples have little russeting.

2) Control powdery mildew.

3) Check for uneven spray distribution or worn nozzles.

Apple ,(Malus spp.)-Green Crinkle Disease,"This disease is caused by a unknown, graft-transmissible agent. All trees exhibiting this serious disease are infected with Apple stem grooving virus, Apple stem pitting virus, and/or Apple chlorotic leaf spot virus. It is not known if the disease is elicited by a combination of one or more of these viruses, a particular isolate of one of these viruses, or a separate, unidentified pathogen. The disease appears not to spread in the orchard. If it does spread, it does so very slowly, and possibly by root grafting.


","On sensitive cultivars, the fruit will develop deep depressions and distortions that increase in severity as the fruit matures. Cracks may develop in the pits and crevices. Severe fruit symptoms may appear on one or two limbs of an infected tree. There are no leaf symptoms associated with this disease. Symptoms resemble Rosy Apple Aphid injury but can be distinguished from insect injury by the appearance of discolored vascular tissue extending from beneath the pits to the vascular bundles of the fruit. These strands are not associated with insect injury.


","

1) Use only virus-tested (and found to be free of all known viruses) planting and propagation material.

2) Remove and destroy infected trees.

",,
Apple ,(Malus spp.)-Latent Virus Diseases,"Three viruses generally considered as ""latent"" in apple are Apple stem grooving virus (ASGV), Apple stem pitting virus (ASPV), and Apple chlorotic leaf spot virus (ACLSV) all of which are not too important in commercial apple production. ASGV causes Apple Decline on Virginia crabapple, ASPV causes Apply Spy 227 epinasty and Spy decline while ACLSV causes Apple chlorotic leafspot on many crabapple cultivars (also called Apple top-working disease in Japan). Latent just means these viruses do not cause symptoms on most commercial cultivars, although specific strains of one of these viruses or a combination of them may be associated with diseases such as apple green crinkle disease and apple dead spur. These viruses do not have a natural vector but are graft transmissible. A survey of several important fruit tree nurse-ries in the Willamette Valley of Oregon in 2014 did not detect these 3 latent viruses.


","Rootstocks of M. sylvestris 'Virginia Crab' respond to Apple stem grooving virus by developing a brown necrotic line at the graft union where complete breakage often occurs. Apple stem pitting virus also causes significant pitting and weakening of 'Virginia Crab' rootstocks.
Apple top-working disease in Japan was the result of a hypersensitive reaction of rootstocks (M. prunifolia var. Ringo) to Apple chlorotic leafspot virus in apple scions. The hypersensitive reaction at the graft union resulted in weakened trees with reduced production, and the weak graft unions were very susceptible to wind damage.
Some of the new cold-tolerant and fireblight-resistant rootstocks are hypersensitive to one or more of the latent viruses.


","Use only virus-certified propagation material and rootstocks.

",,
Apple ,(Malus spp.)-Moldy Core and Core Rots,"Several different fungi can colonize the open sinus of certain apples such as 'Delicious', 'Golden Delicious', 'Gravenstein', and 'Idared'. These cultivars have an open sinus that extends from the calyx (flower) end into the core. Alternaria alternata and A. tenuissima colonize the floral tissue during flowering and cause a dry core rot. Mild temperatures and wet weather during bloom (as is typical of west-side locations) are favorable for disease development. Many other fungi have been associated with these same conditions. Penicillium spp. and other fungi can cause a wet core rot in the same location.  They may get into the core naturally or when apples are placed in a dunk tank after harvest.


","Growth of fungal mycelium within the locules but not the mesoderm of the fruit is characteristic of moldy core. Dry core is defined as a slow dry and corky rot that affects the tissue around the core. Wet core rot generally develops more in storage but is an aggressive wet rot that may cause partial or complete fruit rot. External symptoms are generally rare and in some cases can be confused with codling moth damage.


","

1) Fungicides used for scab and powdery mildew during bloom generally keep these diseases in check.

2) Harvest fruit at the correct stage of maturity.

3) Do not submerge susceptible cultivars in a dump tank prior to storage.

",,
Apple ,(Malus spp.)-Necrotic Leaf Blotch (Golden Leaf Drop),"A physiological problem that occurs when a cool, rainy period of 4 to 5 days precedes several hot, sunny days. A hormonal imbalance may be the reason. The disorder is restricted to 'Golden Delicious' and its sports.


","Irregular necrotic blotches occur on mature leaves within 12 to 24 hours. The shape of the necrotic area is restricted by larger veins, which are not affected. Blotches may vary in number from one to six or more per leaf. Affected leaves generally turn yellow and drop within 4 to 7 days of symptom development. Leaf symptoms and defoliation occur in two to four waves during the growing season. Young, vigorously growing trees are less affected than older, slower growing trees.


","

1) Incidence of this problem is less when grown on M9 or M26 rootstocks.

2) Zinc oxide applied in 3 to 4 cover sprays can reduce symptoms.

3) Two foliar applications of manganese can reduce symptoms.

","Although this is not a fungal problem, some symptom relief has been obtained by using EBDC fungicides such as mancozeb during cover sprays. In most years, control is not needed.


",
Apple ,(Malus spp.)-Necrotic Leaf Spot,"Isolation attempts typically find different saprophytic fungi associated with the necrotic tissue. Fewer necrotic spot symptoms have been associated with some fungicides, indicating a fungal cause to the problem. Alternaria alternata, Stemphyllium, and Aureobasidium have been among the fungi recovered in western Oregon.  Additional observations have detected Venturia inaequalis conidia in the center of several spots. It has been suggested that the spots are ""burned out"" scab lesions that other fungi have since colonized and expanded. Burned out meaning that the scab fungus has colonized the tissue but then subsequently killed due to fungicide use. Other theories include a hypersensitive reaction to rust infection again followed by colonization by saprophytic fungi. The ability of A. alternata to incite these lesions has also been suggested. This problem is different from Golden Delicious necrotic leaf blotch. This problem has been observed in western Oregon and Hood River production areas. The Rome cultivar seems to develop these unusual spots in many areas of the United States. In western Oregon, it is seen on cultivars Rome and Golden Delicious apples rather than cultivars Braeburn, Jonathan, or Red Delicious. Severe some years and almost nonexistent other years but generally of minor concern.


","Discrete necrotic round spots develop on leaves in late spring and early summer. Spots are typically a half-inch in size, light brown with a thin dark purple border. Spots are seen on both sides of the leave in the same location (in contrast to apple scab which is seen on only one side or the other). Smaller spots may be more purple than brown. Larger spots may have broader purple borders and seem less circular. Symptoms are similar to both frogeye leaf spot as well as Alternaria blotch.


",,,
Apple ,(Malus spp.)-Nectria Canker (European Canker),"Neonectria ditissima (formerly Nectria galligena), a fungus. The disease is found primarily in high-rainfall areas along the coast and Willamette Valley and rarely in southern, central, or eastern Oregon. The canker is perennial. White fungal structures (sporodochia) appear on the canker either the first spring after infection or the next fall and winter. Round, red fungus bodies (perithecia) discharge another type of spore during the second winter and spring. Infection occurs during fall rains primarily through leaf scars but can also get in through wounds, pruning cuts, or where a young twig or branch has broken off. It has been suggested that the disease is a problem in locations where it rains more than 30% of the days of the month and there are at least 8 hours of temperatures between 52°F to 60°F.
The cultivars Braeburn, Gala, Gravenstein, King, Macoun, McIntosh, Red Delicious, and Spartan are very susceptible. The cultivars Golden Delicious, Honeycrisp, Jonagold, Jonathan, Northern Spy and Rome Beauty are less susceptible. Pear is susceptible but only when conditions are very favorable for disease development.


","Elliptical, sunken areas that are dark reddish-brown occur on year-old twigs around leaf scars. If or when girdled, the areas beyond the infection wilt and die. On older wood, infections look similar the first year but a callus forms around the infected area. The next year, the fungus invades and kills the new callus of the previous year. The result is a series of concentric calluses, one of which grows in the healthy tissue at the extreme margin of the canker each year. Cankers have a zonate appearance. The outer ring of the canker is irregular and roughened by cracks in the bark. Cankers can also be associated with various wounds such as from pruning.
This fungus can also infect fruit, causing the disease known as eye rot on the calyx end and bull's-eye rot at the lenticels similar to anthracnose and perennial canker.


","

1) Cut out and destroy cankers during dry weather.

2) Disinfect pruning shears during wet weather.

Apple ,(Malus spp.)-Nectria Twig Blight (Coral Spot),"The fungus Nectria cinnabarina is considered a wound invader since it is frequently associated with pruning cuts. Naturally occurring scars may also be sites of entry for the spores. Broken fruit pedicels left in the tree during harvest are another site of entry. The fungus has a wide host range.


","Small, sunken cankers appear near wounds and develop slowly. After two or more seasons, small branches or twigs are girdled. Leaves beyond the canker generally wilt and die. Bright pink to coral-red fruiting bodies (sporodochia) break through the bark in the cankered area. Another fruiting body (perithecia) also will form in the same area. Both fruiting bodies are borne on a stroma.

Apple ,"(Malus spp.)-Nematode, Dagger","The dagger nematode (Xiphinema spp.) transmits the Tomato ringspot virus to apples causing Union Necrosis and Decline. These nematodes also transmit Cherry rasp leaf virus causing the Flat Apple disease. Both the nematode and virus are required for either disease to occur. Damage caused by the virus affects fruit production. The nematode is an ectoparasite found only in soil. Nematode populations are highest in fall, at the end of the growing season.


","No known symptoms occur from nematode feeding alone. Union necrosis results a dark necrotic line that forms at the graft union flanked by spongy orange tissue. Fruits on Flat-Apple-infected trees are smaller, flatter, and the calyx end tends to be open.


","Practice good weed management as many weeds are reservoirs of virus.

1) Preplant soil fumigation in fall is highly recommended; however, spring fumigation is effective provided criteria for fumigation conditions are met. Generally, soil temperatures and moisture for fumigation is better in fall than in spring. In addition, nematode populations are more active in fall and, therefore, more susceptible. Also, cool, wet conditions in spring slow the fumigant's diffusion rate, thus delaying planting.

Apple ,(Malus spp.)-Perennial Canker (Bull's-eye Rot),"Cryptosporiopsis perennans (sexual: Neofabraea perennans), a fungus. The fungus is closely related to that causing anthracnose, and the diseases are somewhat similar. The fungus overwinters in cankers and infected fruit. Conidia are exuded from acervuli and dispersed by rain. Perennial canker; however, is associated with the presence of woolly apple aphids, low temperature or southwest injury, and pruning wounds. The fungus can infect through the wounded portions of the tree. Wooly apple aphids cause wounds each year on the edge of the canker allowing the fungus to reinfect that area. Fruit infection increases 2 weeks before harvest. Other hosts include crabapples, most pome and stone fruit, Amelanchier, hawthorn, and mountain ash.


","On wood-cankers made up of overlapping concentric rings of woody tissue encircling the center wound are characteristic of the disease. Apple anthracnose does not have the concentric rings of woody tissue in the canker. Each ring indicates the disease's progress for 1 year. As the canker enlarges from year to year, it cuts off more of the sap-conducting tissue, reducing the growth and bearing capacity of the tree. Sometimes scaffold limbs are girdled and a large part of the tree killed.
On fruit-the symptoms of the fruit rot, ""bull's-eye,"" phase of the disease are identical to that caused by anthracnose. ""Bull's-eye rot"" occurs at open lenticels or at breaks in the skin. The rot spots may be only specks, but most of them are 0.5 to 1 inch across by the time the fruit reaches market. Spots may occur singly or be numerous. They may be pale yellowish cream or uniformly brown but are most often brown with a pale center that forms a bull's-eye. Spots are flat to sunken, and rotted tissues are relatively firm. The skin over the surface does not break easily under slight pressure. Rot may be shallow or nearly as deep as wide. In the deeper rots the penetration is more or less U-shaped. Usually, decayed tissues are somewhat mealy and do not separate readily from healthy tissues. Spore-bearing tufts on the causal fungus may or may not be present on the surface of the rot but when present are short, wet, cream colored, and protrude through the skin.


","

1) Prune out cankers when practical.

2) Harvest apples at the proper stage of maturity.

3) Keep fruit dry after picking and remove from orchard as soon as possible.

4) Avoid wounding trees. If wounds occur, induce rapid healing.

5) Prevent sunscald or southwest injury using white wash of trunks or shields.

Apple ,(Malus spp.)-Powdery Mildew,"Podosphaera leucotricha, a fungus that overwinters in terminal buds of apples. Temperatures less than 11°F will begin to kill fungal mycelia in these buds. Infected buds start to die at -11°F; however, healthy buds can survive even lower temperatures. Infected buds that survive winter open later than healthy buds. When infected shoots begin to grow they may already be covered with conidia that are dispersed to healthy foliage. Young growth becomes infected, develops new colonies and new conidia that continue this cycle many times during the growing season. Conidia are generally inhibited by free water on leaf surfaces. Leaves are susceptible for only a few days after emerging. New terminal growth on apple trees is particularly susceptible. Fruit infection occurs during bloom stages. Pear orchards are at a higher risk of disease development if planted next to apple orchards. Other hosts include crabapple and quince.
Powdery mildew is a frequent problem throughout the Pacific Northwest. Losses are due to its chronic effect on tree vigor and yield in addition to poor fruit finish for highly susceptible cultivars. Very susceptible apple cultivars include Braeburn, Granny Smith, Gravenstein, Honeycrisp, Jonathan, Newtown, and Rome. Fruits of the cultivars Jonathan and Rome also may be severely affected. Less susceptible apple cultivars: Fuji, Golden Delicious, Red Delicious, and Delicious strains.


","The disease occurs on foliage, twigs, blossoms, and fruit. Small gray or white felt-like patches of fungus develop, frequently on the undersides of leaves. Young infected leaves increase in length but not in width, and become curled and distorted. Infected foliage is brittle and may be killed or cease to function normally, thus weakening the tree. The fungus often covers entire terminal shoots with its masses of white mycelium and powdery spores. Severely diseased terminal shoots are stunted with shortened internodes and are easily seen throughout the growing season and may persist into the dormant season. Diseased blossoms are brownish and shriveled and soon die. When fruits are infected, a network of lines, generally referred to as russeting, develops on the skin in the diseased area.


","

1) Plant resistant cultivars such as Enterprise or Pristine, which have both powdery mildew and scab resistance. 'Fuji', 'Golden Delicious', 'Red Delicious', and 'Delicious' strains are not as susceptible as others cultivars.

2) Remove infected terminal shoots during dormant season pruning when noticed and if practical.

3) Removal of the upper two-thirds of every shoot was shown to reduce disease. (Not practical for tip-bearing apples.)

4) Backyard growers may find it useful to prune out and destroy infected shoots as they appear early in the year, but that is ineffective when the disease is severe.

5) Follow cultural practices that promote good air circulation, such as pruning, and moderate shoot growth through judicious nitrogen management.

","Apply fungicides at prepink, pink, calyx, and first cover. To limit infection of next year's buds, continue applications until terminal growth ceases.

Apple ,(Malus spp.)-Replant Disease,"A complex of fungi, oomycetes, and nematodes are the biological factors contributing to apple replant disease. In addition, nonbiological factors including poor soil structure, moisture stress, low or high pH, insufficient available phosphorus, and cold stress while not primary causes of the disease, may exacerbate overall symptom development. Although causal factors are sometimes reported as varying in any one geographical area a measure of consensus, relative to the disease cause, has been arrived at in studies conducted in Washington, New York, Maine, the Netherlands and South Africa. This is a serious, common cause of poor growth of apple trees established on sites previously planted to apple or pear orchards or nurseries. Tree growth is suppressed the first year and for the life of the orchard and on occasion of severe disease pressure tree death may occur. Compared to healthy trees, yields can be reduced by 20% to 50% and fruit quality is also lowered.
Soil analysis is recommended to detect nutrient deficiencies and to determine whether lime is required to adjust pH. There is no effective treatment of replant disease once trees are planted.
Mixing monoammonium phosphate fertilizer (11-55-0 or 11-51-0) with the planting hole soil at a rate of 1 g/liter of soil is no longer recommended since the high salt concentration can burn roots. Although there is an initial growth increase, the practice has no overall benefit after 5 years.


","Apple replant disease has no definite symptoms other than trees' poor growth the first few years after transplanting. Vigorous young trees planted in a problem site stop growing in early summer. Affected trees leaf out each spring but produce little or no shoot growth. Leaves are often smaller and lighter green than leaves on vigorous trees. Few new lateral or feeder roots are produced, and existing roots become discolored and deteriorate.


","

1) Avoid by not planting apples or pears on the same ground where an apple or pear orchard or nursery has recently been removed. Rotations out of pome fruit for 5 to 8 years are advised.

2) Adjust soil pH if too high or low.

3) If planting on old orchard ground, establish trees in the drive row (aisle) of the previous orchard rather than the old tree row to minimize disease pressure. Field observations indicate tree growth response to this aisle-planting method is better than planting in the old row but not as good as fumigation. Plant as early as possible in the spring taking care not to skip important preplant operations.

4) Use 3 tons/treated acre of equal parts yellow mustard () and white mustard () seed meal as a preplant soil amendment in the fall prior to planting in combination with a postplant application of mefenoxam may yield effective control of this disease complex.

5) Provide proper management practices from plant nutrition to irrigation.

6) Use resistant rootstocks, such as Geneva 30, 41, 210, 214, 890, and 935.

","Preplant fumigation is very effective and, although expensive, will eventually pay for itself during a typical orchard lifetime. Consult or hire a professional applicator to be sure it is done safely and effectively.


1) Metam-sodium products such as Metam CLR (42%), Sectagon 42, or Vapam HL. Vapam HL can be used at 56 to 75 gal/A. Use in enough water to penetrate only 3 ft. Remove as much tree root debris as possible before application. Trees adjacent to the treatment site may be injured. 5-day reentry.

2) Telone C-17 (Telone plus chloropicrin) at 32.4 to 42 gal/A depending on soil type and depth of penetration. Do not use Telone alone; it has not been effective in eastern Washington. 5-day reentry.

","Soil replacement with new soil or well-prepared, steamed planting soil mixture, or soil replacement with a ratio of 1 part peat to 2 parts planting-hole soil. Data indicate that a hole 6 foot square or more and 3 ft deep gives best long term control.


"
Apple ,(Malus spp.)-Rubbery Wood and Flat Limb,"These diseases are caused by an unknown graft-transmissible agent. They were assumed to be caused by phytoplasmas, but repeated attempts to confirm this association have failed. Many old rootstocks introduced from Europe were uniformly infected with the pathogens that cause these diseases.


","On many commercial cultivars, there are no acute symptoms, although fruit quality and yield may be adversely affected. On sensitive cultivars, branches fail to develop properly and remain very pliable and droop under their own weight. The affected limbs are also more prone to cold and frost damage than healthy limbs. On cultivars such as Gravenstein, the disease appears as a flattening of shoots and limbs on 2- to 3-year old growth. As the branches become older, the flattening becomes more pronounced and deep furrows develop. Trees exhibit reduced production, and the diseased limbs are very prone to breaking.
Both types of symptom are more severe in moderate climates and less severe in warmer environments.


","The use of certified virus-tested (and found to be free of all known viruses) propagation material has dramatically decreased the incidence of these diseases.

Apple ,(Malus spp.)-Rust,,,,,
Apple ,(Malus spp.)-Scab,"Venturia inaequalis, a fungal disease that is common and destructive west of the Cascade Range in Oregon and Washington and coastal British Columbia. There is an average of 8 infection periods each year lasting an average of 28.5 hours (as calculated for western Oregon from 1989 to 2001). Economically important scab outbreaks can also occur in central Washington, Hood River, and eastern and southern Oregon. In these more arid districts, the disease is more of a problem when overtree irrigation is practiced.
The fungus overwinters on dead apple leaves or fruit on the ground. During winter, black structures (pseudothecia) develop in the dead tissue. During the spring, in the presence of moisture and over a wide range of temperatures, pseudothecia produce sexual spores (ascospores), which are forcibly discharged and moved by air currents to infect young developing foliage and fruit. Infections are visible 8 to 15 days later. They in turn produce asexual spores (conidia) in 15 to 18 days whenever weather conditions are favorable. Conidia cause new infections, continuing the disease cycle.
All outer parts of unopened fruit buds are highly susceptible to infection when exposed after cluster buds break. Bud or blossom infection often leads to shedding of blossoms or to severe infection of developing fruit. Preventing infection of flower stalks and sepals is important for successful scab management.
Mature apple fruit are much less susceptible to apple scab than immature fruit. However, infections can occur near harvest, which are not observed until apples are in storage. It can take as little as 6 hours of wetness at 70°F for infection of fruit around bloom, but it takes almost 48 hours of wetness at the same temperature to infect mature fruit.
Apple cultivars not easily grown in western Washington, Oregon, or British Columbia include Red Delicious, Rome Beauty, Jonathan, Winesap, Granny Smith, Gala, Summerred, and Jersey Mac.


","The first visible symptoms on leaves in spring are pale, chlorotic, water-soaked spots the size of a pinhead. These enlarge, becoming darker and smoky in appearance, later taking on an olive shade and ultimately a brownish black color. Spots may be any shape but are frequently circular. Young infections often show a radiating spread of fungal tissue through the leaf, and such areas later appear as irregular, brown-colored infections. Diseased leaves can be curled and distorted and often drop early, thus defoliating and weakening the tree.
Scab spots on fruits are at first small, raised, brown or black circular areas with no skin breaks. Later the skin ruptures, and the exposed tissue has a brown or black velvet-like appearance surrounded by a whitish ring or torn cuticle tissue. As fruit develops, scab spots enlarge and the central areas become brown and corky, but the dark marginal zones remain. Scabs may be scattered over the fruit surface and, when numerous, coalesce into larger irregular infections. Such fruit often cracks, allowing fruit-rotting organisms into the apple.
Late-season infections may not show on fruit until they are in storage where rough, black, circular lesions develop. The lesions, usually varying in size up to 0.25 inch in diameter, are sometimes referred to as pinpoint scab or storage scab.


","

1) Some apple cultivars have shown good resistance and good quality. These cultivars are Akane (Tokyo Rose), Chehalis, Liberty, Prima, and Tydeman Red.Intermediate resistance apple cultivars are Jonagold, Macoun, Melrose, Spartan, and King. Cultivars Pristine and Enterprise have both powdery mildew and scab resistance.

2) Apply nitrogen (5% urea) to leaves (on or off the tree) in fall to enhance decomposition of fallen leaves and make them more palatable to earthworms. The organic equivalent would be the application of 30% yeast extract.

3) Shred fallen leaves with a flail mower to help speed decomposition of infected leaves.

4) Homeowners may reduce disease pressure by raking and disposing of leaves after they fall. If put in a compost pile, be sure leaves decompose completely.

5) Pruning also helps increase air flow and reduces the amount of time foliage is wet from rain or dew.

6) Reduce irrigation sets so leaves do not stay wet for extended periods of time. Use sprinkler heads that do not wet the foliage of the tree or use drip irrigation.

7) Apply dolomitic lime in fall, after leaf drop, to increase soil pH and to help reduce inoculum next spring.

","The key to successfully controlling scab is to apply fungicides early and thoroughly to protect new growth. The first susceptible tissues exposed in opening cluster buds are the tips of the leaves and sepals. The most critical period for scab development is from the breaking of the cluster buds until leaves are fully expanded. Apply sprays at prepink, pink, calyx, and first cover. If the disease was a problem last year, begin applications at green-tip. Forecasting also can be used to time fungicide spray especially in arid regions with few infection periods
Scab resistance to certain fungicides can occur if these materials are used exclusively or excessively. Resistance to Syllit still persists in Quebec Canada and thus likely other places where it was overused. In one study up to 12% of the isolates were resistant to 4 different fungicide groups at the same time. To minimize the development of resistant fungi, alternate or tank-mix fungicides from different groups that have different modes of action. For example, use a tank-mix of a Group 3 fungicide at full rate plus a different fungicide at lower rate. Some products used in the tank-mix will also aid in bull's-eye rot control. Also, limit applications from any particular group to three (3) or fewer per year. In Pennsylvania, not using dormant copper sprays, older trees, larger orchards, orchards with ≤10 cultivars, and application of >4 DMI sprays were positively correlated with the incidence of resistant apple scab isolates. Use of delayed dormant copper-based sprays reduced DMI-resistant fungi in New York and may be very useful for management in the PNW.

Apple ,(Malus spp.)-Scar Skin and Dapple Apple,"These diseases are caused by Apple scar skin viroid. Many infected cultivars of apple or pear do not express symptoms of disease. It has become a problem when old orchards are top worked, and the new scion is susceptible to the viroid that had been symptomless in the original cultivar. Pear also appears to be a symptomless carrier of Apple scar skin viroid. The pathogen occasionally spreads slowly in the orchard, but the mechanism(s) is not known as there is no known insect vector. It has been suggested that root grafts may account for this slow spread. It can be seedborne as well as transmitted with contaminated scissors.


","Affected fruit bears small circular spots near the calyx end of the fruit. As the fruit matures, the spots enlarge and the spots increasingly contrast with the darkening background color of the fruit. Larger spots may coalesce to form a broad band of dappling. In the case of the more severe scar skin, the circular patches become brown and necrotic, and fissures appear on the fruit. The affected fruit is smaller than fruit of unaffected trees.


","

1) Use virus-tested (and found to be free of all known viruses) certified material.

2) Use a disinfestant on contaminated pruning or cutting equipment.

3) Temperature therapy of infected stock and subsequent propagation of juvenile tissue has been successful.

Apple ,(Malus spp.)-Storage Problems,"There are many storage rots, which are mainly caused by fungi. A survey of 'Red Delicious', 'Fuji', and 'Golden Delicious' fruit after harvest in Washington found that gray mold (Botrytis cinerea) and Sphaeropsis rot (Sphaeropsis pyriputrescens) caused 28% and 17% of the total decay, respectively. Speck rot (Phacidiopycnis washingtonensis) occurred sporadically. Lambertella rot (Lambertella corni-maris) has also been described from brown, spongy decays originating in wounded apples. Crabapple pollinizers can be very susceptible to these fungi and may be a significant source of inoculum for many of these fungal rots. Many of these biotic problems can cause decay on pear as well and are covered in a separate section on Pear-Storage Rots. Several other abiotic disorders including bitter pit, Jonathan spot, lenticel breakdown, scald, and water core, can be problematic on apple after harvest.
Bitter pit is a physiological disorder resulting from calcium deficiency in the fruit. It can develop within the first month or two of cold storage. Conditioning 'Honeycrisp' after harvest, a common practice, can exacerbate bitter pit.
Jonathan spot occurs on cultivars Jonathan, Golden Delicious, Idared, Newtown, Northern Spy, Rome Beauty, and Wealthy. It is often but not always associated with lenticels. The disorder may appear before harvest but usually after long-term regular air storage.
Lenticel breakdown is a skin disorder that becomes more of a problem, as large, mature apples are held longer in storage. Late-harvested fruit and those with a mineral imbalance are more susceptible. Although lenticel breakdown can be seen on many cultivars, 'Gala' apples are generally more susceptible. Some postharvest practices such as washing fruit with high concentrations of soap or running fruit through hot dump tank water can worsen the symptoms.
Scald is a cosmetic problem where a few layers of cells immediately beneath the skin turn brown. Fruit may look fine in cold storage but symptoms may become visible after a few days at room temperature. Fruit immaturity, high nitrogen, low calcium, warm preharvest weather, delayed cold storage, high storage temperature and high storage humidity are factors that can increase scald severity. Cultivars like Granny Smith and Red Delicious are the most susceptible while cultivars Fuji, Gala, and Pink Lady are usually much less susceptible.
Sodium burn occurs when water systems have been used for long periods with regular additions of sodium hypochlorite. The sodium accumulates in the water solution and can cause peel browning at 100 ppm or greater. Cultivars such as Gala, Granny Smith, and Fuji are the most susceptible, as are pears.
Soggy breakdown is an internal browning due to very low storage temperatures and can be very problematic on 'Honeycrisp'.
Water core is due to liquid-soaked tissue around the vascular bundles of the apple. Fruit with mild symptoms may recover; whereas, severe soaking leads to internal browning and breakdown.


","Bitter pit is distinguished by  circular or slightly irregular depressed spots that appear on the fruit surface, beneath which are brownish or streaked necrotic areas. Pitting (discrete necrotic spots) may not always be visible from the outside of the fruit. Necrotic tissue is usually soft until it dries out. Pits are more common on the calyx-end (blossom end) of the fruit but can occur all over the fruit surface.
Jonathan spot may only show as small brown-to-black spots localized around lenticels. Spots may sunken but generally do not affect the flesh. On the surface, spots can enlarge, coalesce, and turn from yellow to light or dark brown and eventually black. Symptoms may be less frequent at the calyx end compared to blush areas.
Lenticel breakdown is characterized by small, necrotic, sunken or pitted areas centered on the lenticel. Spots may be pinpointed or enlarged to several millimeters.
Scald develops as a general surface browning of the skin and can be more severe on the shaded side of the fruit. Light-to-dark-brown discoloration of the peel occurs in patches around the fruit surface but especially at the calyx end (blossom end). In severe cases, the cuticle becomes wrinkled in appearance.
Sodium burn symptoms include skin browning especially near the calyx bowl where liquid residual water can increase sodium hypochlorite accumulation but can also develop on fruit shoulders and on bruised or cracked areas. Symptoms usually, take several weeks in cold storage before they become visible.
Water core, which is observed mainly near the core when apples are cut open, appears as water-soaked, glassy core that may harden. Eventually, severe internal browning and breakdown may become visible from the outside.


","

1) Harvesting apples at the proper stage of maturity is critical to reduce the impact of many disorders.

2) Quick cooling and low storage temperatures help manage some of these. Controlled atmospheres can help manage Jonathan spot and scald but should be set carefully in a way not to exacerbate other potential disorders.

3) Conditioning stored apples at slightlywarmer temperatures can help detect scalded fruit which are culled before shipping.

4) Several calcium applications in the orchard are more effective in preventing bitter pit than drenching fruit after harvest with a calcium solution.

5) The concentration of sodium hypochlorite in flume-tank water should be monitored continuously and water replaced very frequently. The use of a non-sodium-based sanitizer and an additional fresh water rinse may reduce sodium burn.

6) Manage diseases on crabapple pollinizers (like 'Manchurian') such as pruning out cankers and dead twigs that could harbor fungal problems.

","See also Pear - Storage Rots for chemical control of pathogens.


1) Antioxidants, such as dephenylamine for apples and ethoxyquin for pears, have been useful for scald control.

2) SmartFresh (1-MCP) applications shortly after harvest can significantly reduce superficial scald on apples. Additional information is available on the label. Increased lenticel breakdown, especially on 'Gala' has, been reported on apple stored in controlled-atmospheres.

Apple ,(Malus spp.)-Union Necrosis and Decline,"Tomato ringspot virus is spread by dagger nematodes, Xiphinema americanum (sensu lato). The virus occurs in many areas of Eastern North America, and has been reported occasionally in the Pacific Northwest and California. The host range of the virus is wide including many fruit, ornamental, and vegetable crops as well as many weeds.


","Signs of infection do not appear until the infected tree approaches fruit bearing age. At that time, the tree exhibits an unthrifty growth habit associated with an abnormally high fruit set. Symptoms may also include reddish coloration of the leaves and bark. In severe cases, a dark necrotic line will appear at the graft union flanked by spongy orange tissue.


","Primary control is by planting virus-tested (and found to be free of all known viruses) trees and in sites that have no history of the disease.

","


1) Disease development can be delayed and perhaps controlled by suppressing nematodes by preplant fumigation if planting in a contaminated site.

2) Use virus and nematode resistant rootstock.

",
Apple ,(Malus spp.)-Virus Diseases,"Many apple trees in the Pacific Northwest are carrying one or more latent viruses. Most infections by the ""latent viruses"" do not cause disease symptoms or reduce tree growth or yield on commercial cultivars.
Several nematode-transmitted viruses have been associated with virus-induced incompatibility. Strains of Tomato ringspot virus (TmRSV) have been isolated from declining apple trees in states along the East Coast and in Michigan and Oregon. Similar symptoms also have been observed in trees where TmRSV has not been isolated.
Other virus or virus-like abnormalities observed in the Pacific Northwest include star crack on 'Gravenstein' and flat apple on several cultivars.


","Symptom expression varies considerably among cultivars and among strains of the same virus. Thus the scion may be symptomless and the rootstock very sensitive. All other combinations also have been reported such as rootstock symptomless and scion very susceptible, both scion and rootstock susceptible, and both symptomless. When a virus enters the symptomless portion of the tree, reaction may be severe when the virus reaches the sensitive portion. This may cause cell death at the graft union and result in virus-induced incompatibility. The resulting symptoms are those of decline, collapse, or tree breakage.
Fruits on the flat-apple-affected trees are smaller, flatter, and show a tendency for the calyx end to be open.
Latent viruses in apples are very harmful to many crabapples. Symptoms in crabapples include stem pitting, foliage spotting, misshapen fruit, and tree decline or collapse.
Considerable russet ring symptoms have been observed in the Hood River, Oregon area. These superficial rings occur on the fruit and can be as large as a half-dollar. Cultivars affected were Golden Delicious and Newtown.


","

1) Plant virus-indexed (and found to be free of all known viruses) trees.

2) If replanting in virus-infected areas of the orchard, use both rootstocks and scions that are tolerant of the virus.

3) The practice of top-working apple trees to 'Hyslop', 'Columbia', 'Virginia Crab', or other crab seedlings is strongly discouraged.

","Leaves develop small, round, tan to purplish spots that are seldom larger than 0.25 inch wide. Tissue becomes somewhat raised and scurfy and often drops out in dry, warm weather, producing a shothole effect. Fruit symptoms are similar and can be accompanied by a clear, gummy exudate. Small red fruit spots may be numerous and slightly sunken. On dormant shoots, buds often are killed, but very few twig infections occur. Twig symptoms include small necrotic spots that become larger and sunken. Defoliation and fruit drop can occur when the disease is severe.

Arborvitae ,(Thuja occidentalis)-Black Flagging,"The absence of disease organisms, insects, or mites associated with this condition suggests the problem is due to stress of some sort. The exact source of stress that results in black flagging is unknown. Water stress, drying winds, high temperatures, injury to the roots, or damage to lower stems are possibilities. In some instances, black flagging has occurred when none of these conditions have been present.
This problem has been widely observed on arborvitae from all regions in Oregon, as well as from Washington, Idaho, and numerous other states across the country. Repeated incubations and isolations from affected tissue onto nutrient media, by multiple diagnosticians across the country, have consistently failed to produce any disease-causing microorganisms. The injury is not caused by insects mining in the foliage, nor is it due to girdling twig cankers. Sprays of insecticides and fungicides have no effect on reducing incidence of the discoloration.
Occasionally, the injury can be traced to chemical applications, which will be reflected in the spray pattern. For example, if the trees are growing as a hedge on the border between two properties, and only one side sprayed, then the injury will appear on only the sprayed side.


","Only younger foliage is affected. Branch tips show a very dark-brown to black discoloration of the foliage-the color is not the brown associated with normal or disease-induced leaf senescence. This can occur on only one side, be evenly distributed over the entire plant, or occur only on some branches. Plants with black flagging are not permanently disfigured or injured. The condition does not always recur on an individual plant.


","Since this is not a disease or insect/mite problem, no pesticide applications are recommended.

1) Prune the affected foliage to remove the unsightly tissue. Pruning allows more light in and stimulates growth of new foliage.

2) Water regularly to the base of the plant during dry periods.

3) Fertilize in spring to stimulate production of new foliage.

",,
Arborvitae ,(Thuja occidentalis)-Root Rot,"Several. Many samples sent to the OSU Plant Clinic are from poorly drained and wet sites where oxygen depletion to the roots is likely. Occasionally, pathogens such as Phytophthora lateralis or Armillaria ostoyae (may be refered to as A. solidipes in some publications) are associated with rotted roots. The latter may be found on ground recently cleared of native forest vegetation.
Cultivars and species differ in susceptibility to Phytophthora root rot. Western red cedar (Thuja plicata) is most resistant, T. occidentalis 'Pyramidalis' is intermediate, and T. occidentalis 'Smaragd' is most susceptible.


","Aboveground symptoms are general discoloration of foliage and eventual death. Roots are discolored below the bark in the region of the cambium. Roots in advanced stages are highly decomposed and break off easily.


","

1) Avoid reusing pots from a previous crop for propagation. If pots must be reused then wash off all debris and soak in a sanitizing solution or treat with aerated steam for 30 min.

2) Plant only in deep, well-drained soil.

3) Correct drainage if water puddles near bushes.

4) Use resistant species or cultivars.

5) Permanently removing soil and exposing the crown and main root areas has been effective for  control in tree fruits grown in California and Australia and may be of benefit for managing infected bushes in the Pacific Northwest.

","Not recommended unless Phytophthora sp. has been identified. Even then, plants are most likely too far gone for chemical therapy to work. The Group 4 and Group 33 fungicides used to manage Phytophthora do not kill this organism. They can only prevent establishment of the organism before it gets into the plant. They can also prevent continued growth if the organism is already inside the plant thereby delaying symptoms that might have developed. Once chemical activity has subsided with time, the organism can resume growth within infected plants. Rotate fungicides from different groups that have a different mode of action for resistance management.

Arugula ,(Eruca sativa)-Phoma Stem Canker (Black Leg),"Leptosphaeria maculans (syn. Plenodomus lingam, anamorph: Phoma lingam) is a fungus that can infect a range of cruciferous crops. Host plants also include Brassica crops (broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cabbage, collards, canola, kale, mizuna, mustard greens, rutabaga, turnip, etc.), Sinapis (white and yellow mustard), and Raphanus (daikon and radish). Cruciferous weeds common in the Pacific Northwest can be host to black leg, including: birdsrape mustard (Brassica rapa), black mustard (B. nigra), western yellow cress or curvepod yellowcress (Rorippa curvisiliqua), tansymustard (Descurainia pinnata), hedge mustard (Sisymbrium officinale), tumble mustard (S. altissimum), small tumbleweed mustard (S. loeselii), pennycress (Thlaspi arvense), mouseear cress (Arabidopsis thaliana), annual wallrocket (Diplotaxis muralis), perennial wallrocket (D. tenuifolia), and wild radish (Raphanus raphanistrum). The fungus survives on living plants as pycnidia, which produce water-splashed pycnidiospores, or with plant debris as pycnidia and/or pseudothecia. Pseudothecia release ascospores that may be windborne long distances, at least several miles and perhaps further on storm fronts. The fungus survives in association with infected plant residues until the plant debris decomposes (up to 4 years). When residues are on the soil surface, ascospores are released from the pseudothecia following wet or humid conditions and when mean temperatures are between 46°F and 59°F. Conditions conducive for ascospore production and release commonly occur during the fall, winter, and springtime throughout the Pacific Northwest. Trap plants deployed weekly in multiple sites around the Willamette Valley in western Oregon beginning in October 2014 and 2015, showed that ascospore infections began around mid-October. During 2015-2016, ascospore infections of trap plants occurred from mid-October into May with severe disease pressure during February and March. Wounding, insect injury, or herbic 0ºide injury can result in greater disease severity.
Two types of pycnidia (which produce asexual spores known as pycnidiospores) can be found; one on infected, live plants (thinner-walled pycnidium with a neck) and the other on crop residues (thicker-walled pycnidium with a narrow ostiole). Pycnidiospores are dispersed by splashing rain or irrigation water, so pycnidiospore movement is limited to relatively short distances, but pycnidiospores can add to the overall incidence and severity of disease within a field. Workers or equipment moving through infected plantings during wet conditions can spread disease.
Black leg can also move with infected seed, Leptosphaeria can survive for years in association with seed. But if, as a general practice, seed lots used for planting are Leptosphaeria-free then the spread of regional epidemics is thought to arise from infected plant debris. Even low levels of seed infection, when coupled with weather favorable for disease, can lead to severe losses, including stand die-out within a field. The Oregon Department of Agriculture requires that all crucifer seed, even half ounce or smaller packets, that is to be planted in Oregon must be accompanied by an official test showing that the untreated seed is free from black leg (Leptosphaeria species).


","Infected seed can result in stem lesions and small dark spots on cotyledons; seedling death may occur and resembles damping-off. Plants that survive black leg at the seeding stage from seedborne inoculum exhibit stunting, dark, irregular leaf spots, and blackish stem lesions.


",,"Seed treatment is essential if growing seed fields. Infected seed can occur in seed lots, certified to be free of black leg, at levels below the detection threshold by seed testing, and chemical or hot water seed treatments will aid in controlling disease introduction by infected seed.


",
Arugula ,(Eruca sativa)-Stem and Root Rot,"The fungus, Rhizoctonia solani, which can survive in soil for many years. Wind and water can move infested soil and plant debris. Rhizoctonia solani becomes active when soil is 77°F to 91°F, attacking any part of the plant underground (soil contact). The fungus is favored by poor soil structure and high soil moisture. Moisture or nutritional stress or injuries can predispose the crop to infection by R. solani. This pathogen can also cause post-emergence damping-off, resulting in reduced stands.


","Above ground portions of the plant wilt, and plants may die. Lateral roots are absent or entirely decayed. Tap roots are entirely decayed or show large, dark lesions along their entire length. Symptomatic plants are often found in wet areas of the field.

Ash ,(Fraxinus spp.)-Verticillium Wilt,"Verticillium dahliae, a soilborne fungus that, once established in the soil, is almost impossible to eradicate due to microsclerotia that germinate and infect roots. The fungus grows into the xylem where it colonizes the plant through mycelial growth and conidial production. Fluid movement in the xylem passively transports the conidia. Once in the xylem, this fungus partially blocks water movement and produces toxins that result in wilt symptoms. After diseased plant parts die, microsclerotia form and live several years in soil. Many weeds are susceptible and can help the fungus survive and disperse.


","Ash rarely produces the wilting and vascular discoloration common to other hosts such as maple. Foliage turns light green and chlorotic followed by a leaf scorch and premature defoliation. Older leaves seem to defoliate first, according to observations from local nurseries. Upper branches die back in a random or one-sided distribution on the tree. Branches tend to die back in summer after the first heat stress of the year. Trees infected in the nursery often develop symptoms within 1 to 3 years after planting but can remain symptomless for longer periods. Symptom expression will vary in intensity from year to year. Send samples to a laboratory for accurate diagnosis.

The diseases that have been implicated include Fusarium crown and root rot, rust, Stemphylium purple spot, and a few viruses.


","A slow productivity decline in old asparagus plantings. This includes a reduction in spear size and numbers and eventual death of the crown. The problem usually appears once seasonal harvest begins.


","

1) Correct any soil-related problems such as pH and compaction before planting.

2) Plant certified-virus-free seed in fields that have not been planted to asparagus before.

3) Manage the major insect, disease, and weed pests affecting asparagus.

Asparagus ,(Asparagus sp.)-Fusarium Crown and Root Rot,"Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. asparagi, F. proliferatum, and F. redolens, fungi that persist in soil and can be seed-transmitted. High soil temperatures (optimum about 82°F) favor the disease, which is more severe on plants in light soils. Low soil pH, poor soil drainage, or low levels of available Mn in soil may all favor disease. A high soil K to Mg ratio, if it creates a Mg deficiency, is associated with disease. These soil factors may negatively impact plant growth, making plants more susceptible.


","Yellowing, stunting, and wilting of the stalk and ferns. Reddish lesions can develop on stalks bases. Rusty red discoloration of vascular bundles can be detected in roots, crowns, or stems. Fine roots rot away while storage roots eventually collapse from rot. Rot of the crown leads to plant death.


","

1) Rotate with grasses and cereals.

2) Plant only transplants grown from treated seed on clean ground.

3) Avoid planting crowns too deeply in the ground,

4) The cultivars UC72, UC500, and UC66 are moderately resistant in California but not in eastern Washington.

5) NaCl fertilization has been reported to reduce root lesions by promoting changes in the rhizosphere (root-soil interface).

Asparagus ,(Asparagus sp.)-Rust,"Puccinia asparagi, an autoecious macrocyclic rust fungus that overwinters on old asparagus stems. The summer spore stage, which is the most damaging stage, is windborne and may go through several cycles in a growing season. Reduced size and storage reserves in the crowns weakens plants and reduces yields the following season.


","The first signs of the disease in the spring are oval yellowish spots (aecia and pycnia) on stems. These spots, usually not abundant and often overlooked, contain fruiting bodies of the fungus. The summer spore stage appears as pustules (uredinia), blister-like in appearance, which break through the epidermis to expose brownish, powdery spore masses. In late summer and autumn, black spore masses (telia) appear in the same spots where the brown summer pustules were produced, or in separate pustules. When infection is widespread, plant vigor is reduced and the crop matures abnormally early.

Aspen ,(Populus tremuloides)-Armillaria Root Rot,,,,,
Aspen ,(Populus tremuloides)-Aspen Trunk Rot,"The fungus Phellinus tremulae incites a common heartrot of aspen, which can be found in just about every PNW grove. It is critically important for wildlife tree-cavity formation. Studies in drier forests of the PNW indicate that aspen groves are hotspots for wildlife habitat, with a major ""cavity nest web"" that develops, started by primary excavating woodpeckers, and then including swallows, nuthatches, bats, and other mammals, etc. The presence of a single fruiting body (conk) indicates considerable decay up to as much as 82% of the tree volume. Spores are released throughout the growing season and infect dead branches, branch stubs or wounds. New fruiting bodies may not be formed for several years after initial infection.


","There are often no external indicators of this decay until a fruiting body is formed. The fruiting bodies form at branch scars and are perennial, hard and woody with a triangular shape in longitudinal section. The upper and lower surface of the conk is roughly at a 45° angle. The upper surface is zoned gray to black while the bottom is brown. Decayed wood in fresh cut trees is yellowish, white and spongy with a distinct wintergreen odor.


","Protecting aspen from stem wounds and fire damage and maintaining dense stands may reduce incidence of decay.

",,
Aspen ,(Populus tremuloides)-Black Canker (Target Canker),"The fungus Ceratocystis fimbriata causes a canker disease that has been reported as common in surveys of Oregon and Washington. The fungus is vectored by many different beetles and some flies that are attracted to fresh wounds. Wounds may be in the form of branch stubs, primary insect attack, fire scars, or any other physical injury. Infected trees are susceptible to wind breakage. Black canker is usually slow growing, taking years to kill individual trees.
Other canker diseases include sooty-bark, Cryptosphaeria, and Cytospora cankers. Cytospora commonly shows up as a secondary invader of the already dead tissue.


","Cankers are perennial but slowly expand each year resulting in a zonate elliptical area. Sometimes called a ""target canker"" based on these symptoms. These lens-shaped areas are about 1.5 feet long and sunken. Bark in the canker is blackened but may look varnished due to orange dried sap exudations. Cankers can occur anywhere along the stem or branch. Twigs, branches, and trees are killed once girdled. Secondary problems, such as other cankers and insects, can move in and kill these stressed trees.


","

1) Keep trees in good vigor and avoid wounding.

2) Remove and destroy cankered trees.

3) Partial harvest of stands is strongly discouraged.

",,
Aspen ,(Populus tremuloides)-Cryptosphaeria Canker (Snake Canker),"The canker disease caused by the fungus Cryptosphaeria ligniota has been reported in both Oregon and Washington and is an important killer of aspen.The fungus can infect aspen, bigtooth aspen, eastern cottonwood, Lombardy poplar, and purple willow. Cankers are associated with trunk or branch wounds. Perithecia develop in bark once it has been dead for one year. Spores are shed during late spring and summer rains. Mortality usually occurs in small trees after only a few years and before the canker girdles the stem. Large trees may be killed more slowly as the canker affects their branches. Especially on large trees, branches may be infected first, from which the fungus can spread to the stem.
Other canker diseases include sooty-bark, black, and Cytospora cankers. Cytospora commonly shows up as a secondary invader of the already dead tissue.


","Cankers with orange-brown margins may only be 2 to 5 inches wide but expand along the trunk up to 10 feet. Discolored bark may extend well below the cankered area. These long narrow cankers, which may extend the length of the trunk, develop black dots (perithecia) in the bark after a year. A red heartwood stain and advanced, brown-mottled trunk decay occur in the cankered area. Dead bark adheres tightly to cankers.

Aspen ,(Populus tremuloides)-Cytospora Canker,"Cytospora chrysosperma has been reported from all three Pacific Northwest States. This disease is widespread and common on poplar, cottonwood, aspen, and willow; occasionally on mountain ash, maple, and cherry. Although the disease is found on many hosts, the fungi responsible may be host specific. Isolates from aspen or cottonwood were not pathogenic on alder, ash, elm or willow but were able to infect each other. The fungus is generally considered weakly parasitic entering through wounds that may be due to frost, sunscald, heat and drought stress, insect damage or browsing damage by elk, deer, or domestic livestock. Weakened trees are more susceptible.
Other canker diseases include Black, Cryptosphaeria, and sooty-bark cankers.


","Young twigs develop brownish, sunken, roughly circular areas in the bark. The fungus may grow down the twig and into larger branches on the trunk. Large cankers may be on branches and trunks. Infected bark discolors to orange or orange-brown and eventually darkens to black. This orange-brown bark discoloration is the most common and easily observed symptom and is frequently accompanied by an orange-brown liquid ooze. Pycnidia in the bark give the canker surface a pimpled appearance. Later, a perithecial stroma develops in the dead, cankered areas. Twigs and smaller branches may die back without definite cankers. Cankers may enlarge over time, killing the tree or predisposing it to damage by other agents including wind.


","

1) Keep trees in good vigor and avoid wounding.

2) Conifer control will help reduce moisture stress and increase sunlight. Do not injure aspen when conifers are removed.

3) Minimize livestock browsing with fencing. Conifer slash left within an aspen grove can also help deter cattle from grazing.

4) Remove and destroy dead or severely cankered branches.

Aspen ,(Populus tremuloides)-Sooty-bark Canker,"The fungus Encoelia pruinosa causes a very aggressive canker disease on mature trees and is relatively common in several aspen areas in Oregon and Washington. It is fairly common in aspen stands of the Blue and Wallowa Mountains. This canker is a problem after stand disturbance such as thinning or selective logging. Sooty-bark is also a problem in high-use campsite areas. Ascospores from infected or dead trees infect wounds any place on the trunk. Cankers enlarge quickly but trees do not form defensive ridges of callus. Once the bark falls off, numerous gray apothecia form in the blackened areas. When dry the apothecial cups curl up but open up when wet for a length of time.
Other canker diseases include Black, Cryptosphaeria, and Cytospora cankers. Cytospora commonly shows up as a secondary invader of the already dead tissue.


","Sunken elliptical areas first appear with blackened cambium. This blackened or sooty area remains on the tree even after the bark sloughs off. The sooty residue is often spotted in appearance on old cankered bark (sometimes referred to as leopard spotting). Cankers are at first 1 ft wide and 3 ft long but can later expand up to 12 ft long or more. Cankers are perennial and continue to expand each year around the tree trunk giving it a slightly zonal look. Canker margins do not look raised. Cankers on mature trees are often long with a spiral twisting along their length. Numerous gray dots, apothecia, appear within the blackened area. Mature trees can be girdled in a few years.

Aster,Wilt,"Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. callistephi, a fungus that is soilborne, remains indefinitely, and also is carried on the seed and seed debris. It survives for years in the soil as thick-walled, dormant chlamydospores. These spores germinate in response to exudates from nearby plant roots. Hyphae then penetrate the roots, colonize the cortex and move into the xylem tissue. Small spores, microconidia are produced and carried up into the plant. At least 4 races have been identified. Races of the fungus routinely overcome resistant plants.


","Damping-off of young seedlings is common where the stems rot at the soil line, fall over, and die. Older affected plants that survive may be severely stunted, have brown lower leaves and can wilt during the heat of the day. Sometimes a one-sided wilt development occurs on stunted plants. Brown discoloration of vascular tissue often is noticeable in tissue near base of stem. Wilting of lower leaves is common, as is the drooping of flower heads.

Bury the edges of the plastic to trap the heat. Solarize for 4-6 weeks (or longer) during the hottest part of the summer, beginning in early- to mid-July.

6) Avoid reusing pots or trays from a previous crop for propagation. If pots must be reused then wash off all debris and soak in a sanitizing solution or treat with aerated steam for 30 min.

7) Destroy all infected plants.

8) Do not spread soil from diseased to healthy areas.

Aster,Yellows,"Candidatus Phytoplasma asteris formerly referred to as a mycoplasma-like organism. This organism has a wide host range. Some of the 170 plant species that may be affected are: anemone, calendula, chrysanthemum, coreopsis, cosmos, delphinium, daisy, marigold, gladiolus, golden-glow, petunia, phlox, and statice. Many vegetables also are affected including carrot, squash, and tomato. The main vector of this organism is the six-spotted leafhopper. The phytoplasma multiplies in the insect; however, there is a delay of 10 days or more after the insect feeds on a diseased plant before it can infect a healthy specimen. There is no transmission by seed or through insect eggs.


","Vein clearing, yellowing, and distortion of new leaves can occur. Plant is stunted but has stiff, erect appearance and many shoots. Affected plant may not produce flowers; if present, they are usually a greenish-yellow color and leaf-like.


","

1) Plant more thickly than usual and rogue out affected plants.

2) Shading asters reduces leafhopper feeding and hence disease transmission.

3) Fine mesh nets or screens can be used on greenhouse vents and doors to prevent leafhopper entry.

4) See  for more information on leafhopper control.

5) Control weeds in and near plantings.

Azalea ,(Rhododendron spp.)-Botrytis Petal Blight,"Botrytis cinerea, a fungus. This disease often follows mechanical damage or environmental stress. It can also develop on plants overwintered in unheated plastic houses when moisture develops on the canopy. Long wet periods favor disease development. The fungus colonizes dead or dying tissue such as fallen leaves and petals. This material may serve as a source of inoculum.


","Brown, water-soaked spots on leaves, which later produce a gray-brown mass of spores. Small, water-soaked lesions on petals also develop the characteristic gray fungal growth. Spots are similar to those produced by Ovulinia but do not enlarge as much or as quickly.

Azalea ,(Rhododendron spp.)-Cutting Rots,,,,,
Azalea ,(Rhododendron spp.)-Cylindrocladium Blight and Root Rot,"Cylindrocladium scoparium, (sexual Calonectria morganii), a fungus but other species can be involved. The disease has been a problem only in greenhouses. Microsclerotia that form in plant tissues can survive many years in soil or media. New infected cuttings from other facilities can also bring in inoculum. Cuttings may have small inconspicuous leaf spots. High humidity and high temperatures (85°F) favor fungus growth. Spores may be carried in soil, water, by the wind, or on hands. Conidia that land on leaves or flowers germinate and penetrate through stomata or directly through the epidermis. Spoulation will not occur in leaf or flower spots while still attached to the plant. Once these tissues fall from the plant the fungus colonizes and forms microsclerotia. Microsclerotia can now produce conidia that keep the cycle going.
Conidia can also be washed into soil or media. The fungus may invade roots' vascular tissues. Vascular browning may occur up the stem, but the fungus does not progress more than an inch or so above the soil line. Even though the fungus often appears to have invaded at or near the soil line (possibly through wounds), it will invade roots. The fungus has been recovered from as deep as 12 inches in soil. Latent root infections where the fungus progresses slowly may account for many of the sudden wilts in plants that are several years old. Stress from shipping, repotting, extra watering, and fertilizing can trigger collapse symptoms.


","Cylindrocladium may cause a leaf spot, stem canker, flower spot, root rot, or quick wilt.
Leaf spots are discrete with necrotic centers. Spots are surrounded by a chlorotic halo on white cultivars and a light brown to pinkish zone on pink or red cultivars. Veins on the bottom of leaves may radiate pinkish red from spots on pink or red cultivars. Necrotic flecks may be seen on flowers before they collapse.
Above ground symptoms of root rot include stunting, foliage discoloration, and wilting. These symptoms may not occur until roots have been rotted for some time. Roots decay with a cortical rot. Vascular discoloration may extend beyond root lesions. Woody stems may also have an internal distinct brown discoloration.


","

1) Keep humidity as low as practical.

2) Use only disease-free cuttings in disease-free soil or soilless potting media. Tissue-culture source plants are another good way to break the cycle.

3) Remove and destroy infected plants and fallen leaves. In addition, cull healthy appearing plants around the known infected plants as they too may be infected. Be careful not to contaminate surrounding plants with contaminated soil or plant debris. Place diseased plants in a closed container if not immediately removed from the house.

4) Avoid reusing pots from a previous crop for propagation. If pots must be reused then wash off all debris then soak in a sanitizing solution or treat with aerated steam for 30 min.

","Successful only if combined with good sanitation and cultural controls. Spray stock plants prior to cutting selection. After cuttings are stuck, follow up with drenches.
Immersing cuttings in a fungicide or disinfectant solution for several minutes can be an effective control tactic but is not generally recommended. A few infected cuttings can contaminate the entire batch with disastrous results. It is better to use products before cuttings are taken and/or after sticking.

Azalea ,(Rhododendron spp.)-Leaf and Flower Gall,"Exobasidium vaccinii, a fungus that is believed to overwinter as spores adhering to bark and bud scales and to cause infection with the opening of buds in spring. Older leaves are resistant to infection. Infection is dependent on high humidity and moisture during bud break. Gall growth is due to plant cell division resulting from the stimulus of hyphal growth within host tissue. When galls are still soft, the fungus grows between epidermal cells, breaks the cuticle, and sporulates giving the gall a white cast. Diseased inflorescences of Rhododendron calendulaceum (flame azalea) produced fewer flowers, smaller individual flowers, and had a lower probability of producing fruit. Diseased branches were more likely to die the following year.
Occurrence in the Willamette Valley has been quite variable from severe for a few years, back to back, to hardly noticeable for several years in a row. Hosts of this fungus include Camellia, huckleberry (Vaccinium spp.), Kalmia, kinnikinnick, Leucothoe, madrone, Pieris, and salal.


","Either all or part of a leaf may become thickened, fleshy, and covered with a white bloom of spores. At first, diseased leaves are succulent and white, but they later shrink into hard, brown, gall-like bodies. Galls are composed of fungus-infected plant tissue.

2) Reduce greenhouse humidity.

3) Select less susceptible cultivars.

","Apply the first spray before budbreak in spring and the second spray 2 to 3 weeks later. Some references call for regular applications until all galls have dried up. Symptom reduction is then seen the following spring. Other references indicate chemical control is unsuccessful.

Azalea ,(Rhododendron spp.)-Ovulinia Petal Blight,"Ovulinia azaleae, a fungus, has been detected in areas west of the Cascade Range. The disease is important on many greenhouse-grown azaleas as well as field-grown rhododendron and azalea. Flowers are the only part of the plant affected. Most azaleas and rhododendrons are susceptible and may become infected if weather and inoculum conditions are favorable. The disease develops during rainy periods at flowering time. It overwinters as sclerotia on diseased petals on plants, on the soil surface, or in leaf mulch under bushes. Sclerotia germinate and give rise to stalked, cup-shaped apothecia. Mature ascospores are discharged from their apothecium. After primary infection, colonization, and the breakdown of flower tissue, numerous conidia form and are spread by splashing rain, insects, and wind. Kalmia flowers are sucecptible when grown close to infected Rhododendrons.


","Infected flowers first show small spots, about 1 mm in diameter, which appear water-soaked. Spots can occur on petals before they are fully open. Spots enlarge rapidly and become slimy. As the disease progress, entire petals become slimy and limp. Infected areas of flowers soon become tan or light brown; eventually entire flowers turn prematurely brown. Infected flowers may last only 2 to 3 days after they are fully opened. Those on lower limbs usually are infected first. Nearly all flowers on a plant become infected when disease conditions are optimum. Infected flowers dry and cling to the plant longer than uninfected flowers. Small, black sclerotia form on infected flowers 8 weeks later. Sclerotia are buried in petal tissue and are most common in the thick portion of the flower throat or tube.
The disease produces no symptoms on the vegetative portion of the plant. Botrytis petal blight causes spots that initially are similar to those of Ovulinia petal blight but do not enlarge as much or as rapidly. Also, Botrytis petal blight does not produce slimy petals.


","

1) Remove and destroy infected flowers. The practice of ""deadheading"" can be helpful.

2) Remove and destroy floral debris from the base of plants or pots. Carefully remove 1 inch of the media, mulch, or soil from around base of plants. Replace with fresh, clean mulch.

3) Avoid overhead irrigation.

4) Maintain greenhouse humidity below 85%.

5) Inspect and isolate any new shipments of plants.

6) Pruning will help improve air circulation and drying conditions. Thin dense plantings and/or remove lower branches where first infections are likely to occur.

","Apply protective fungicides just before floral bud break and then at recommended intervals during the bloom period. Alternate or tank-mix materials from different groups with different modes of action to delay or prevent buildup of resistant fungi. The use of chemicals to inhibit germination of sclerotia and destroying apothecia is possible but not very effective in the long run.

Azalea ,(Rhododendron spp.)-Phytophthora Root Rot and Wilt,,,,,
Azalea ,(Rhododendron spp.)-Powdery Mildew,"The fungus Erysiphe azaleae (formerly Microsphaera azaleae) is found in western Oregon and Washington and southern British Columbia on garden azalea and rhododendron species and hybrids. Erysiphe vaccinii (formerly Microsphaera vaccinii) has been found only on wild R. occidentale growing on the southern Oregon coast. The disease is most common on deciduous azaleas but not as frequent on evergreen azaleas. The cultivars Homebush and White Lights are susceptible to powdery mildew.
These fungi are obligate parasites that produce two kinds of spores. Asexual conidia are most frequent; they spread by wind and produce new colonies that produce more spores. Many infection cycles may occur in a summer. The disease develops late in summer, but overwintering colonies have been seen throughout the winter on leaves' undersides. Sexual spores are produced in small, black, spherical structures (chasmothecia). They are produced in fall in great numbers on azalea. High humidity and high nitrogen fertility favors the disease.


","White powdery spots develop on young leaves. The whitish growth can occur on both sides of the leaf and may cover the leaf by the end of summer. Powdery mildew on some azalea cultivars may look like subtle leaf spots that are not white and fuzzy. This symptom is more typical on evergreen Rhododendrons.


","

1) Reduce relative humidity by adjusting irrigation practices and spacing plants for good air circulation.

2) Avoid planting in heavily-shaded areas.

3) Use a minimal level of nitrogen fertility.

Two common genetic traits increase the bacteria's ability to cause disease. Most produce a powerful plant toxin, syringomycin, which destroys plant tissues as bacteria multiply in a wound. Bacteria also produce a protein that acts as an ice nucleus, increasing frost wounds that bacteria easily colonize and expand.

Barberry ,(Berberis spp.)-Rusts,"Several rust fungi are reported to occur on barberry including Cumminsiella mirabilissima, which is autoecious (can complete their life cycle on this one host), Puccinia brachypodii var. arrhenatheri with several grasses as alternate hosts, P. koeleriae, with Koeleria cristata as the alternate host, P. graminis, with wheat, barley and rye (stem rust or black stem rust) as alternate hosts, and P. striiformis, with wheat and barley (stripe rust or yellow rust) as alternate hosts. Although P. striiformis f. sp. tritici can infect common barberry, weather conditions in eastern areas are unfavorable for its development.
These rusts are usually minor problems on the widely cultivated ornamental Japanese barberry (Berberis thunbergii). The greatest concern is for development of stem and stripe rust on common barberry (B. vulgaris), which is not sold or produced commercially due to quarantine restrictions for black stem rust in several states. Shipments of susceptible or infected nursery stock have been rejected by some states; however, the movement of stem rust-resistant cultivars is not regulated.
Infection of barberry or Oregon grape by Puccinia spp. takes place in the spring from wind-blown basidiospores produced on the grass stubble of alternate hosts. Basidiospores generally do not travel very far (less than half a mile) so local sources are important. Pycnia (spermogonia) form on the upper surfaces of young leaves and fruit and are followed by showy, yellow-orange aecia that develop on lower leaf surfaces and fruit. Spores from the aecia are wind-blown and infect nearby grass hosts; they are not able to reinfect barberry or Oregon grape.
Barberries planted around old homesteads in eastern Washington and eastern Oregon have been associated with outbreaks of stem rust on wheat. A federal Barberry eradication program to eradicate common barberry in eastern Washington began in the 1940s and continued through the 1970s. Although the program was focused in Washington, some survey and eradication efforts also occurred in Oregon and Idaho. The program was very successful in eliminating over 200,000 barberry bushes; however, it was incomplete and some plants have grown back. Removal of barberry plants near wheat fields is still recommended to reduce stem rust.


","The aecial stage of Puccinia graminis and P. striiformis occur on leaves and fruit. On leaves, aecia appear as bright yellow-orange spots on the upper leaf surface with horn-like appendages on the lower surface. On fruit, the orange-colored aecia may occur anywhere. Aecia may extend up to 5 mm above the leaf or fruit surface. Some authors have described the disease as bright orange spotting. Pycnia are small and barely visible with the naked eye as dark-colored specks that occur in red areas on leaves. Leaf tissue near pycnia and aecia is generally discolored yellow-red. Severe infections can cause defoliation.


","

1) Avoid using overhead irrigation.

2) Remove infected leaves when found.

3) Do not grow alternate hosts next to nursery stock.

4) Produce only resistant cultivars or species. Production and shipment of common barberry is regulated by the USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection service (7CFR 301.38). Only barberry cultivars resistant to , of which there are many, can be imported into Oregon (OAR 603-052-0800) and Washington (WAC 16-472).

Barley ,(Hordeum vulgare)-Barley Stripe,"The fungus, Pyrenophora graminea (asexual stage: Drechslera graminea), survives exclusively on or in seed but is not in all seed lots. Infected seeds can appear healthy. Soil temperature and moisture level during germination and emergence are important in determining whether infected seeds result in seedling infection. Infection is enhanced by intermediate moisture levels and temperatures below 60°F. If moisture is high during heading, conidia may be produced on infected seedlings.


","Yellow striping is visible on second, third, or older leaves. Stripes turn brown, and infected leaves die as the disease progresses. Infected leaves may look frayed as they die.

",,
Barley ,(Hordeum vulgare)-Barley Yellow Dwarf,"Barley yellow dwarf virus (BYDV) is present in many cultivated and wild grasses, which may or may not show symptoms of infection. Many grassy species in non-managed grasslands present in the Pacific Northwest are susceptible to BYDV, including: Achnatherum lettermanii, A. occidentale, A. thurberianum, Alopecurus pratensis, Bromus inermis, Danthonia intermedia, Elymus elymoides, Poa bulbosa, P. fendleriana, P. secunda, Sporobolus airoides, and S. cryptandrus. Field and sweet corn can be symptomless reservoirs of the virus. There are virus strains; based on the aphid species vectoring the disease. One strain (RPV) is now known as Cereal yellow dwarf virus. A number of aphid species can vector Barley yellow dwarf, including the English grain aphid, bird cherry-oat aphid, corn leaf aphid, English grain aphid, and green bug aphid. Disease is more severe in cool, moist weather.


","Symptoms can be variable and may be confused with nutrient deficiencies or stress. Early symptoms of fall infection of barley may first appear in spring as yellowish leaf tips. Oats tend to have reddish leaf tips. Affected leaves may have yellowish, uneven blotches on leaves. Later, blotches may become reddish or purplish. Tissues next to midribs retain their green color longer than the rest of the leaf. The youngest leaves may not have an unusual color.
Damage may not be severe, depending on growth stage at infection, virulence of the viral strain, susceptibility of the cultivar, temperature, and light intensity. Severely affected plants may be stunted and may not head.

Barley ,(Hordeum vulgare)-Rhizoctonia Root Rot (Bare Patch),"Two fungi, Rhizoctonia solani and R. oryzae, that survive in soil and crop residues. Various factors favor this disease including heavy straw residues on or near the soil surface during fallow years; no-till cropping systems; and annual cropping of small grains.


","Stunted plants often are within rows of plants that look normal. Stunted plants also may be in distinct patches. Maturity is delayed in stunted plants. Roots rot and become severed in the top 4 inches. Symptoms on seedlings usually include a dark brown root terminus that tapers to a fine point 2 to 3 inches from the crown or seed, representing the upper half of the lesion that severed the root. Plants whose crown roots are all rotted are anchored only by the subcrown internode, and they may either fall over or ""blow"" out of the soil as late as after heading. Severe disease may occur where soils have high concentrations of these pathogens; seedlings can die out in large patches across a field.


","

1) Disturb the soil with a rod-weeder or cultivator several days or more before seeding.

2) If a preplant tillage is not planned, delay planting at least 21 days after applying a broad-spectrum herbicide to kill weeds and volunteer plants. This is especially important for spring-seeded barley.

3) Rotations to fallow help reduce the severity of disease.

Barley ,(Hordeum vulgare)-Sharp Eyespot,"The soilborne fungus, Rhizoctonia cerealis, can infect barley, wheat, and rye. It overwinters as sclerotia in soil or debris as well as persists as mycelium in litter. Long rotations in susceptible grasses can increase pathogen to severe levels. Cool, moist conditions at the plant's base favor infection. Well-drained soils enhance subsequent pathogen growth and disease development. Later, sclerotia develop, perpetuating the pathogen population.


","Light brown to straw-color, elliptical (lens shape) to round lesions develop on the leaf sheath. Lesions may be up to a half-inch long and are surrounded by a dark brown, sharply delineated border. A characteristic hole is left when affected tissues rot away. Lesions resemble those of eyespot (see Wheat-Eyespot) but sharp eyespot lesions are more clearly delineated, develop later, and are found higher up on the plant, around 1 foot above ground, compared to lesions produced by eyespot (also known as strawbreaker foot rot). Whitish mycelium is often present beneath the culm lesion and this is where whitish to dark-brown, irregularly-shaped sclerotia develop during the summer. White heads (premature ripening) and lodging are apparent when disease is severe.

Wet winters with mild temperatures or abundant snow cover favor pathogen survival. The disease begins from a very small number of infections that are difficult to detect in the field. Spread of the pathogen can be explosive and cause significant losses, especially in the Pacific Northwest where cool, wet weather greatly favors disease development.


","Linear, orange-yellow pustules appear on leaves and/or heads at any growth state after infection. Pustules coalesce to form long stripes between leaf veins. In advanced stages, entire leaf blades of susceptible cultivars may be covered with pustules. The black spore stage develops as linear black pustules covered by the leaf epidermis.


","

1) Use resistant varieties. The winter barleys 'Kold' and 'Strider' are resistant, and 'Hundred' may show somewhat reduced infection. Using cultivar mixtures or multilines may slow the rate of epidemic buildup. Spring barleys with some resistant are available: 'Crest' and 'Orca' are two-row feed barley cultivars developed by OSU; 'Tango' is a nondormant six-row; and 'Sara' is a six-row. 'Baronesse' has intermediate resistance and excellent yield potential. OSU has released the winterhooded barley 'Verdant' (a malting variety), which has some resistance.

2) Plant winter varieties as late as possible and spring varieties as early as possible to help reduce the number of initial infections.

","Scout barley regularly for rust, looking at lower leaves first. If conditions are cool and wet, inspect one more time, just before flag emergence.
Use seed treatment in areas where barley stripe rust was detected the previous year, disease is expected to develop when plants are small, or when growing susceptible cultivars.


Apply fungicides if stripe rust severity is greater than 5% at the late tillering stage. Scout fields weekly from mid-tillering to flag leaf emergence.

Basil downy mildew was found in many states, including California, during 2009 and by 2011, it was discovered in Oregon. It can be a problem in both field- and greenhouse-grown basil crops, as well as in home gardens. Downy mildew is promoted by leaf wetness as well as high relative humidity, but can develop under a wide temperature range.

"Basil, Sweet ",(Ocimum basilicum)-Fusarium Wilt and Crown Rot,"The fungus, Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. basilica, causes a wilt of basil in many regions of the world, including the Willamette Valley of Oregon. This soilborne fungus can persist for years in soil or plant debris. The disease is spread by air or soil and can be seedborne.


","Affected plants' leaves grow asymmetrically, are yellowish, malformed, and may curl. Plants wilt, starting from the abnormal leaves, leading to plant death. Young plants die rapidly, in 4 to 7 days after symptoms are first evident. There is vascular browning and it is more notable in the affected shoot area. A pinkish orange layer of mold may cover stems. Rot of the roots and crown has been observed in Israel but it is typical for roots to appear healthy when wilting is evident.

"Bean, All ",(Phaseolus vulgaris)-Bean Common Mosaic,"Bean common mosaic virus (BCMV) is transmitted by both seed and aphids. The virus occurs wherever beans are grown and many strains of the virus exist. Some cultivars are resistant to several strains of BCMV but no commercially available cultivar is resistant to all strains.


","Infection by BCMV causes a light and dark green mottle or mosaic pattern on leaves, which may also exhibit a downward curling or cupping and general malformation. The mosaic symptom may be associated with and follows the network of leaf veins, which become slightly darker than the interveinal area (""vein banding""). Another symptom of infection is veinal necrosis or ""road mapping"" of leaves. Systemic necrosis (black root reaction), characterized by black vascular tissue in stems and pods, and plant death may occur in some cultivars with a specific type of resistance gene (the dominant I gene) to BCMV. Plants from BCMV-infected seed or plants infected very early in the season are dwarfed and spindly, and yield often is reduced. Infection also can result in deformed pods or pods that show brown discoloration in wall and suture.


","

1) Use virus-tested seed.

2) Plant resistant varieties such as Oregon 91G, Oregon 54, Roma II, BB 110, and Goldrush. Most commercial dry bean varieties and many snap bean varieties are resistant to one or more strains of BCMV but can be susceptible to other, less common strains.

"Bean, All ",(Phaseolus vulgaris)-Bean Yellow Mosaic,"The Bean yellow mosaic virus (BYMV) is transmitted by aphid but not by seed. The disease is fairly widespread. The virus persists in crop and wild host plants including sweet clover, crimson clover, red clover, and gladioli.


","BYMV typically causes a yellow and green mottling; bright yellow spots may be present. Stunting may be severe or mild, depending on the virus strain. Some cultivars may exhibit veinal necrosis. Leaves often are brittle, glossy, and cupped downward and may be malformed. Beet curly top virus (BCTV) symptoms of leaf curling and chlorosis may be confused with similar symptoms caused by BYMV infection. However, leaf curling and cupping due to BCTV infection generally affects younger leaves more severely, whereas with BYMV, the older leaves are more severely affected. Infection by BYMV also can deform pods; they may exhibit a light mottle, and their surfaces may be rough and shiny.


","

1) A few resistant varieties have been developed.

2) Avoid planting beans near sweet clover, crimson clover, red clover, or gladioli because the disease may be transmitted from them to the beans.

"Bean, All ",(Phaseolus vulgaris)-Common Bacterial Blight (Common Blight),"Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. phaseoli (syn. = X. campestris pv. phaseoli), a bacterium that overwinters in contaminated seed, infested crop debris, and is present in and on weeds. The pathogen can be found on the leaves of many plants, but only causes disease on bean. Rain, irrigation water, tools, equipment, and humans can spread the pathogen. Infection occurs when bacterial cells are deposited onto leaves by splashing water, aerosols, or from contaminated seed, and then multiply to form large populations. The bacteria gain entry into plants through natural openings and wounds. Infection occurs most readily during warm (greater than 85ºF), wet weather, especially by hard, wind-driven rains. Bacteria are disseminated within and among fields by splashing water, aerosols, and on contaminated equipment and workers. The pathogen can attack all types of bean, but some kidney bean varieties (Sacramento light red kidney) are especially susceptible.


","Disease symptoms first appear as flaccid, small water-soaked spots on the underside of leaflets. These spots enlarge and merge, becoming dried and brown. A narrow, bright lemon-yellow border of tissue encircles the lesion. Infected pods develop circular water-soaked spots, and yellow masses of bacteria may appear at their center. Later, the spots dry and become reddish-brown, sunken lesions. Early pod infection causes shriveled seeds, and the bacteria may cause yellow to orange discoloration under the seed coat of infected seeds. A stem girdling or joint rot occurs above the cotyledonary node of plants grown from infected seeds. The disease may reduce seed yield, size, and quality.
Visually inspecting seed to detect contamination is unreliable because seeds may appear healthy but be heavily contaminated. Severely diseased seeds may be shriveled or discolored.


","

1) Plant certified seed free from the pathogen.

2) If pathogen-free seed cannot be obtained, delay planting until dry weather prevails, if possible.

3) Avoid frequent irrigations with sprinklers.

"Bean, All ",(Phaseolus vulgaris)-Curly Top,"Beet curly top virus (BCTV) is spread by the beet leafhopper. Other crop hosts include sugar beet, watermelon, tomato, annual flowers, and cucurbit. The disease is cyclic but occurs frequently in the Columbia Basin, southern Idaho, and central Oregon. The virus overwinters in wild perennial or winter annual hosts and is not seedborne.


","Symptoms range widely depending on cultivar sensitivity, growth stage of host, temperature, and virus strain. The predominant symptom is stunting. On young plants, the trifoliolate leaves pucker and curl down. General yellowing and death follow. Older affected plants become yellowed, dwarfed, and bunchy, and pods are stunted. Beet curly top symptoms of leaf curling and chlorosis may be confused with similar symptoms caused by Bean yellow mosaic virus (BYMV) infection. However, leaf curling and cupping due to BCTV infection generally affect younger leaves more severely; BYMV more severely affects older leaves are. All leaves become thicker than normal and, being very brittle, break off easily at the stem. Infected plants yield few or no pods.


","Use resistant varieties. In general, varieties in the pinto, pink, and small-red market classes are resistant. Navy, black, and great Northern varieties range from moderately resistant to moderately susceptible.
Resistant snap bean varieties include Canyon, Yakima, Idaho Bountiful, Idachief, Idelite, and Wondergreen.

"Bean, All ",(Phaseolus vulgaris)-Damping-off and Stem Rot,"Pythium spp., Rhizoctonia solani, and Fusarium spp., possibly other pathogens can cause a seed rot and seedling blight known as damping-off. These soilborne fungi or fungus-like microorganisms can persist indefinitely in soil or plant debris. Rhizoctonia can be transmitted on seed. Damping-off is favored by wet soils.


","Seeds may rot prior to germination (""seed decay""), or the seedling may become infected prior to emergence (""pre-emergence damping-off"") or soon after emergence (""post-emergence damping-off""). In the latter cases, the stem of the seedling becomes infected and tissues become discolored and soft, resulting in the seedling toppling over after it has emerged from the ground. Stem infections occurring late in the seedling stage may cause a canker or ""wire stem"" symptom in which the plant doesn't die, but it is stunted, unthrifty, and may produce adventitious roots. Infections may be mild if only feeder roots are attacked.


","

1) Plant seed in warm (over 55°F), moist soil after frost danger has passed.

2) Tillage practices that decrease plant residues on the soil surface may result in less disease.

"Bean, All ",(Phaseolus vulgaris)-Halo Blight,"Pseudomonas syringae pv. phaseolicola, a bacterium that overwinters primarily in seed but can survive in infected, undecomposed plant debris from the previous year's crop. Rain, irrigation water, tools, equipment, and humans can spread the bacterium. The frequent wet weather in Oregon's Willamette Valley in June favors the development and spread of halo blight. Even under arid conditions of the intermountain west, the disease may spread in rill-irrigated and sprinkler-irrigated fields. Most bush beans, including limas, are susceptible to the disease, but 'OSU 91G' has moderate resistance. 'Blue Lake' pole beans are not resistant but seldom become diseased when field grown.


","The first symptom is water-soaked spots followed by irregular brown spots, usually with yellow halos around them. A bacterial sheen often covers the surface of the spot. Defoliation occurs in severe infections. Leaves on systemically infected plants may show yellowing and malformation without the appearance of necrotic symptoms and infected plants often are stunted.
On the pods, dark, greasy-looking, water-soaked spots appear, often with a bacterial ooze on the surface. The suture often appears dark and water-soaked, too. Spots extend through the pod. Later, spots become dry and brown.
On stems, reddish waxy cankers develop, often girdling and killing plants.
Visually inspecting seed to detect contamination is unreliable because seeds may appear healthy but be heavily contaminated. Severely diseased seeds may be shriveled or discolored.

P. pachyrhizi is considered aggressive on soybean and also infects kudzu (Pueraria lobata). It is considered a minor problem on common bean in Africa, Asia, Australia, and Central and South America. Disease increases on leaf surfaces during prolonged periods of wet weather and temperatures ranging from 59°F to 86°F. Plant debris contained in seed may harbor the rust fungus and enable spread of the pathogen. This disease has not been reported in the Pacific Northwest but P. pachyrhizi was detected on soybean in the southeastern part of the United States during 2004. Another soybean rust pathogen (P. meibomia), which causes American soybean rust is present in South America and the Caribbean, but does not pose a risk to common bean.


","Lesions start as small gray spots on the underside of leaf surfaces, turning tan, reddish brown, or purple. Leaf chlorosis may appear on the upper leaf surface. Lesions are angular due to restriction by leaf veins. Lesions often appear first on older leaves but they also may appear on petioles, stems, and pods.

"Bean, Dry ",(Phaseolus vulgaris)-Damping-off,,,,,
"Bean, Dry ",(Phaseolus vulgaris)-Pythium Diseases (Pythium Blight),"Pythium debaryanum and P. ultimum are fungus-like microorganisms that persist indefinitely in soil or plant debris. Favored by wet soils, they increase when vegetable and legume crops are planted too frequently in the rotation.


","In the intermountain west, the disease appears when bean plants are in the pre-bloom stage and continues to affect plants for 2 to 3 weeks thereafter. The stem and lateral branches develop a rot that extends from the soil line to several inches above it. The stem cortex initially becomes soft and slimy and turns dry, shrunken, and tan after a few days. Infected plants usually wilt and die quickly. However, some infected plants may survive into the pod-filling stage. Those plants have a white fungal growth near the soil line extending an inch or two up the stem. The rotted portion of the stem and lateral branches is light brown and shrunken in dead plants. The lack of sclerotia and the occurrence of the disease well before row closure helps distinguish Pythium wilt from white mold.


",,,
"Bean, Dry ",(Phaseolus vulgaris)-White Mold (Sclerotinia Rot),"The fungus, Sclerotinia sclerotiorum, causes white mold. It overwinters as small black structures (sclerotia) in soil. Sclerotia may survive 5 to 8 years in the soil. After a conditioning period of several weeks at 40°F in moist soil, sclerotia can germinate in moist soil when temperatures are 59°F to 65°F and produce a small, stalked, cup-shaped fruiting structure (apothecium; plural: apothecia), which releases millions of spores into the air. Sporulating apothecia can persist 5 to 10 days. Spores are forcibly ejected and a few may be blown up to a mile but most land nearby. Spores can survive 2 weeks. Under moist conditions, spores may infect senescent tissue such as blossoms and leaves or may germinate and colonize plant debris. After colonizing blossoms or senescing leaves, the fungus can invade any healthy part of the plant it contacts. Moist conditions within the plant canopy favor infection. Rain, dew, and/or irrigation practices that keep foliage wet for long periods favor white mold development.
Other host plants in addition to bean include pea, lettuce, carrot, cabbage, parsnip, potato, sunflower, radish, other crucifers, and cucurbits. Dandelion (Taraxacum officinale) is a very susceptible weed host.


","The first symptom is usually water-soaked lesions on stem and pods. The fungus may invade the stem near the soil line, causing a rapid wilting and death of the entire plant, or it may invade pods or branches and foliage come in contact with colonized tissue. When dry, lesions on infected stems and pods are beige to white due to the production of acetic acid by the fungus. They frequently have sclerotia embedded in them both internally and on external surfaces. In addition, infected stem surfaces may be papery where the epidermis separated from underlying tissue. Newly forming sclerotia are white and change to black after several days.
The beige to white lesion on infected stems and the white mold growth and sclerotia on plant parts help distinguish this disease from Pythium blight, with which white mold may be confused.
Sometimes, the presence of white mold in a field may occur as fine cottony wisps of fungal mycelium growing on plant debris on moist soil. However, many other fungi also can colonize debris, so that is not a useful diagnostic character.


","

1) Plant varieties that do not produce a heavy vine or are more erect and upright. Bush or semivine types allow better air circulation between rows, thus permitting better drying of the soil surface and plant canopy and providing unfavorable environmental conditions for the white mold fungus.

2) Do not overirrigate. After pods start to form, allow soil surface to dry out before irrigating again. If white mold is abundant in early August, no additional irrigations are advised. Research in south-central Idaho indicates a final irrigation about four (4) weeks prior to undercutting reduces disease significantly.

3) Space plants for good aeration between and within rows and orient to the prevailing wind if the placement of irrigation equipment allows.

4) Apply adequate nitrogen for crop needs, but not apply excessive fertilizer that leads to dense, lush plant growth that is favorable for white mold.

5) When white mold is present, extend the interval between irrigations to allow plants and the soil to dry.

6) Plowing deeply to bury sclerotia may be beneficial once the pathogen is in a field, but plowing the field in later years may return viable sclerotia to the surface where they can produce apothecia.

7) Practice crop rotation by growing nonsusceptible crops (onions, grasses, cereals) for 8 to 9 years, before planting susceptible crops (bean, lettuce, potato, crucifers, celery, etc.).

","Fungicides are recommended if the bean field has a history of white mold and if rows are expected to close by early bloom. One (1) application of fungicide when all plants have one open blossom significantly reduces disease. For southern Idaho growers, a single application of Topsin M applied when 100% of the plants have their first open blossom generally provides effective control through harvest.
Fungicides may be applied by ground sprayers equipped with drop nozzles that apply the fungicide to the lower, interior parts of the plants. Some materials can be applied through sprinkle irrigation. Aerial application for white mold control generally has not given satisfactory results and is not recommended. Applications after the disease is widespread in the field will not satisfactorily control the disease.

"Bean, Snap ",(Phaseolus vulgaris)-Bacterial Brown Spot,"Bacterial brown spot is caused by the bacterium, Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae, which can overwinter on bean and several leguminous weed species. It can also contaminate seed, but the role of such inoculum in disease development is not well understood. Sprinkler irrigation and leaf rubbing can spread the disease. Data from the University of Wisconsin indicate that disease development correlates with the intensity of water droplet impacts on leaves. The disease usually is more of a problem in lima beans than in snap green beans. This disease was a problem in Idaho in 1995-97, primarily in sprinkler-irrigated fields, but has not been detected there the past several years. It is not a serious problem in Oregon's Willamette Valley but is a problem in Midwestern bean-producing areas where it overwinters on vetch. Strains of P. syringae that cause diseases of fruit crops will not cause brown spot on beans.


","Small round to oval, brownish red spots, often with a yellow halo, develop on leaves. Lesions may fall out, giving a shothole appearance. Under most conditions there is a little water soaking in the leaf. When the pathogen infects systemically, stems may have lesions. Lesions on pods are small, brownish red, oval spots preceded by small water-soaked spots. Pods may be twisted or bent from lesions.

"Bean, Snap ",(Phaseolus vulgaris)-Clover Yellow Vein,"Clover yellow vein virus (CYVV) is transmitted by the green peach aphid, pea aphid, black bean aphid, and clover aphid. Two or three subspecies of Trifolium repens (white clover) are the principal virus reservoirs in western Oregon. Clover yellow vein virus and strains of Bean yellow mosaic virus often are in the same field.


","First, the terminal leaf rolls down and turns brownish. Following terminal death, stem and leaf tissues die from the terminal down. Within 4 to 7 days, the upper part or the entire plant may turn dark brown and die.


","

1) Use resistant varieties if available.

2) Where feasible, eradicate white clover cultivars from border or pasture areas near fields used for bean production. Instead, grow red clover, alsike clover, other hardy clovers, birdsfoot trefoil, or other agronomically suitable legume species.

3) If white clover eradication is not feasible, select fields for bean production that are at least 100 yards from white clover stands. This small degree of isolation will substantially reduce losses from the bean necrosis disease.

4) When possible, locate bean fields upwind (toward the prevailing summer breeze) from clover fields or pastures containing clover. This further minimizes infection due to aphid flights from clover to beans.

5) Avoid planting beans in fields that contained white clover cultivars the previous year.

","Insecticides to control black bean aphid or other species in June and July may be beneficial. Sprays should include field border areas containing numerous white clover plants. See the PNW Insect Management Handbook for details.

"Bean, Snap ",(Phaseolus vulgaris)-Damping-off,,,,,
"Bean, Snap ",(Phaseolus vulgaris)-Fusarium Root Rot,"The fungus, Fusarium solani f. sp. phaseoli, can survive in soil for many years. It persists on infected bean straw and spreads when the straw is moved. Wind and water can move infested soil and debris. The disease is favored by extremes in soil moisture (too dry or too wet) and is less severe when moisture is near field capacity. Anything, which impedes root growth such as cold or compacted soils also favors the disease.


","The main root may show a red discoloration, later turning brown and decaying. Infections seldom spread into tissues above ground level. Small side roots die and, above them, secondary roots develop, which may become infected and die. These secondary roots help maintain the plant and help the crop develop when the tap root is severely diseased. In severe cases, plants are stunted; leaves are yellowish and often drop early.


","

1) Plant in well-drained soil when possible.

2) Avoid compacted soils or minimize soil compaction with deep ripping to avoid hard pans.

3) Rotate into grass or small grain crops between bean crops, 5 to 6 years is better but 3 to 4 year rotations are more common.

4) Till 18 inches below the row just before planting. Root rot is not decreased, but better root formation offsets the disease's effect on the plant. This treatment is especially effective on heavy soils or in soils that have a plow pan.

5) Hilling vines is helpful because it promotes adventitious root production.

6) Use resistant or tolerant varieties if available.

"Bean, Snap ",(Phaseolus vulgaris)-Gray Mold,"The fungus, Botrytis cinerea (teleomorph: Botryotinia fuckeliana), is an opportunistic pathogen that easily invades weak, damaged, or senescing tissue. All aboveground portions of the bean plant can be attacked but often disease starts on senescing flowers or cotyledons. Flower infections are important for subsequent spread to leaves and pods. Spores (conidia) are produced throughout the growing season under a wide range of temperatures and humidity and stem infections are a durable inoculum source, producing conidia throughout bloom. Cool temperatures (68°F is optimal but the fungus can grow between 50F° and 80°F), high humidity, and free water on plant surfaces favor the disease, as do close plant spacing and irrigation practices that keep plants wet for a longer time. Durable sclerotia overwinter in soil. Gray mold is more severe when beans follow beans. Gray mold occurs in southern Idaho at trace levels, unlike in the Willamette Valley of Oregon where it causes significant losses.


","The initial symptom is a dark, water-soaked, slimy lesion, with concentric zonation and sometimes a yellowish margin. Long brown streaks form on stems and petioles. As tissues dry out, gray, powdery spore masses form. Black sclerotia may also develop.


","

1) Rotate out of beans to cereals and corn for at least 2 years.

2) If the placement of irrigation equipment allows, orientating the bean rows in the direction of prevailing winds helps control gray mold as well as white mold.

3) Limit irrigation during and after bloom. Irrigate in the morning so plants do not stay wet more than 12 hours. In some areas, growers may be able to irrigate heavily before bloom and as little as possible thereafter.

"Bean, Snap ",(Phaseolus vulgaris)-White Mold (Sclerotinia Rot),"The fungus, Sclerotinia sclerotiorum, causes white mold. It overwinters as small black structures (sclerotia) in soil. Sclerotia may survive 5 to 8 years in the soil. After a conditioning period of several weeks at 40°F in moist soil, sclerotia can germinate in moist soil when temperatures are 59°F to 65°F and produce a small, stalked, cup-shaped fruiting structure (apothecium; plural: apothecia), which releases millions of spores into the air. Sporulating apothecia can persist 5 to 10 days. Spores are forcibly ejected and a few may be blown up to a mile but most land nearby. Spores can survive 2 weeks. Under moist conditions, spores may infect senescent tissue such as blossoms and leaves or may germinate and colonize plant debris. After colonizing blossoms or senescing leaves, the fungus can invade any healthy part of the plant it contacts. Moist conditions within the plant canopy favor infection. Rain, dew, and/or irrigation practices that keep foliage wet for long periods favor white mold development.
Most other plants are susceptible, including pea, lettuce, carrot, cabbage, parsnip, potato, sunflower, radish, other crucifers, and cucurbits. Dandelion (Taraxacum officinale) is a very susceptible weed host.


","The first symptom is usually water-soaked lesions on stem and pods. The fungus may invade the stem near the soil line, causing a rapid wilting and death of the entire plant, or it may invade pods or branches and foliage that comes in contact with colonized tissue. When dry, lesions on infected stems and pods are beige to white due to the production of acetic acid by the fungus. They frequently have sclerotia embedded in them both internally and on external surfaces. In addition, infected stem surfaces may be papery where the epidermis separated from underlying tissue. Newly forming sclerotia are white and change to black after several days.
The beige to white lesion on infected stems and the white mold growth and sclerotia on plant parts help distinguish this disease from Pythium blight, with which white mold may be confused.
Sometimes, the presence of white mold in a field may occur as fine cottony wisps of fungal mycelium growing on plant debris on moist soil. However, many other fungi also can colonize debris, so that is not a useful diagnostic character.


","

1) Reduce humidity and high-moisture periods within the plant canopy and field.

1.1) Provide adequate aeration within, and especially between, rows by increasing plant and row spacing. This is not always economically feasible. 
1.2) If available and suitable in quality, plant varieties which are more erect and upright or that do not produce excessive foliage near the ground level (open-base types). 
1.3) Orientating the bean rows in the direction of prevailing winds is useful for white mold control if the placement of irrigation equipment allows row orientation.
1.4) Time irrigations to allow drying of plant canopy before night fall.
1.5) Avoid excessive irrigation after petal fall
1.6) Apply sufficient nitrogen to meet crop demands, but avoid excessive fertilization that can lead to dense, lush plant growth.
2) To reduce pathogen population within a field:

2.1) Rotate with non-hosts for 8 years to achieve best control, but for at least 2 years to reduce population of sclerotia; grasses, cereals, and onion are not affected by white mold.
2.2) Deep plowing buries sclerotia but plowing later years may return viable sclerotia to the surface.
2.3) Field flooding during warm temperatures destroys sclerotia. 
3) A timely harvest with rapid cooling and pod storage at 45°F to 50°F will provide an effective postharvest control.

","In fields with a history of white mold, apply fungicide at 1% to 10% bloom (that is, 1 to 10% of the plants in the field have at least one open bloom). A second application may be necessary with highly susceptible cultivars or heavy disease pressure.

"Beet, Red ",(Beta vulgaris)-Beet Curly Top,"Beet curly top virus is spread in North American only by the beet leafhopper (Circulifer tenellus). The virus has an extensive host range. The leafhopper breeds readily on mustards and overwinters in perennial or winter annual weed hosts, carrying the virus to beets and other crops in spring.


","Young leaves roll in, pucker, develop blister-like thickenings, and are dwarfed. Vein clearing appears in young leaves followed by vein swellings on the lower sides, which appear knotted or gall-like. Roots are dwarfed, and rootlets may be twisted and distorted. Tap roots are covered with many rootlets (""hairy root""). Young plants die quickly.


","

1) Early seeding is advised.

2) Sow seed thickly to escape the disease.

3) Rogue infected plants.

",,
"Beet, Red ",(Beta vulgaris)-Beet Mosaic,"Beet mosaic virus (BMV) overwinters in infected members of the beet family (including sugar beets). The virus is spread by many aphid species but persists in the aphid vectors for only a few hours. Therefore, the virus moves fairly short distances from infected plants. The host range for BMV includes the families Chenopodiaceae, Solanaceae, Leguminosae, and others.


","Young leaves have yellowish circular spots, often yellowish rings with green centers. Leaves appear puckered and mottled with light and dark green areas. Plants are stunted.

","Young leaves show no symptoms at first. Vein yellowing or vein clearing is seen early in younger leaves. Leaves turn chlorotic, notably thickened, leathery, and brittle. Reddish spots appear between leaf veins, grow larger, and often merge. The leaves may have a distinct bronze cast. Infected plants often turn reddish or purplish, or the normal reddish or purplish color intensifies. Finally, about the time seeds are maturing, the plant is in general decline. Affected seed plants have poor root growth and are easily uprooted by a moderate wind. Their seed is smaller and has less vitality than seed from uninfected plants.

"Beet, Red ",(Beta vulgaris)-Cercospora Leaf Spot,"Cercospora beticola, a fungus perpetuated in beet refuse. It can be spread on seed produced in regions where the disease is severe. It is not a major disease in the Pacific Northwest but occasionally causes serious leaf spot. Other hosts include sugar beet, mangel, spinach, and Swiss chard. No resistant cultivars of table beet are known.
The disease is favored by high humidity or free moisture and high temperatures (77°F to 95°F). Under humid conditions, conidia form on infected crop residues and are carried by wind or rain to host leaves.


","Numerous small circular spots about 0.12 inch in diameter appear on leaves. These have definite margins, often deeper in color (dark brown to reddish purple) than surrounding tissue. Centers turn brown and later gray as spores are produced. Petioles also are affected. When spots are numerous, the entire leaf tends to wither and die prematurely, reducing root growth and yield.


","

1) Plant at least 100 yd from last season's plantings.

"Beet, Red ",(Beta vulgaris)-Damping-off,"The soilborne fungi or fungus-like microorganisms, Pythium spp. and Rhizoctonia solani, attack before, during, and after germination. In Oregon, Pythium spp. are the major cause of pre- and post-emergence damping-off of young beet seedlings and are favored by cool soil temperatures. Rhizoctonia solani is more often associated with post-emergence damping-off of older seedlings and is favored by warmer soil temperatures. Aphanomyces cochlioides causes post-emergence damping-off and is favored by wet soils and temperatures between 68°F and 86°F. These microorganisms can survive several years in soil and can infect other plant species including beans, other legumes, and some weed species.


","Seedlings either do not emerge or emerged seedlings' stems often blacken and wilt. Very few infected seedlings survive.


","

1) Encourage rapid emergence by managing planting depth (shallow), timing, and soil moisture. Work soil at moisture conditions that reduce soil compaction.

2) Rotate beet crops with grass and grain.

3) Placing phosphate fertilizer in a band 1 inch below seed often prevents damping-off.

"Beet, Red ",(Beta vulgaris)-Downy Mildew,"The fungus-like microorganism, Peronospora farinosa (= P. betae = P. schachtii), causes disease mostly west of the Cascade Range. In the Willamette Valley of Oregon, susceptible cultivars often are a total loss. The microorganism survives in infected crop residues and in wild or volunteer Beta spp.; the downy mildew on lambsquarters does not affect beet. Peronospora farinosa also can survive in seed to a limited extent. Optimal temperatures for infection are 45°F to 59°F; little infection occurs above 68°F.


","All aboveground plant parts may be affected and young leaves are especially sensitive, from where the pathogen grows into the crown. Large, light green leaf spots develop on the upper leaf surfaces. Under moist conditions, a white to gray mold appears on the lower or upper leaf surfaces. Affected leaves may wilt, and then die. If environmental conditions become unfavorable for downy mildew, plants may show recovery by developing healthy leaves, or other pathogens may be encouraged. During fall wet periods, most young petioles or leaves are covered with a fungal growth that often moves into the crown. Crown infection causes excessive leaf proliferation, which in turn causes misshapen bulbs. Crown infections may permit other root-decay organisms to invade the plant.
In beet seed crops, systemic crown infections of stecklings may result in severe stand and seed yield losses. Flower and seed heads can be attacked directly with serious losses of seed production.

P. betae = Phoma betae) can cause leaf spots and root rot of table beet, sugar beet, Swiss chard, and other Beta species. The fungus is seedborne. During the spring time, windblown ascospores are released from sexual fruiting bodies (pseudothecia), which developed the previous season on infected plant debris remaining on the soil surface. Asexual fruiting bodies known as pycnidia develop in the center of leaf spots as well as in lesions on petioles, stems, and storage roots. Pycnidiospores (conidia) produced by pycnidia can be moved by water splash, or equipment, tools, or workers moving through infected fields when wet. Temperatures between 57°F and 65°F with high humidity are optimum for disease. Rains close to harvest in infected seed fields will increase the occurrence of infected seeds.


","Infected seed result in damping-off or seedling blight symptoms. Leaf spots appear as light-brown lesions that may contain concentric rings of small, dark pycnidia. Wilting and dark-brown-to-black spots/rot of the root tissue develop upon infection of the storage root. Rot can also develop on beets in storage. Infected seed crops may develop grayish lesions or dark streaks on stems that can result in stem breakage; pedicels can also be infected.


","Practices that promote vigorous growth of the plant will minimize the disease in table beets.

"Beet, Red ",(Beta vulgaris)-Rhizoctonia Root Rot (Pocket Rot),"Rhizoctonia solani is a fungus that has a broad host range and survives primarily as mycelium or sclerotia in plant debris. Rhizoctonia solani becomes active when soil is 77°F to 91°F, attacking any part of the plant in contact with soil. The fungus is favored by poor soil structure and high soil moisture. Infections can move plant-to-plant, creating diseased ""pockets"" in a field.


","Black lesions are present on the crown and lower petioles. Severely infected fleshy roots may have large regions of dry rot, dark brown to black in color.


","The most effective management is to promote good crop growth and avoid plant stress.

1) Do not plant beet crops consecutively. A 3-year rotation is the minimum; lengthen to 4 to 5 years if root rot is a problem. Shortened rotations in affected fields are associated with increased losses and a build-up of pathogen populations that make future control more difficult.

2) Practice a 3-year rotation with non-host crops (grains).

3) Control soil compaction.

Begonia,Impatiens Necrotic Spot,,"The type of symptoms observed and the intensity of symptom expression will vary depending on the age of the begonia plant when infected and environmental conditions. Plants infected at an early age may be stunted and unthrifty, and flowers of these plants are of poor quality. Plants infected when older may produce normal looking flowers, but foliar symptoms will be present. Rings or zoned spots develop on the leaves of some cultivars or under some conditions. A bright green/dark green chlorotic mottle may be present. Darkened or necrotic veins may occur on undersides of leaves. Brown patches may develop at the petiole end of a leaf.

Begonia,Leaf Spot,"Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. begoniae, a bacterium. Can survive in dead leaves at least 1 year and is favored by splashing water, overhead irrigation, and temperatures from 80°F to 90°F. The bacteria can enter injured roots or leaves. They can also be spread through recycled irrigation water. Different species and hybrids show different susceptibility. Rieger begonias can become systemically infected. The common bedding plant Begonia semperflorens has low susceptibility while the hardy begonia (B. grandis) develops spots and marginal scorch symptoms.


","Water-soaked circular lesions surrounded by yellow halos develop on leaves. Leaf spots are small and somewhat transparent. They enlarge and run together, causing a blotched appearance. Bacteria ooze from the infection, then dry and turn light brown. Symptoms can vary depending on the cultivar. Spots or blotches may be V-shaped, confined between major veins, or small, round, and purple. Leaves fall early and, in severe cases, stems are invaded and the entire plant wilts and dies. Systemically infected Rieger begonias wilt and die.

Nematode infections are transferred to other areas and from one season to the next in planting stock or in desiccated plant parts. Foliar nematodes need a film of water to move across plant surfaces. They can enter leaves through stomata or wounds. Plant-to-plant spread in field or greenhouse occurs when plants are close together. Splashing water can move nematodes from one plant to another. Spread can be rapid even when low-volume irrigation spray stakes are used. Foliar nematodes generally are in the plant's buds and leaves but may be in the flowers, seeds and soil as well. The life cycle can be completed in 2 weeks under optimum conditions.


","Leaves may turn pale green, then yellow and later brown. The brown tissue may drop out leaving a shothole appearance. Leaf blights are often angular and bounded by larger veins. Leaf blighting may be most prevalent in mid to late summer. New growth may become curled, stunted and twisted. Secondary infections by Botrytis may also occur.

There are few other records of this disease and is considered rare since the use of soilless media. The fungus is soilborne and survives in soil indefinitely. The fungus enters plant roots, invades the xylem system of the stem, and cuts off the water supply. Toxins are also produced, which, along with xylem occlusion, result in wilt symptoms.


","Lower leaves lose color, gradually turn yellow, and wilt. Later these symptoms may appear on upper leaves. Occasionally, affected plants die.

Bellflower ,(Campanula spp.)-Rust,"Coleosporium tussilaginis and Puccinia campanulae are rust fungi that are obligate biotrophs, requiring a living host on which to survive and reproduce. They do not kill their hosts but through severe infections can reduce growth and cause leaf drop, decreasing the cosmetic value of bellflower plantings. Coleosporium campanulae requires Bellflower (urediniospores and teliospores) and pine (Pinus spp., pycniospores and aceiospores) to complete its life cycle. Urediniospores are capable of secondary infection of uninfected plants and plant parts and can be disseminated by wind and rain over short to relatively long distances. Puccinia campanulae only requires Bellflower in order to survive and reproduce, with teliospores serving as the resting structure and basidiospores spreading the infection. Coleosporum campanulae has been reported in British Columbia and observed in Oregon while Puccinia campanulae has been reported in Oregon and Washington. Mild, moist conditions are most conducive to rust infection due to the spores' requirement of free water on the leaf in order for infection to take place.


","The first symptom generally observed is chlorotic leaf spots followed by the development of numerous orange-to-reddish-spore masses (pustules) on the underside of leaves. Pustules can also form on the top of leaves and stems. Pustules are made of plant cells that have ruptured due to excessive sub-epidermal production of urediniospores or teliospores. Teliospores produced by P. campanulae will usually appear more reddish-brown in color. Teliospores can be distinguished from urediniospores via light microscopy by their darker color and division into two cells by a septum.

Berckmann's Arborvitae ,(Platycladus orientalis)-Berckmann's Blight,"Seimatosporium berckmansii (formerly Coryneum berckmansii), a fungus. The fungus produces spores in late September, which are washed and splashed by rains to infect new foliage within the plant. These small spores are also easily carried by insects or by air currents to other shrubs. This is a foliage disease confined to the imbricated or bract-like leaves and small twigs where the fungus overwinters. Large woody stems are not attacked, but infected plants eventually die because of continued defoliation.
Berckmann's arborvitae-Platycladus orientalis L. var. conspicua 'Berckmannsii'-is particularly susceptible to infection. Most cultivars of P. orientalis, including the golden arborvitae and several green forms of globular or pyramidal habits, are susceptible to the disease as well. American and European species seem to be immune. Pyramidal arborvitae (Thuja occidentalis 'Pyramidalis') is not generally susceptible, though the WSU-Puyallup Plant Clinic found one exception.


","Infections begin in young, tender foliage at branch tips and develop downward. Color changes from the normal green to a grayish cast. As the fungus moves down small branchlets to larger ones, some of the latter become girdled; foliage beyond these injuries then changes from the normal green to a reddish brown. This brown discoloration is especially conspicuous above zones where branches are girdled. Eventually much of the infected foliage falls and exposes unsightly masses of gray stems. Tiny black fruiting bodies (acervuli) of the causal fungus may be found on infected gray foliage, especially where branchlets are girdled.

Birch ,(Betula spp.)-Wood Decay,"Two types of wood decay occur in living trees: white rots and brown rots. The more common fungal white rots in birch are caused by Ganoderma applanatus, Fomes fomentarius, and Phellinus igniarus. White rots cause all major structural components of the cell wall-cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin-to degrade. The strength of white rotted wood decreases only in advanced stages of decay. Infection occurs through branch stubs and wounds. Conks usually develop in these same areas.
The more common fungal brown rots in birch are caused by Piptoporus betulinus (brown cubical rot) and Stereum ostrea (brown crumbly rot).  Brown rots cause most of the cell wall polysaccharides to degrade, but the lignin component is unchanged or slightly modified. The strength of brown rotted wood is significantly reduced or lost entirely shortly after decay begins. These rots usually are in exposed wood and can cause extensive damage, resulting in structural failure.
Injuries from pruning cuts, sunburn, or storm damage can expose susceptible wood. Large wounds and stubs, and horizontal cuts are often entry sites for decay fungi. Wood decay generally is observed in older trees after extensive fungal colonization. Decay fungi frequently function as secondary invaders following a succession of microorganisms, including bacteria, yeasts, and other fungi. Decay in a single tree may be caused by more than one fungal species.


","White rots cause moist, soft, or spongy wood that is a lighter color than sound wood. Fine black lines may run throughout the decayed area. The conks of Fomes fomentarius are perennial and hoof shaped. The upper surface is smooth, gray to grayish brown, and concentrically zoned. The under surface is brown with small circular pores. The interior of the conk is dark brown and the tubes (pores) appear extremely long; annual layers not being conspicuous as in many other perennial conks. The tubes are often encrusted with white material. The conks of Phellinus igniarus are also hard, woody, and usually hoof shaped. The upper surface of young conks is grayish black and smooth, but with age this surface becomes rough and cracked.
Brown rots of wood are brown, dry, and crumbly, with longitudinal and transverse cracks. These rots usually are in exposed wood and can cause extensive damage, resulting in structural failure. For Piptoporus betulinus the decayed wood is yellowish-brown and usually cracked, with thin white sheets composed of fungus mycelium in the cracks. The wood is light in weight and powders easily under pressure. The conks are annual, corky, and either shelf or hoof shaped. The upper surface is smooth and gray. The outer margin curves inward toward the under surface. The lower surface is yellowish-white when fresh, becoming brown with age and is composed of small pores. The pore layer breaks away easily from the rest of the conk. The annual fruiting bodies of Stereum ostrea are thin, leathery, shelf-like brackets, one above another. The upper surface is buff colored, but becomes gray with age. The under surface is light brown and smooth.
Each of these wood decays leads to limb breakage and/or uprooted trees during wind or ice storms. Many trees have decreased vigor and dieback.


","

1) Avoid wounding trees to prevent decay. For example, mowing equipment should not injure the roots, crown, or lower trunk.

2) Make pruning cuts adjacent to, but not into, the supporting branch, and prune when branches are small to enhance callus formation and wound healing.

3) Irrigation water, especially from sprinklers, should not wet the trunks.

4) Inspect trees for decay and/or conks to assess tree stability.

5) Remove affected trees to avoid damage to surrounding property or spread to other trees.

Blackberry ,(Rubus spp.)-Anthracnose,"Elsinoe necator, a fungus that overwinters on infected canes. Blackberry-raspberry hybrids such as 'Boysenberry' and 'Loganberry' are not often infected. The disease is not always severe enough to warrant the cost of spraying. This disease is particularly serious if rains continue late into spring, when spots on canes may be plentiful enough to retard sap flow, thus girdling the canes. Early-season infections are more severe than late-season infections.


","Small purple spots appear on canes, increase in size, and develop light-gray centers with brownish-purple borders. Spots commonly coalesce to form large irregular lesions. Numerous lesions may girdle the cane causing it to dry and crack. On leaves, minute purple spots develop, which enlarge and coalesce to form gray to white areas. Such areas may drop out. Partial defoliation may result. Berries may ripen prematurely and be small and dry.


","

1) Plant certified disease-free stock.

2) Prune off old cane stubs after planting.

3) Prune off old canes close to the ground as soon after harvest as possible, and destroy by burning. Best done before rains resume in the fall.

Blackberry ,(Rubus spp.)-Armillaria Root Rot,"Armillaria mellea, a fungus, infects blackberry roots, killing the cambium and decaying the underlying xylem. This is a soilborne fungus that is capable of attacking many different plant hosts. These fungi are most commonly found in forests and natural areas where they infect a variety of trees and shrubs. Therefore, the disease is most common in newly established blackberry fields that are planted on land recently cleared of native vegetation.
This fungus may form mushrooms at the base of infected canes in fall and winter. Mushrooms produce wind-blown spores, but these spores are not a significant means of infecting healthy blackberries. The fungus spreads vegetatively, below ground, which leads to the formation of groups of dead and dying plants called ""disease centers."" The fungus can survive on woody host roots long after the host dies. Its vegetative fungal tissue (mycelium) decomposes root wood for nutrients as it grows. When infected plants are removed, infected roots that remain below ground serve as a source of inoculum for blackberries planted in the same location.
Infection occurs when blackberry roots come in direct contact with partially decayed tree roots and are colonized by mycelium. Infection can also occur when blackberry roots contact rhizomorphs (black, shoestring-like fungal structures) that grow out from partially decayed roots and through the soil. Once blackberry roots and crowns are infected, whether they are living or dead, they serve as a source of inoculum for neighboring blackberries. Fresh sawdust mulch may also contain the pathogen.


","The first visible disease symptom is a decline and dieback in which leaves turn yellow, wilt, and die. This may occur only on one side of the plant or in one or two canes. Symptomatic plants generally occur in patches in the field. Diagnostic mycelial fans can be observed beneath the bark of the root crown of infected plants. Dig down about a foot below the soil line and use a pocketknife to remove thin layers of bark from the root collar. Mycelial fans are thick, white layers of fungus that adhere to the root bark and/or the wood beneath the bark. Armillaria also makes black, shoestring-like structures called rhizomorphs, which are occasionally found within the bark and/or extending into surrounding soil. Rhizomorphs may look like roots on the outside but have an entirely different structure when cut open in cross-section. Occasionally, in fall, yellowish-brown or honey-colored mushrooms may appear around the bases of infected plants.


","

1) When clearing a new site of forest trees and shrubs or when clearing a site with infected plants (infection centers) there are several precautions to take.

1.1) Girdle large trees before removal to hasten decay of roots.
1.2) After removing aboveground vegetation, clear soil of stumps and large roots. Deep-rip the soil in more than one direction to bring large roots to the soil surface. If possible, remove all roots greater than 1 inch in diameter from the soil.
1.3) Burn all woody debris.
1.4) Leave this ground fallow at least 1 to 4 years.
2) Trenches lined with plastic sheeting may help if inoculum is from an adjacent stand.

3) If using drip irrigation, move drip-line emitters away from the crown and in between blackberries after first year of planting.

4) Remove severely infected plants and destroy them, being careful to remove small roots from the soil. If practical, do not replant where infected plants have been removed.

Blackberry ,(Rubus spp.)-Blackberry Rust,"Phragmidium violaceum, a macrocyclic, autoecious (can complete their life cycle on this one host) rust fungus that is a problem on cultivated Evergreen and wild Himalayan blackberries. Although other cultivars of blackberry can be infected, none appear as susceptible as evergreen blackberry, which can result in significant crop loss. Among wild Himalayan blackberries there appears to be a range of sensitivity with some clones highly susceptible while other nearby plants seem unaffected. Rubus armeniacus is one of the most common invasive species in western areas but unfortunately is not highly susceptible to this rust. Although the disease was first recorded in 2005, growers and ranchers of western Oregon observed this problem in 2004. The rust has been found in all West Coast States. In British Columbia the disease has not been observed in the full range of its host. As of 2008, the rust was found in localized infections on coastal east central Vancouver Island and on the southwest lower mainland.
The fungus overwinters as telia principally on leaves that remain attached to canes and/or those trapped in cane bundles. Teliospores germinate in the spring and produce basidiospores that can infect leaves of primocanes and floricanes. These primary infections produce aecia, which produce aeciospores, which also infect leaves. These infections produce uredinia, which produce urediniospores that infect the flower buds and leaves and stems of the primocanes and floricanes. New uredinia are produced from these infections and continue the epidemic, building up disease in rapid, successive cycles. Black pustules (telia) develop among the uredinia in the late summer/early fall on infected leaves. Old floral canes can be a significant source of spores for fall infection of primocanes in the Pacific Northwest. Wet conditions (> 6 hours of leaf wetness) with mean daily temperatures between 49°F and 64°F favor disease development. Spores are easily spread by the wind; young leaves at three-quarters expansion are most susceptible to infection.


","Foliar symptoms include circular purplish leaf spots with yellow to tan centers on the upper leaf surface accompanied by cream to yellowish-orange pustules (aecia and uredinia) on the lower leaf surface. The upper leaf symptoms may resemble Septoria leaf spot while the lower leaf symptoms may resemble cane and leaf rust. Yellowish-orange pustules may also form on the flower buds, fruit and canes of infected plants. Cane infections on evergreen blackberries are rare even when leaf infection is severe. Severely infected leaves may curl and dehydrate. Severely infected flowers and fruit fail to ripen. Continuous defoliation as well as stem infections by the pathogen may cause dieback of the canes. Black pustules (telia) develop among the uredinia in the late summer/early fall on infected leaves.


","Cultural tactics and dormant season lime sulfur will help reduce initial inoculum sources while chemical tactics will focus on protection of young, healthy plant tissues. Field renovation practices that destroy previously diseased plant parts may contribute to the effectiveness of a chemical control program the following spring.

1) Remove old fruiting canes right after harvest. If removal cannot be scheduled right after harvest then cut old floral canes as early as possible to prevent development of more spores.

2) Remove and burn old fruiting canes as soon after harvest as possible, cutting flush with the ground. Cultivate as soon as weather permits.

3) Strip leaves from primocanes before tying.

4) In home gardens, destroy fallen leaves and other refuse.

","Chemical protection needs to start with applications of lime sulfur targeted to infected leaves remaining on canes or trapped in cane bundles. The rust reactivates in fall, and consequently, a fungicide application near mid-September may be beneficial to plant health. Overuse of any single product may encourage the development of fungal resistance. All of these fungicides are primarily protectants and cannot eradicate the disease after it has become established.


1) Apply delayed-dormant lime sulfur spray to trellised canes. Wait until the first buds produce about 0.75 inches of new growth (this is typically in late March to early April).

1.1) Rex Lime Sulfur Solution (28%) at 8 to 10 gal/100 gal water and apply 150 to 200 gal/A. 48-hr reentry. O
1.2) Sulforix at 3 gal/100 gal water. 48-hr reentry.
2) Apply to both fruiting and primocanes in the spring about 4 weeks after the delayed dormant spray. Spray again if the rust becomes active during the growing season. Alternate fungicide materials from different chemical groups. Research indicates that Rally (Group 3 fungicide) is better than Group 11 fungicides.

Blackberry ,(Rubus spp.)-Cane and Leaf Rust,"Kuehneola uredinis, a fungus that affects 'Black Diamond', 'Chehalem' and 'Evergreen' blackberries. Rust can be particularly severe on 'Chehalem'. This fungus forms several spore types, which can infect leaves of floricanes and primocanes. The fungus is not systemic in the plant. Wet conditions favor disease development.


","Elongate, yellow pustules (uredinia) form on floricanes in late spring. Canes become brittle and break easily. Spores from these lesions infect leaves and produce small, yellow pustules (uredinia) on the undersides of leaves. Without a good comparison one might describe the color as orangish. Premature defoliation can occur if severe. Buff-colored pustules (telia) develop among the uredinia on leaves in fall. These produce other spores, which infect leaves on primocanes, which develop pustules, called spermagonia and aecia. Pustules may also be seen on fruit. Might be confused with orange rust, which has bright-orange uredinia or with blackberry rust.

Blackberry ,(Rubus spp.)-Cane Blight,,,,,
Blackberry ,(Rubus spp.)-Crown and Cane Gall,"Agrobacterium tumefaciens and A. rubi are the two bacterial pathogens associated with crown gall on blackberry.  The bacteria may come into a planting with infected plants or persist in soil as a result of previously infected plants. Once present in a field they can survive for years in the soil as saprophytes. They are spread by splashing rain, irrigation water, pruning tools, wind, insects, farm machinery, and on contaminated propagation material (cuttings, grafting stock). Caneberry host plants include blackberries, black-, red-, purple-, or yellow-raspberries, 'Boysenberry', 'Loganberry', and 'Youngberry'. The cultivar Chester is very susceptible.
Infection is through cane or root crown injuries. Injuries such as lateral root formation, leaf scars, or winter injury can occur naturally. Mechanical injuries, such as those from pruning, training, and harvesting, favor the disease. Cane gall can occur from splits in the cane from bending and training the cane. After the bacterium enters a wound, a small piece of its DNA is transferred into the plant's DNA. The foreign DNA transforms normal plant cells in the wounded area into tumor cells. Once transformed, tumor cells proliferate automatically. The result is a gall, a disorganized mass of hyperplastic and hypertrophic tissue.
The critical time to protect against crown gall is the first year after planting. Experimentally initiated infections during the first growing season after planting resulted in severe weakening or death of the plants.


","Crown gall appears on fruiting canes as small rough ridges or elongated overgrowths of granular gall tissue. Galls frequently cause canes to split open. Crown gall infections also may develop as irregular warty galls at the canes' base or on roots. Small galls are easily confused with tissue overgrowths caused by excessive callus formation at wound sites, particularly in the process of rooting stem cuttings. Symptoms may not develop for over a year if infection occurs when temperatures are below 59°F. Although galls blacken and may die over the winter, new galls may erupt the following spring near the old galls.


","

1) Use certified nursery stock from fields where gall has not been found.

2) Inspect planting stock and do not plant new canes that show galls on canes, crowns, or roots.

3) If only a few plants are infected, remove them from the field and destroy them.

4) Establish new plantings on uninfested land wherever possible.

5) Prune canes only during dry weather and frequently disinfect pruning equipment.

6) Use care when harvesting and training, so not to injure canes.

7) Preplant soil solarization has been effective for cherry nursery stock in western Oregon and may have some value for home or organic production. Place clear plastic (preferably anti-condensation film) directly on smooth, rototilled ground, which has been irrigated to field capacity, and then allowed to drain for 1-2 days. Bury the edges of the plastic to trap the heat. Solarize for 4-6 weeks (or longer) during the hottest part of the summer, beginning in early- to mid-July.

",,"Dipping the roots and crown area of blackberry plants in commercial preparations of the bacterium A. radiobacter K84 or strain K1026 before planting provided good protection for at least the first year, thus helping the plants to become well established. Follow manufacturer's directions. To be effective it must be applied a few hours after wounding. Change solution frequently, because if a set of plants contaminated with other pathogens is dipped, then all succeeding plants dipped into the same container/solution will become contaminated.

Blackberry ,(Rubus spp.)-Downy Mildew,"Peronospora rubi and/or Peronospora sparsa, (the former has been reported from the PNW) a fungus-like organism that infects many caneberries (Rubus spp.), especially blackberry and 'Boysenberry'.The disease is not common on red raspberry. The blackberry cultivars Black Butte and Loch Ness are susceptible. It overwinters primarily as a systemic infection of canes, crowns, roots, and buds. The disease cycle starts each spring with the production of infected shoots from infected root, crown, and cane buds. Unfolding leaves are invaded during warm, wet conditions. Secondary infections of flowers and developing berries during wet, warm weather are initiated from flowering to harvest primarily by conidia produced on diseased shoots. Weather parameters that are associated with increased disease include months where the temperature is between 59°F and 68°F for 10 or more hours and months when it rains more than 11 days. Diseased berries then become an important source of inoculum for new cycles of berry infection. After harvest, infection of developing primocanes lying on the ground continues by internal mycelial growth and spore infection. Propagation of systemically infected nursery stock is another way fields can become severely infected.
Cross inoculations with isolates from either rose or Rubus sp. show they can infect the other host.


","In summer to autumn, small, conspicuous, irregularly shaped patches appear on upper leaf surfaces, starting near the petiole then following leaf veins. Patches are yellow initially, becoming a deep wine red with a brownish edge and brownish discoloration near and alongside veins. Red streaking on stems and petioles indicate systemic infection. The organism attacks fruits, sepals, and pedicels of 'Boysenberry', causing fruit to become dry and shrivelled (dry cell syndrome). Berries also may split and appear to be two berries on one pedicel. The dry-berry mite and sunburn can also cause a dry berry condition.


","

1) Use certified nursery stock free of the pathogen.

2) Practice early primocane control through chemical burning.

3) Reduce or eliminate overhead irrigation.

4) Practice good weed control.

5) Eliminate other hosts, such as wild blackberries and roses, close to fields.

Blackberry ,(Rubus spp.)-Dry Cell (Dry Berry) Syndrome,"Unknown. Many fungi have been associated with dry druplets found on various blackberries in the Pacific Northwest. Many of these are common pathogens that produce other, more recognizable symptoms. The list includes those fungi that cause anthracnose, ascospora dieback, spur blight, cane and leaf rust, and Botrytis fruit rot. Other fungi of unknown pathogenicity also have been found. In general, the dry druplets have not been found to be associated with downy mildew, sunburn, or pests such as the dry-berry mite. Symptoms most often are found in years when late spring rains are numerous and frequent. Berries with these symptoms are not accepted into the more lucrative individual quick-freeze (IQF) markets. The problem has been widely found in 'Marion' and 'Kotata' with minor amounts in 'Boysenberry'. It has been a problem in both alternate-year and every-year fields.


","Individual druplets become shrivelled, dry and hard. In addition, some fruits may have small dry, scabby looking lesions on green, red, and black druplets. Affected druplets may be widely scattered on the berry or may be clustered in patches anywhere on the berry. Symptoms are seen anywhere from early berry development to ripening. Sporulation of various fungi may or may not be seen.

Blackberry ,(Rubus spp.)-Fruit Rot,"A survey in 2015 found the majority of isolates to be Botrytis cinerea, a fungus. This fungus is ubiquitous and attacks many different fruit and ornamental crops. A moist, humid environment is ideal for sporulation and spread of this fungus. Wet weather just before and during bloom is important for disease development. All flower parts are very susceptible. Initial infections of flowers may be latent, such that the fungus is dormant until fruit ripens. Airborne spore concentrations rise and remain elevated during and after harvest.
Fruit rot may be more prevalent in fields under overhead set irrigation systems or where fruit overripens in the field for mechanical harvest. Fruit rot is more common in the 'Evergreen' cultivar. Good air drainage between plants and between rows is important to rapidly dry fruits and foliage after rain or irrigation.


","Rotted fruit, usually develops a gray fungal growth on the surface. Rotten fruit may mummify and stay attached to the receptacle. The fungus may attack senescent leaves and cause cane infections. Small, black, overwintering structures (sclerotia) may develop on any infected plant part.


","No single cultural practice provides adequate management of gray mold under highly conducive conditions. Integrate several tactics to manage this disease. The use of cultural tactics reduces reliance on fungicide applications and can help manage fungicide resistance.

1) Space plantings to provide good air drainage and drying conditions.

2) Adjust irrigation so plants do not stay wet for extended periods of time. Switch from overhead to drip/trickle irrigation.

3) Pick fruit at correct stage of maturity; do not allow it to overripen. Reduce the interval between mechanical harvests.

4) Pick into shallow containers that will be sold to customers.

5) Move harvested fruit to cold storage as soon as possible.

","Apply the first spray at 10% bloom, then at regular intervals through bloom. Another spray just before harvest may be needed if rainy weather is expected. Alternate or tank-mix materials from different groups with different modes of action for each application. Limit the use of any one group during the growing season. Strains resistant to many different modes of action have been reported from throughout the world including the Pacific Northwest.

Records at OSU's Mycological Herbarium and Plant Clinic indicate that ""orange rust"" was found from 1913 to 1923 in Douglas, Hood River, Umatilla, Union, and Wasco Counties of Oregon. In 1997, G. nitens was found on 'Kotata' blackberries in an isolated field in the Willamette Valley of Oregon. The field was removed a few years later. It has also been reported from California. These fungi are systemic in an infected plant.
Two forms of the fungus have been described. One form is predominant on black raspberries, forms telia, and is referred to as a long-cycle form (and associated with the name Arthuriomyces peckianus). Aeciospores that develop in the spring from this form do not develop systemic infections but produce telia. Infections from teliospores that are produced in the fall will eventually develop into systemic infections. The other form is predominant on blackberries and dewberries, does not produce telia, and is referred to as a short-cycle form (and associated with the name Gymnoconia nitens). Aeciospores that develop in the spring from this form do develop systemic infections. The only way to tell the difference between the two forms of this fungus is to germinate the aeciospores on water agar.


","Many weak, spindly shoots arise from infected roots and crowns in spring. Infected shoots may lack prickles. Some primocanes and floricanes may look healthy later in the season, but floricanes never produce flowers due to systemic infection. In spring, unfolding leaves can be stunted, misshapen, and pale green to yellow. Lower leaf surfaces become covered with blister-like pustules (aecia). Aecia are waxy at first, then turn a powdery bright, almost fluorescent orange. Infected black raspberry leaves may wilt and drop off or may develop brownish black pustules (telia) on the lower leaf surface. Might be confused with cane and leaf rust, which has dull, more yellowish pustules, or with blackberry rust.

1) Scout for the disease during summer.

2) Quickly remove and destroy infected plants.

3) Establish new plantings from a clean source or from tissue-cultured plants.

","None will cure existing infection as they only prevent new infections. Herbicides can be used as a spot treatment to kill infected plants.

Blackberry ,(Rubus spp.)-Powdery Mildew,"Podosphaera macularis (formerly Sphaerotheca macularis) , a fungus. Powdery mildew causes fruit loss in some Pacific Northwest plantings each year. 'Boysenberry' is very susceptible while 'Loganberry' is less susceptible; however, most other blackberries and their hybrids are generally not affected by this disease.
Powdery mildew also attacks 'Munger' black raspberry, 'Himalaya', and some other blackberries. The 'Puyallup' red raspberry is very susceptible, so powdery mildew may be a limiting factor with that cultivar. 'Canby', 'Fairview', 'Haida"", 'Skeena', 'Wakefield', and 'Washington' are sometimes infected. 'Amity', 'Cascade Bounty', 'Chilcotin', 'Heritage, 'Rudi, 'Sumner', and 'Willamette' are resistant.


","Whitish-gray, powdery growth on foliage and fruit. Infection on the lower surface of a leaf may cause the upper surface to look mottled or blotchy with light-green areas. Severe mildew retards, dwarfs, and distorts plant parts and makes fruit unsalable. Young fruits fail to size properly, wither, and die.


","

1) Do not plant close to wooded areas that might shade the field.

2) Remove wild blackberries from around the field.

3) Plant more-resistant cultivars.

4) Remove any infected primocanes that occur late in the season.

5) Create an open plant canopy to improve air circulation and increase light penetration.

Blackberry ,(Rubus spp.)-Purple Blotch,"Septocyta ruborum, a fungus similar to the one that causes septoria leaf spot. Field observations in Oregon have shown 'Marion', 'Evergreen', 'Kotata', and 'Waldo' blackberries are affected. Symptoms will not develop unless a chilling requirement is met. Spores are produced in spring on symptomatic floricanes and infect only primocanes. Conidia are rain dispersed and  collect near the base of tricomes before infection. Stomata are the primary infection court; however, deep wounds or cuts are also infected. Experimentally, spores do not seem to infect stems if only the epidermis is scraped away.


","Dark green, irregularly shaped lesions appear on canes late in the growing season. During winter and spring, lesions become purple with a red margin. Affected areas 0.5 to 2 inches long develop into cankers and girdle canes. Severely affected canes die in spring. Lesions become paler-brown in late spring and small, black, fruiting structures (pycnidia) develop in the lesion's center. Leaf spots do not develop.


","

2) The disease has not been a problem in alternate-year (AY) fields when canes are trained up as they grow. If canes are allowed to lie on the ground, the disease can be just as severe as in fields where berries are harvested annually.

3) Remove old fruiting canes after harvest.

4) Trellis canes in August or early September or in late spring. Canes trained after early September may be more susceptible to winter injury. Wait until February or March. Evergreens are more winter-hardy and usually can be trained safely through the winter.

Blackberry ,(Rubus spp.)-Septoria Leaf Spot,"Sphaerulina westendorpii (formerly Septoria rubi), a fungus that affects trailing berries such as 'Marion' and 'Santiam' blackberries, 'Boysenberry', and 'Loganberry'. Minute, black, fruiting bodies (pycnidia) are formed within infected tissue, mature, and produce spores. Rain spreads spores. In winter, the sexual spore stage forms on old dead leaves and on infected canes. During the wet early spring, more spores are produced, and these cause many new infections.


","Leaf spots vary from light to dark brown. At first they are about 0.12 inch in diameter and purplish in color. They later turn brown. In older leaf spots, centers are whitish with brown to red borders. Small black dots (pycnidia) may occur near the center of the lesions. Infections on canes are similar to those on leaves but are generally inconspicuous. During wet seasons in Oregon, a brown fruit rot has been found on 'Loganberry'. Blackberry rust may look similar on the upper surface of a leaf but has yellowish pustules in the same location on the underside of that leaf.

Blackberry ,(Rubus spp.)-Spur Blight,,,,,
Blackberry ,(Rubus spp.)-Stamen Blight,"Hapalosphaeria deformans, a fungus. This disease affects 'Boysenberry', 'Youngberry', 'Marion', 'Evergreen', and wild trailing blackberry. It also has been described on raspberries in Europe. The disease is severe in some plantings; severity varies markedly from year to year. Rain splashes spores from infected flowers to axillary buds of primocanes during bloom. The infection process is not well understood but occurs in summer.


","Stamens of infected flowers are flattened against the petals instead of in an upright ring. Anthers are swollen, brown, and do not shed pollen. Since sporulation occurs before the flower opens, the flower has a white, powdery appearance when open. Flowers may have symptoms on sepals: leaf-like structures at the tips and double the number of petals. Some species of blackberry may show a witches' broom of the inflorescences. If fruit develops, the receptacle is constricted, and a number of druplets either fail to develop or do so unevenly. Ripening may be uneven, and fruit is hard and difficult to remove from the receptacle.


","

1) The alternate-year fruiting system controls the disease by removing the inoculum source from above developing primocanes.

2) Use plant spacing and canopy management that promotes good air circulation.

","Direct sprays onto primocanes in the every-year fruiting system any time between flowering and harvest.

Blackberry ,(Rubus spp.)-Verticillium Wilt,,,,,
Blackberry ,(Rubus spp.)-Virus Diseases,"Many viruses have been found in blackberries in the Pacific Northwest. Blackberry calico virus (a carlavirus) is universally present in older commercial 'Thornless Loganberry' fields. Despite no know vector (other than grafting or vegetative propagation of infected plants) the disease spreads rapidly in the field. Similar calico diseases occur in field-run 'Marion', 'Chehalem', 'Olallie', and 'Waldo' blackberries. Other virus diseases known to infect blackberries in the Pacific Northwest include Strawberry necrotic shock virus, (SNSV) an ilarvirus transmitted by unknown means, and Raspberry bushy dwarf virus (RBDV), which infects pollen and is therefore transmitted by insect pollenators. RBDV was found in 4 of 32 fields surveyed in 2000. SNSV is transmitted by thrips in strawberry and there is some evidence it can be transmitted by thrips to Rubus spp. since there can be low levels of transmission in plants that are not flowering. Strawberry necrotic shock virus and Raspberry bushy dwarf virus can be detected serologically.
Other viruses, of lower importance, that can infect blackberry include Apple mosaic virus.  There are at least 12 additional viruses that are common in the Southeastern US in blackberry. Each of those viruses is symptomless in single infections, so laboratory testing must be carried out to ensure that these viruses are not introduced into the PNW.


","Usually no definite symptoms are observed. Symptoms are quite variable depending on cultivar and virus combination. Degree of crumbliness or druplet abortion can range from severe to very mild. Yellow line patterns are common on plants infected with Blackberry calico virus (almost as if painted on with a fine brush) and general chlorosis in plants of 'Marion' blackberry infected with Raspberry bushy dwarf virus (as if painted on with a sprayer). Strawberry necrotic shock virus (usually symptomless alone) or Blackberry calico virus cause minor impacts on fruit yield and quality. Raspberry bushy dwarf virus in 'Marion' causes bright yellowing of the leaves on primocanes and a bleaching of leaves on fruiting canes in July and August. Chlorosis has not been observed early in the season. A 50% yield reduction and 40% reduction in fruit size and druplet number have been measured. Since the receptacle stays with the fruit, the crumby berry symptom is not observed. No reduction in cane diameter or length was observed. RBDV in mixed infections with BRNV and/or Blackberry calico virus can cause drupelet abortion and misshapen fruit, though it has been much less of a problem in blackberry than in red raspberry.


","A control program for blackberry viruses must begin with nursery stocks propagated from virus-indexed sources known to be fruitful. Such sources are commercially available.

1) Use certified planting stock.

2) Plant immune or resistant cultivars if available.

3) Plant in large blocks to slow movement of pollenborne viruses into new plants, especially if fields in the immediate area are infected.

4) Test for nematodes before planting and do not plant in soil containing  spp.

Bleeding Heart ,(Dicentra spectabilis)-Viruses,"Both Tobacco ringspot nepovirus and Tobacco rattle virus (TRV) have been reported on this host. TRV was confirmed on the OSU campus but it is unknown how extensively it occurs in the PNW. TRV is a rod-shaped virus with a positive sense ssRNA. Both viruses can be transmitted by nematodes.


","TRV - White line patterns or ringspots are found on many but not all leaves. White areas may cover 5% to 60% of a leaf. Pattern is different from leaf to leaf. Yellowing (chlorosis) or necrotic tissue does not seem to be a symptom. Plants are likely to be less vigorous and may not be as long-lived.

Blueberry ,(Vaccinium corymbosum)-Alternaria Fruit Rot,"Alternaria tenuissima, a fungus.  This disease has caused severe losses in some Oregon fields, although it is not as common as ripe rot. The fungus overwinters as mycelium and spores in old, dried-up berries, dead twigs from the previous season's crop and on other plant debris. Infections can occur any time between late bloom through fruit maturity. Infections remain quiescent (latent) until fruit ripens. The disease often is not seen in the field but develops in storage or in transit to market.


","As fruit ripens, the first symptom is a shriveling or caving-in of the side of the berry. This deformity is generally located near the flower end of the berry. The damaged part may be covered with a blackish or dark greenish mass of spores that gives the surface of the berry a dull cast. Although berries may be dry in the field, the rot can become watery when harvested fruit is stored. Infected berries also tend to break open easily.
Sometimes leaf lesions occur and are circular to irregularly shaped, tan to gray, about 0.25 inch or less in diameter, and surrounded by a reddish brown border. In most cases only lower leaves are affected.

"
Blueberry ,(Vaccinium corymbosum)-Armillaria Root Rot,"Armillaria root rot, also known as shoestring root rot, is caused by a number of Armillaria species, most notably Armillaria mellea and Armillaria gallica. Other newly described species from the Pacific Northwest, such as A. ostoyae, may also be involved, but their pathogenicity on blueberry has not yet been proven. These are soilborne fungi that are capable of attacking many different plant hosts. They are most commonly found in forests and natural areas where they infect a variety of trees and shrubs. Therefore, the disease is most common in newly established blueberry fields that are planted on land recently cleared of native vegetation. The pathogen can also be unintentionally introduced to plantings in infested bark mulch.
The fungus mainly spreads from nearby infected trees and shrubs or from buried, infested woody debris to new blueberry plantings via rhizomorphs. Rhizomorphs are black shoestring-like or cord-like structures resembling roots that grow out from an infected plant into the soil until they encounter the roots of nearby host plant. In this manner, the pathogen can spread from an initial focal point to neighboring plants, thus forming ""disease centers"" within an otherwise healthy field of blueberries. Infection begins when blueberry roots come into contact with mycelia or rhizomorphs of the fungus. The rhizomorphs grow along the surface of the roots and then penetrate inwards where the pathogen kills the cambium and begins decaying the underlying wood. Once a host is infected, the fungus can survive for years by using the large woody roots and basal stems as a food source even after the host plant dies.
Spores from mushroom fruiting bodies could potentially be infectious if they come into contact with recently wounded sapwood, but most new infections occur primarily through contact of healthy blueberry roots with rhizomorphs.


","Initially, infected plants appear slow-growing and stunted. Leaves may be small, chlorotic, and turn red prematurely in late summer to early fall. The entire plant may be affected or only individual canes may exhibit symptoms of the disease. When stems become girdled, leaves turn yellow, wilt, and the plant eventually dies. Young plants may be killed within a few months.
Diagnostic white mycelial fans are produced under the bark near the root crown and on larger roots. Use a sharp knife to remove the bark where thick white mycelia can be observed growing between the innermost bark and the underlying sapwood. Rhizomorphs may also be evident as black shoestrings or cords that grow on the surface of the roots and lower stem extending outwards into the soil.
Yellowish-brown to brown mushrooms occasionally form around infected plants in the fall. The mushrooms grow in clumps and have a distinctive ring around the stalk.


","Maintain good plant health. Plants that experience stress from either too much water or too little are predisposed to infection.

1) When clearing a new site of forest trees and shrubs or when clearing a site with infected plants (infection centers) there are several precautions to take.

1.1) Girdle large trees before removal to hasten decay of roots.
1.2) After removing aboveground vegetation, clear soil of stumps and large roots. Deep-rip the soil in more than one direction to bring large roots to the soil surface. If possible, remove all roots greater than 1-inch in diameter from the soil.
1.3) Burn all woody debris.
1.4) Leave this ground fallow at least 1 year or preferably 3 years.
2) Trenches lined with plastic sheeting may help if inoculum is from an adjacent stand.

3) If using drip irrigation, move drip-line emitters away from the crown and in between bushes after first year of planting.

4) Remove severely infected plants and destroy them, being careful to remove small roots from the soil. If practical, do not replant where infected plants have been removed.

","Soil fumigation can also help reduce inoculum, but it is expensive and the site should be properly prepared to achieve optimal efficacy. Large roots and woody debris greater than 1-inch in diameter must be removed before fumigation occurs because chemical fumigants do not easily penetrate these materials and may leave a viable source of inoculum in the soil. In addition, soil fumigants are effective only to the depth that they are applied in the soil, so any inoculum remaining below the fumigation layer may reinfest the overlying soil once the fumigant has dissipated. Finally, plastic tarps, such as totally impermeable films (TIF) should be applied immediately after fumigation to help retain fumigants in the soil and increase efficacy.

Blueberry ,(Vaccinium corymbosum)-Bacterial Canker,"Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae, a bacterium that multiplies in buds and on expanding aerial plant tissues as an epiphyte during the late fall and into the spring months. The pathogen is rarely isolated from asymptomatic tissues during dry weather but can be isolated from symptomatic, diseased tissues year-round. Additionally, P. syringae has been reported to colonize weeds and grasses. The disease is favored by presence of overwintering inoculum in diseased stems and buds on plants in the field. Disease is also favored by large epiphytic populations of the pathogen on the surface of emerging tissues in the early spring months. Wounded tissues provide entry sites for the pathogen into the plant. Wounds can be caused by pruning, insects, hail, wind, and frost injury. Disease incidence and severity in the spring is often greater following frost injury the previous fall. Many isolates of P. syringae can catalyze the formation of ice crystals at elevated temperatures such as 2°C and lower. It is proposed that frost injury is enhanced by ice-nucleation active P. syringae and wounds caused by freezing allow the pathogen to enter damaged plant cells. Cold weather (temperatures below 10°C) and moisture favor development of the disease.
Bacterial canker can be particularly severe on young plants in new plantings because a high proportion of the wood is succulent and susceptible to disease. The bacteria can be disseminated by wind, rain, or insects or introduced with infested propagation wood or infested nursery stock. Equipment such as pruning tools and mechanical harvesters may carry the pathogen from plant to plant in addition to causing entry wounds.
'Atlantic', 'Burlington', 'Coville', 'Chandler', 'Darrow', 'Draper', 'N15G' ('Eberhardt'), and 'Patriot' are susceptible; 'Elliot', 'Rancocas', and 'Weymouth' seem more resistant. The rabbiteyes 'Ochlockonee', 'Tifblue' and 'Powderblue' are susceptible.


","Only canes produced the previous season are attacked. A water-soaked lesion first appears on canes in January or early February and rapidly becomes a reddish-brown to black canker. Cankers may extend from a fraction of an inch to the entire length of the 1-year-old cane. Buds in cankers are killed. If the stem is not girdled, buds above the canker grow. If girdled, the cane portion above the canker dies. Leaves turn orange and wilt if death occurs after buds have leafed out. The disease also will attack cuttings in propagation beds. Severe Botrytis infection can cause similar symptoms.


","Sanitation measures have been helpful.

1) Plant resistant cultivars.

2) Prune out all diseased wood as soon as it is noticed and especially before fall rains.

3) Avoid late-summer nitrogen fertilizer applications, that can lead to winter injury

4) Prune susceptible cultivars during dry weather if possible.

","Spray twice, first before fall rains, preferably the first week in October, and again 4 weeks later. Several spring applications are recommended in British Columbia, starting at budbreak and using the lower rates of copper. It is not known if spring applications are effective or sustainable in western Oregon or Washington. Multiple applications and/or low rates of chemicals are notorious for encouraging resistance to these products. Bacteria resistant to copper products are widespread and have been found in 75% to 81% of the isolates collected.

Blueberry ,(Vaccinium corymbosum)-Botrytis Blight,"Botrytis cinerea, a fungus that survives as sclerotia (resistant survival structure) and dormant mycelia on dead twigs of bushes and prunings. It also overwinters as a saprophyte on dead organic matter and dead plant parts in or on the soil surface. Many different fruit and ornamental crops (such as blackberry, raspberry, and strawberry) are susceptible to infection and may be sources of spores. A related species Botytis pseudocinerea, has been reported from a low number of rotted fruit in California. This species is naturally resistant to the fungicide fenhixamide.
In spring, these tissues produce vast numbers of spores during wet periods. Spores spread primarily by wind but also by splashing water. Susceptibility is highest during bloom and again near harvest. Cultivars that tend to retain floral structures over a long period are more susceptible. Green fruit can rot when rains continue into the late spring and early summer. Infection is more likely on fruit that retains old floral tissue. Also, branch tips killed by low winter temperatures are easily infected.


","During wet springs, blueberry blossoms take on a brown, water-soaked appearance and die. Blossoms may be covered with dense grayish powdery masses of Botrytis spores. Infections may move through the blossoms rapidly and often destroy the entire floral structure. The disease also can move from blossoms back into fruit-producing wood. On young leaves, pale brown lesions form.
Green fruit rot starts as a brown water-soaked discoloration near the calyx end of the fruit. Brown necrosis spreads such that whole sectors of the berry are involved. The entire berry rots and shrivels, then falls off the cluster. Fruit may also shrivel and be covered with the characteristic gray sporulation after harvest.
Infected succulent twigs are at first brown to black and later bleach to tan or gray. Twigs blight from the tip toward the base. Black sclerotia can be found near the tip of blighted twigs. Symptoms can be seen after winter injury and/or before floral budbreak. The disease is easily confused with bacterial blight and/or the shoot blight stage of mummy berry if there is no sporulation.


","

1) Annually prune to remove infected twigs and to open canopy for good air circulation.

2) Space plants for good air circulation and quick drying.

3) Adjust timing and/or frequency of overhead irrigation to keep aboveground portions of the plant dry. Use drip irrigation.

4) Avoid late-season fertilization.

5) Practice good weed control.

6) Pick fruit at correct stage of maturity and move harvested fruit to cold storage as soon as possible.

","Apply fungicide from prebloom through the end of bloom. A preharvest application is useful to control fruit rot after harvest. Alternate or tank-mix materials from different groups with different modes of action to avoid problems with resistant strains. Minimize the use of any one group during the growing season.

Blueberry ,(Vaccinium corymbosum)-Chemical Injury,"Fruit russeting has been observed with late treatments of chlorothalonil products (Bravo and maybe Echo), Regalia, or triforine (Funginex) at high rates. The russeting can resemble cold injury to fruit. Injury from Bravo is more common when air temperatures are high. The cultivar Bluetta was very susceptible to chemical injury during 2002 disease control trials in western Oregon.


","Fruit develop small, roughened areas after bloom that are reddish-brown. These diffuse areas looked netted and slightly raised. Berries may crack or split close to harvest.

Blueberry ,(Vaccinium corymbosum)-Crown Gall,"The bacteria Agrobacterium tumefaciens has been found in the PNW while A. rubi was reported from Argentina. It is not known if A. rubi, found on caneberries in the PNW, is a problem in blueberry fields in the PNW. Both pathogens survive in soil and infect plants through wounds. Catcher plates on mechanical harvesters can wound canes sufficiently to initiate galls. The disease is a sporadic problem in propagation beds, young plantings, and a few established fields. Some cultivars seem more susceptible than others.


","Knobby galls occur on branches, at the bases of canes, and on major roots. These galls may be scattered in discrete masses on infected roots and branches or they may occur in long linear strips of contiguous bumps. Galls can also completely encircle the branch. Young galls are cream-to-light brown and spongy in texture, whereas mature galls become dark brown-to-black and are rough and hard. Size varies from only an eighth-inch across up to 1.6 - 6 inches in size. Plant tissues underneath the gall are white or green, but necrotic tissue develops between individual galls. Proper diagnosis is essential because small galls can be confused with wound-callus tissue or other galls caused by fungi, insects, and nematodes.


","

1) Purchase clean stock, and inspect new plants before planting. Discard any diseased plants.

2) Do not plant in previously infested fields, or rotate infested field to grasses or vegetables for 2 to 3 years before replanting blueberry.

3) Preplant soil solarization has been helpful in reducing populations of certain soilborne pathogens and weeds in western Oregon. Place clear plastic (preferably anti-condensation film) directly on smooth, rototilled ground, which has been irrigated to field capacity and then allowed to drain for 1-2 days. Bury the edges of the plastic to trap the heat. Solarize for 4-6 weeks (or longer) during the hottest part of the summer, beginning in early- to mid-July.

4) When mechanically harvesting, clean and lubricate berry-catching plates frequently during harvest. Use springs with just enough tension to close the catching plates.

5) Remove and destroy diseased tissue.

6) Prune bushes only during dry weather and frequently disinfect pruning equipment.

","


1) Gallex (ready to use) painted on very young galls to reduce further development. Galls may return the following year or, if treated late, may continue to develop. Tissue surrounding the gall may be injured, especially on younger plants. Prepare the surface by removing soil from around the galled area, and allow the area to dry before application.  24-hr reentry.

","Cuttings or plant roots may be dipped in a suspension of an antagonistic bacterium before planting. To be effective it must be applied a few hours after wounding. Change solution frequently, because if a set of plants contaminated with other pathogens is dipped, then all succeeding plants dipped into the same container/solution will become contaminated.

Blueberry ,(Vaccinium corymbosum)-Fusicoccum Canker (Godronia Canker),"Godronia cassandrae (asexual: Fusicoccum putrefaciens), a fungus. The disease occasionally can interfere seriously with the establishment of new plantings in British Columbia and Washington. It is considered to be the most serious canker disease of blueberry in British Columbia. It is less serious in established fields because only new wood can be infected. However, disease incidence has been increasing in older fields since the late 1980s.
The fungus overwinters in cankers on stems and crowns of infected plants. Conidia account for nearly all infections and disease spread. Conidia are released from pycnidia in wet weather and disperse by splashing rain. Conidia infect stems primarily at leaf scars from March through June. Natural openings in bark also may serve as infection sites. Long cool, wet periods are required for infection. Conidia also are produced and released from August through October but probably account for few infections.


","Infections appear on current-year stems at bud sites or wounded areas as small reddish brown lesions in early spring. As these cankers enlarge, the centers usually become gray and margins turn reddish-brown or dark-brown, giving the canker a bull's-eye appearance. Small, dark pimple-like pycnidia can frequently be found in the canker. Cankers become progressively larger each year and eventually may girdle stems, causing them to wilt and die. Leaves on infected branches may turn color earlier in the fall.


","Sanitation is a critical component of successful management.

1) Purchase healthy certified planting material and/or do not use plants with injured branches.

2) Prune out and destroy cankered branches. Growers with infected prunings can obtain permits from local fire districts to burn prunings.

3) Avoid overhead irrigation.

4) Grow tolerant cultivars. Field observations have found the cultivars Rubel and Rancocas resistant, while Berkeley, Bluecrop, Earliblue, Jersey, and Pemberton are highly susceptible. In British Columbia the cultivars Duke and Liberty have been impacted heavily while being subtler on Bluecrop.

","No fungicide is currently registered for control. Research in British Columbia indicates that broad-spectrum fungicides with multi-site modes of action used for control of other disease are effective. Management of other diseases in the spring may indirectly be controlling this disease.

Blueberry ,(Vaccinium corymbosum)-Incorrect soil pH,"A soil pH of 4.5 to 5.5 is optimum for blueberry production. Soil pH values significantly outside of this range are associated with a variety of problems. Surveys indicate this as one of the more important problems throughout the blueberry industry. Iron deficiency symptoms are common since iron is less available for plant uptake at high soil pH. High soil pH may occur when a new blueberry field follows other crops that have required the addition of agricultural lime. Some research indicates iron deficiency occurs when urea is applied in limed soil, resulting in an increase in rhizosphere pH. Using lime-containing materials, such as some livestock manures, for blueberry production can also induce high soil pH.
In areas west of the Cascade Range, the native soil pH is usually acidic. Low soil pH; however, can also be a problem. At low soil pH, soil aluminum becomes more available, which impedes plant uptake of nitrogen and phosphorus, and possibly iron uptake as well. Low soil pH is often a result of soil acidification caused by nitrogen fertilizer application over time. The overdose of sulfur during soil acidification can also yield low soil pH.


","Iron deficiency symptoms include stunted plant growth and interveinal chlorosis of leaves. (Leaves turn yellow between the veins.) Plants exhibit general decline in growth with yellow to pale leaves, low vigor and low yield. Other nonspecific nutrient or disease problems may occur due to improper soil pH.


","It is important to monitor and keep a record of soil pH on a yearly basis and take corrective actions if necessary.

1) Plant hydrangeas at the end of blueberry rows to monitor soil pH. Many cultivars have blue flowers when soils are in the correct pH range. Flowers turn purple to pink as the pH increases beyond the optimum range for blueberries. Avoid white cultivars or ones that are bred to be pink all the time.

2) Locate new blueberry plantings on soil that is near or within the correct pH range of 4.5 to 5.5.

3) Adjust soil pH before planting with lime or sulfur-based on soil test results.

3.1) Sulfur at 1 ton/A would be needed to lower a pH 6 clay loam soil to 4.5. Although this rate is fine before planting, once blueberries have been planted, use no more than 200 to 400 lb/A at any one time. Changes in soil pH will be slow and may take up to a year for results to show in soil tests. 
3.2) Use ground limestone if soil pH is below 4.0. 
4) Use ammonium sulfate as a nitrogen source especially if soil pH is on the high side. Repeated use can lower soil pH below the optimum range.

5) Use urea instead of ammonia sulfate under low soil pH.

6) Increase soil organic matter to reduce free soil aluminum under low soil pH.

Blueberry ,(Vaccinium corymbosum)-Mummy Berry,"The fungus Monilinia vaccinii-corymbosi overwinters in mummified fruit (pseudosclerotia) on the ground. Mummies can survive for at least 2 years and maybe more. Often mummified fruit becomes caught between the stems of a single plant near the ground. Mummies have a chilling requirement of many hours below 45°F. In early spring, when the temperature rises above 45°F, about the time buds begin to break, fungal fruiting cups (apothecia) grow from overwintering mummies in or near the soil surface. Apothecia mature over an average period of 17 days but can range from 10 to 28 days. Many apothecia can emerge from just one mummy. Soil temperature, soil moisture, and solar radiation were identified as the most important factors influencing ascospore release in the PNW.
Ascospores (primary inoculum) from apothecia are wind dispersed 100 feet or more and infect leaves and flowers shortly after buds open. A second type of spore (conidia or secondary inoculum) is produced in about 3 weeks on blighted flowers and shoots. These spores are spread by wind, rain, and various insect pollinators to healthy flowers. Flowers are most susceptible just as they open and infections lead to the mummy berry symptom. Flowers that are already pollinated are less susceptible to infection.
The potential for loss is greater for primary infection because a single infection can blight all the flowers of one cluster. The losses from secondary infection can also be significant but the potential is less because only one berry is lost from each infection.
Infected, sporulating shoots become ultraviolet reflective, fragrant and secrete sugars all of which attract insect pollinators. Insects then move conidia from these infected shoots to healthy flowers increasing the number of infected berries.
All species of Vaccinium are infected by species of Monilinia causing a mummy berry-like disease in each. Each species, however, is highly specialized to its host and therefore cannot induce disease in other hosts. For example, the fungal species attacking red huckleberry cannot attack highbush blueberry and vice versa.
The blueberry cultivars Bluejay, Bluetta, and Olympia are considered resistant to both phases of the disease while the cultivars Blueray, Berkeley, Earliblue, and Northland are considered very susceptible.


","Infected flowers turn brown and wither, as if they had been frosted. Stems and shoots turn dark-brown with the necrosis extending into leaf petioles and slightly into the base of leaf blades. Shoots quickly collapse and die soon after. About 3 weeks after primary infection, a brownish gray mass of spores develops on blighted flower stalks and leaves.
During early berry development, diseased fruits look like healthy ones; if cut open; however, the spongy white fungal growth can be seen within the carpels. As berries approach maturity, infected berries become a reddish buff or tan color in contrast to the waxy green of healthy fruits. Many of the diseased berries fall before healthy berries are harvested. Mature mummified berries are gray, shriveled, and hard.
Apothecia can be found under bushes where leaf debris or mulch has been left undisturbed. In spring, before bloom urn-shaped apothecia emerge from the mummies and are light brown to brown. The tip of the stem is darker and eventually expands into a cup-shaped structure 0.1 to 0.4 inch wide.

Blueberry ,"(Vaccinium corymbosum)-Nematode, Dagger","Xiphinema americanum and related species.  Xiphinema americanum is the vector for Tobacco ringspot virus and Tomato ringspot virus. Dagger nematodes are migratory ectoparasites and therefore found only in soil. As virus vectors, they can be damaging at very low population levels. Dagger nematode populations may be very low in late summer when other nematodes are abundant. Surveys have only found this nematode associated with blueberry fields in southern Washington and the Willamette Valley of Oregon.


","Dagger nematodes cause little direct root damage to plants unless they are present in high numbers. More important are the viruses they transmit that cause significant damage.

2) Cover crop with tall fescue or rapeseed in the year(s) prior to planting.

3) Fallow the year prior to planting. Diligently control broadleaf weeds during the fallow year to eliminate possible hosts.

4) Plant virus-tested (and found to be free of all known viruses) certified stock.

Blueberry ,"(Vaccinium corymbosum)-Nematode, Root-lesion","Pratylenchus penetrans, P. thornei and P. neglectus have been found in established blueberry fields. Root-lesion nematodes are migratory endoparasites with part of the population in soil and part in the roots at all times.

Blueberry ,(Vaccinium corymbosum)-Ripe Rot (Anthracnose),"Colletotrichum acutatum (sexual: Glomerella acutata), fungi. This disease can appear on fruit before harvest (ripe rot) but more often appears as a postharvest fruit rot. Warm, wet conditions favor disease spread and buildup. Spores are dispersed by splashing rain or irrigation. Infection can occur any time during bloom and berry development. About 10 to 12 hours of continual leaf wetness at 52°F to 80°F is necessary for infection. Berry infections remain quiescent (latent) until fruit is nearly mature. The fungus overwinters in blighted twigs, fruit trusses and floral bud scales. Floral bud scales that persist on fruit clusters are considered an important source of the fungus. Removal and destruction of prunings from the field did not reduce primary inoculum and had little impact on disease development.
The cultivars such as Bluecrop, Blueray, Bluetta, Earliblue, Herbert, and Spartan are very susceptible while the cultivars Collins, Elliot, and Weymouth are considered resistant.


","Blighting of shoot tips may be observed first. Then, a few flowers turn brown or black. Leaf spots, when they occur, are large or small and roughly circular. As infected berries ripen, the flower end may soften and pucker. Under warm and rainy conditions, salmon-colored spore masses form on infected berries. However, there may also be no indication of disease prior to harvest. After harvest, spore masses form rapidly on infected fruit when in cellophane-covered baskets or in plastic clamshell packs.


","A combination of cultural and chemical practices is most helpful in combating losses due to this disease.

1) Avoid overhead irrigation or apply such that plants are not wet for extended periods of time.

2) Lower the temperature of harvested fruit as soon as possible after picking.

3) Prune bushes for adequate airflow and to reduce drying time after becoming wet.

","Apply during bloom and use along with cultural practices. Applications may be needed after bloom in especially wet years. Exclusive use of some products, such as Indar (Group 3 fungicide), for mummy berry management has resulted in elevated levels of anthracnose. Although this may be an artifact of fungicide testing trials, addition of broad-spectrum fungicides in an overall program is recommended.

"
Blueberry ,(Vaccinium corymbosum)-Root Rot,"Phytophthora root rot, caused primarily by the oomycete Phytophthora cinnamomi, is a soilborne disease affecting blueberry in the Pacific Northwest. It is primarily a warm weather pathogen and does not survive well where soils freeze deeply or repeatedly in winter. This fungus-like organism has an extremely wide host range and infects a large number of tree and shrub species in the Pacific Northwest including other ericaceous plants (such as rhododendron and madrone) and many conifers.
The organism is spread in water, soil, and on infected nursery stock. It can survive for many years in the soil as chlamydospores or oospores. When soil moisture is abundant, it produces swimming spores called zoospores. These zoospores swim towards fine roots where they infect and kill the root system. As a consequence, root rot is much more severe in poorly drained, heavy soils. The disease is often considered mainly to be a problem of young plants during the establishment phase. Older plants with larger root systems are better able to compensate for root rot without apparent symptoms as long as the site is well-drained. Use of fresh sawdust is conducive to these fungi in other crops while use of composed bark is supressive.
While all highbush blueberry cultivars are susceptible to the pathogen, some, such as 'Aurora,' 'Clockwork,' 'Legacy,' 'Liberty,' 'Overtime,' 'Patriot,' and 'Reka,' appear to be slightly more resistant to the disease. Cultivars Bluecrop, Bluetta, Blue Ribbon, Cargo, Draper, Duke, Last Call, Top Shelf, Toro, and Ventura are considered very susceptible.


","Symptoms are usually most severe on young plants. Initially, infected plants are stunted, appearing smaller than neighboring healthy plants. The leaves may be undersized and chlorotic, and may turn red prematurely. Leaf scorch symptoms (necrotic leaf margins) can also develop as the root system becomes compromised. Severe infection can lead to wilting and death, particularly in younger plants or under conducive conditions. However, older plants with larger root reserves can survive for years with a chronic infection and may never fully succumb to the disease. Infection in the roots is first observed causing a brownish-black rot on the fine feeder roots. Lesions may extend up into larger roots and eventually up into the canes, producing a firm, reddish-brown rot that is delineated from the surrounding, healthy white-green tissue at the lesion's leading edge.


","Integrate several cultural and/or chemical tactics to manage this disease.

1) Plant only disease-free plants. Inspect and discard any incoming diseased nursery stock.

2) Amend soils with composted sawdust or bark mulch to provide good aeration for roots.

3) Plant in beds raised so that the top of the bed is at least 12 inches above the surrounding soil. Amend soil with gypsum (1 to 5 tons/A) before making raised beds and planting.

4) Do not over-irrigate, especially in drip irrigation fields, so that the soil is saturated for 48 hours or more. Irrigate deeply and allow drying between irrigations. It is recommended to bury drip lines or place emitters 1 foot away from the base of the plant.

5) Do not overfertilize with nitrogen. Higher levels of phosphorus and potassium appear to help by stimulating root production. High levels of nitrogen, which normally would cause only leaf burn on healthy plants, may kill -infected plants.

6) Ensure drainage away from plants in wet or poorly drained soil. Subsoiling at 18 to 24 inches beside the row often helps. Planting into raised beds or hills will also help.

7) Dig out plants with 50% or more mortality to roots and tops. They are unlikely to recover even with chemical treatment.

8) Avoid reusing pots from a previous crop for propagation. If pots must be reused then wash off all debris and soak in a sanitizing solution or treat with aerated steam for 30 min.

","Protect roots just before significant growth. Blueberry plants generally have two main root growth peaks. One in the spring just before shoot growth begins and another in late summer after harvest. Time chemical applications just before these peaks. Alternate chemicals from different groups with different modes of action to avoid problems with resistant strains.
The Group 4 and Group 33 fungicides used to manage Phytophthora do not kill this organism. They can only prevent establishment of the organism before it gets into the plant. They can also prevent continued growth if the organism is already inside the plant thereby delaying symptoms that might have developed. Once chemical activity has subsided with time, the organism can resume growth within infected plants.

8.1) Established plantings: Ridomil Gold SL at 0.25 pint/1000 linear ft of row (3.6 pints/A broadcast basis) in 3-ft band centered on the plant row before plants start growth in spring. In severe situations, an additional application may be made in midseason when irrigating or in fall. A second application usually is not needed.
8.2) New plantings: Apply Ridomil Gold SL in an 18-inch band centered on the plant row at or after planting using the 3.6-pints/A broadcast rate. The amount actually used per acre will depend on row spacing. Make supplemental applications at 2- to 3-month intervals.

Blueberry ,(Vaccinium corymbosum)-Rust,"Thekopsora minima and Naohidemyces vaccinii (both formerly Pucciniastrum vaccinii),  fungi. Leaf rust is usually of minor importance being a problem on lowbush, rabbiteye, southern highbush or ornamental blueberries that do not shed leaves in the winter. This disease can impact yield due to early defoliation and reduction in return bloom in the following year. These fungi have also been reported on the deciduous huckleberry (Vaccinium membranaceum) from all PNW states and on cranberry in Oregon and Washington. A different Pucciniastrum species is common on evergreen huckleberry. It is not known if evergreen huckleberry is a host of P. vaccinii.
Hemlock (western or Pacific hemlock, Tsuga heterophylla, and the mountain or black hemlock, T. mertensiana) is the alternate host where circular aecia erupt from beneath the epidermis on the lower side of current-season needles in yellow spots. The OSU Plant Clinic has never received samples of hemlock rust but it has been reported from all states in the PNW. An alternate host is not needed for blueberries that do not lose their leaves.
In the spring, airborne aeciospores from hemlock infect newly emerging blueberry leaves. Uredinia form about midsummer on the lower side of leaves. Urediniospores reinfect blueberry in a repeating secondary cycle. This leads to rapid inoculum buildup and disease spread especially on plants that lose leaves late or not at all. The latent period may be completed in only 10 days at 68°F. The pathogen does not systemically invade blueberry. Telia form within the epidermal cells of infected leaves, which eventually drop to the ground. Basidia arise from germinating teliospores in dead leaves, and basidiospores infect young hemlock needles in the spring.


","The first symptoms observe include small, chlorotic to yellow spots. Spots on the upper surface of the leaf turn reddish-brown. The entire leaf may die if numerous spots coalesce and become necrotic. On the underside of the leaf, opposite upper leaf symptoms, yellowish-orange pustules (uredinia) develop that turn rusty-red with age. Infected leaves usually drop prematurely.


","

1) Remove hemlocks upwind from where blueberry is grown.

2) Grow less susceptible cultivars.

3) Prompt removal and disposal of fallen leaves may be helpful.

"
Blueberry ,(Vaccinium corymbosum)-Scorch,"The Blueberry scorch virus (BlScV), which is vectored by aphids, can infect blueberry and cranberry. Groups of 25 aphids transmit the virus 10% to 15% of the time. Transmission can occur between early May through early August. Once a plant is infected, symptoms may take 1 to 2 years or more to develop. This makes early detection vital for controlling the disease. The virus was first observed in a 'Berkeley' blueberry planting near Puyallup, WA in 1980 and was initially observed in western Oregon and Washington (near Puyallup and in Clark County), but not northern Washington or in the Fraser River Valley of British Columbia. An outbreak of BlScV with more severe symptoms was reported in British Columbia during the summer of 2000. 'Sheep Pen Hill Disease,' first reported in New Jersey in the 1960's, is now known to be caused by BlScV. The strain of BlScV initially identified in New Jersey causes symptoms in cultivars except Jersey, whereas the strains initially identified in Oregon and Washington were symptomless in Bluecrop and Duke as well as several other cultivars. There is a much broader range of BlScV strains in B.C. than in New Jersey, Oregon and Washington, suggesting the virus may have evolved in native hosts in B.C. BlScV has been found throughout the main blueberry production areas of B.C.; all planting material from B.C. should be considered suspect and potentially infected with the virus. Quarantines are in effect for Washington and Oregon to restrict the movement of plants from states where the disease occurs. The virus has also been detected in the Netherlands, Germany, Italy, and Poland.


","In spring, shoot tips die back; sometimes on only one or a few branches. Flowers blight just as the earliest ones begin to open. Early symptoms may be confused with bacterial canker or mummy berry. The entire bush becomes infected within 1 to 3 years. Infected plants repeat this symptom cycle each spring. (In contrast, plants infected with the Blueberry shock virus will recover.) Fruit production and shoot growth are markedly reduced on infected plants. Tolerant cultivars may show some yellowing of the leaf margins but no blighting of flowers or leaves. Other viruses and pathogens, as well as frost damage, can cause similar symptoms.
The cultivars Olympia and Stanley only exhibited a marginal leaf necrosis, 'Bluecrop' develops a general chlorosis, and Jersey is the only northern highbush cultivar that remains symptomless. In some cultivars, with some strains of the virus, an oak-leaf pattern develops in the fall, but this symptom is easily overlooked.


","When the disease is first suspected, have plants tested to confirm the presence of this specific virus. Do not wait until the following year to see if symptoms reoccur before testing, delaying control measures will increase the number of plants that will need to be removed. Remove infected plants that exhibit blighting, test adjacent plants to identify infected but symptomless plants. Monitor the field for at least three years for symptoms.

1) Remove any infected plants that show blighting or that test positive for the virus.

2) Replant with certified virus-tested (and found to be free of all known viruses), disease-tolerant plants. Tolerant cultivars include Bluecrop, Bluetta, Concord, Duke, 1613-A (Hardiblue), Ivanhoe, Jersey, Lateblue, Nelson, Nui, Olympia, Puru, Ranococas, and Reka.

3) Control the aphid vector.

4) If purchasing plants, confirm that they have been tested as free of the scorch virus.

",,
Blueberry ,(Vaccinium corymbosum)-Shock,"The Blueberry shock virus (BlShV), which is pollenborne. Transmission occurs when pollinators, especially foraging honeybees, transfer infected pollen to flowers on healthy plants. The cultivars Berkeley, Bluegold, Bluetta, Duke, Liberty, Aurora, Pemberton, Reka, and Elliott are particularly susceptible and the virus spreads rapidly through a field. In 'Bluecrop', 'Bluejay', 'Mini Blue', 'Calypso', 'Legacy', 'Perpetua', 'Reka', and 'Toro' the virus spreads very slowly in the field. The disease cannot be eliminated by removing and destroying plants with symptoms once it appears in a field. Plants that have recovered from the symptoms appear to produce a full crop, but these plants can continue to serve as an inoculum source for nearby plants and for any new plantings. Plants (such as Huron) that are infected within the first year or two after planting may be more seriously affected by this disease than older plants. The disease has been confirmed in Oregon (from Eugene northward), Washington and British Columbia. It has not been found in southern Oregon. Many states and countries require testing and certification of nursery stock as free of shock and scorch.
Cranberry was initially thought to be a symptomless host but it has been associated with cranberry fruit scaring.


","Flowers and young vegetative leaf shoots suddenly die in spring when flowers are just about to open. The entire bush may be blighted, but more commonly only a portion of the branches will show symptoms. These symptoms represent the plant's ""shock reaction"" to infection. Blighted tissues drop; as the season progresses, a second flush of leaves is produced. By late summer, affected plants look normal except they produce little fruit. Leaves that do not blight in spring may show thin red ringspots on both sides of the leaf. Plants may exhibit the shock reaction for 1 to 3 years and may be symptom-free thereafter although they still carry the virus.
Once plants recover, they may continue to show leaf discoloration including spots, line patterns, blotches and/or reddening for several more years. These ""after shock"" symptoms were intense on leaves formed during the cool wet spring of 2010 but lessened on leaves produced after warm dry conditions prevailed in the summer.


","

1) Use certified planting stock for new plantings.

2) Do not establish new fields adjacent to infected fields.

3) Maintain good cultural care of infected plants while they are going through seasons with the shock reaction.

4) For small plantings, let the disease run its course. In larger plantings, rogue plants only if infected ones are confined to a small area; otherwise let the disease run its course.

Blueberry ,(Vaccinium corymbosum)-Silver Leaf,"Silver leaf is not new to the PNW as it has been a minor problem on stone fruit for many years. It is a disease where the fungus, Chondrostereum purpureum, invades cut or wounded stems and limbs of a wide variety of plants. This fungus was confirmed for the first time in 2014 by the OSU Plant Clinic on 'Draper' and 'Liberty' blueberry with silver leaf symptoms although samples with these symptoms had been received since 2009. Symptoms of the disease have also been observed on 'Duke', and 'Topshelf'. Symptoms occur in western Oregon, northern Washington, and BC. The cultivars Brigitta and Bluecrop are susceptible in other blueberry production areas in addition to the cultivars Draper and Duke.
Silver leaf is also known to affect sweet cherries, apples, pears, peaches, plums, nectarines, some small fruits, alder, willow and poplar. The fungus is a saprophyte growing on dead trees, prunings, stumps, posts, and fallen logs. Small bracket-like fruiting bodies are produced in the fall and winter during moist weather. Spores are produced during wet weather and blown for miles. Spores germinate and enter living tissue through a fresh surface wound such as pruning cuts, mechanical injury, winter injury, and/or insect damage. Pruning cuts are most susceptible within 1 week of wounding. After infection, fungus growth is systemic into the root crown of the bush.


","During the summer the top surface of young leaves turns silvery. Symptoms may start on 1 or 2 branches, which show reduced growth and die in two or three seasons. New branches on the same plant continue to develop symptoms until the whole bush is affected. Symptoms in 'Draper' seem to begin about 3 or 4 years after planting.
The heartwood of infected stems may turn brown or exhibit purple to brown concentric rings of discoloration. This discoloration is more accentuated at the base of bushes and branches and may not be found in stem cross sections higher up on symptomatic branches. The root system does not show symptoms.
Fruiting bodies (basidiocarps) may develop in the fall on the surface of dead or dying branches. Fruiting bodies can be quite variable in form appearing either as flat incrustations up to several inches long that cover infected branches or as bracket-shaped projections, 1- to 3-inches wide, arranged in tiers. Bracket undersurfaces, the sporulating surfaces, usually are purple although color may vary from salmon pink to purple.


","

1) Remove and destroy symptomatic plants. Destroy all dead wood removed from 'Draper' fields.

2) Burn all prunings. The fungus will fruit only on dead wood, and pruning piles are often the source of reinfection in other fruit systems.

3) Take care to prevent unnecessary injuries to bushes. Use proper branch pruning techniques.

4) If possible, prune 'Draper' in dry weather such as after harvest in late summer before the fall rains.

","Injection of fungicides into diseased trees has not had an effect on disease progression in tree fruit. Chemical protection of pruning wounds is possible but there are no chemical registrations.


","The fungus Trichoderma viride has been shown to protect pruning wounds but there are no registrations.


"
Blueberry ,(Vaccinium corymbosum)-Stem Canker,"Botryosphaeria corticis, a fungus. The disease has not been a problem in the Pacific Northwest but has been found in Oregon. 'Bluecrop', 'Blueray', 'Duke', and 'Ozarkblue' were, on average, more susceptible to B. dothidea while 'Northblue' was more resistant under controlled conditions.


","The principal canes are affected. Reddish conical swellings appear in summer and fall on current-year canes. Small pimple-like swellings (pycnidia) develop on the canes' surface. The lesions enlarge and become fissured in the second year, giving the cane a rough, blistered appearance. Later, canes may become girdled and die.

1) Prune out and destroy infected branches.

2) Plant disease-free nursery stock. Carefully inspect plants arriving from New Jersey or from the Southern States where this disease is a problem.

Blueberry ,(Vaccinium corymbosum)-Twig Blight,"Diaporthe vaccinii (asexual Phomopsis vaccinii), a fungus that overwinters in infected plant debris. In the spring, spores are dispersed from fruiting bodies (pycnidia) embedded in diseased tissue by rain splash and irrigation water. Infection occurs through flower buds from budbreak to bloom. The disease spreads from flowers into shoots and twigs. The fungus can also infect through injuries such as wounds from pruning, harvest equipment, frost cracks and herbicide injury and produces girdling cankers. The fungus can also cause a fruit rot. Historically the disease was not common in the Pacific Northwest but has grown in importance in British Columbia with the planting of 'Draper' and 'Liberty'. The disease can get established in newly planted fields where fungicides are not regularly used. 'Duke', 'Legacy' and 'Powderblue' were, on the average, more susceptible while 'Rubel' was more resistant under controlled conditions.


","Dieback of flowers, twigs, and shoots. Cankers may be present at the base of infected canes. Cankers are seen as elongated, flattened areas that become covered with small, pinpoint-sized fruiting bodies (pycnidia) that produce spores. Tissue around the canker can appear silvery and speckled with black dots. Infected stems will wilt during the summer and the leaves turn color earlier, causing a red flagging. Can be confused with bacterial canker.

Blueberry ,(Vaccinium corymbosum)-Twig Canker,"Sporocadus lichenicola (sexual: Discostroma corticola), a fungus that can infect blueberry plants suffering from winter injury, sunscald, or damage from other sources. Infection may require a previous low temperature injury of the plant. Has been found sporadically in the Willamette and Hood River Valleys of Oregon. The fungus can also infect red and black raspberry, 'Loganberry', and Himalaya and evergreen blackberry.


","Twigs have multiple, grey-white cankers with reddish margins associated with nodes and range from 0.25 inch to the entire length of the twig. Dark-brown-to-black fruiting bodies (pycnidia) are found within cankers. Extensive stem cankers can girdle and kill infected twigs.


","Tactics that minimize winter or other injury to plants is encouraged.

","None are registered or known for this disease.


",
Blueberry ,(Vaccinium corymbosum)-Verticillium Wilt,"Verticillium dahliae has been recovered from branch or crown tissue of new 'Bluetta' blueberry plantings from Washington and Oregon but considered rare.  Plants were 2-4 years old and found on the cultivars Aurora, Blue Ribbon, and Cargo. Plants had been grown where previous crops were potatoes and peppermint, both of which are hosts. The disease was worse on soils where the pH was above 5.5, which is higher than optimum for blueberry.
This is a soilborne fungus that may remain viable in soil for years. The fungus forms microsclerotia within infected tissues. Once in the soil they germinate and infect roots. The fungus grows into the xylem where it colonizes the plant through mycelial growth and conidial production. Fluid movement in the xylem passively transports the conidia. Once in the xylem, this fungus partially blocks water movement and produces toxins that result in wilt symptoms. Plant-parasitic nematodes also can increase disease incidence and severity.


","Plants had poor vigor, localized cankers due to opportunistic fungi, reddening or chlorosis of leaves, and numerous dead buds and twigs. Symptoms resemble a dieback. There was no internal discoloration of the xylem as is typical in some other hosts.


","At this point there is no research-based information from blueberry so management tactics are borrowed from other crop systems where this disease is a problem. In all cases curative measures do not exist.

1) Do not plant in soils where -susceptible crops (such as potatoes and peppermint) have been grown previously.

2) Control weeds.

3) Avoid measures that promote succulent growth. Research on control of Verticillium wilt in other crops indicates that nitrogenous fertilizers should be used at minimum rates-sufficient only to provide normal growth.

4) Crop rotation is of only limited benefit to reduce populations due to a wide host range and long survival in soil.

5) Incorporation of green manures, cover crops, or other organic amendments into field soils prior to planting can be effective at reducing the impact of Verticillium wilt in some crops.

6) Remove and destroy symptomatic or dead branches preferably before leaves fall and thus before new inoculum gets incorporated into the ground.

Blueberry ,(Vaccinium corymbosum)-Virus Diseases,"At least six viruses have been found in highbush blueberry plantings in the Pacific Northwest: Blueberry mosaic virus, Blueberry red ringspot virus, Blueberry scorch virus, Blueberry shock virus, Tobacco ringspot virus, and Tomato ringspot virus. Six other virus and virus-like diseases of highbush blueberry occur in the Eastern States but either have not been reported or are uncommon in the Pacific Northwest: Blueberry leaf mottle virus, Peach rosette mosaic virus, Blueberry shoestring virus, Blueberry necrotic ring blotch virus, Blueberry virus A, and the Stunt Phytoplasma.
A premature fruit-drop symptom was observed in several 'Bluecrop' blueberry fields in Oregon, Washington and British Columbia around 2004. The plants flower normally, though the young leaves and flowers have a transient red coloration that is absent in healthy plants. The fruit develops to 3 to 5 mm in diameter and then aborts so that affected bushes have virtually no fruit at harvest. The incidence within fields increases year-to-year suggesting that a pathogen is involved. Late summer of 2013, a virus was associated with this disease, but only a limited number of plants have been tested. Symptomatic plants from 3 fields in B.C. and northern Washington have tested positive for the virus and asymptomatic plants have tested negative. At this time it is not known if other cultivars of blueberry are symptomless, resistant or simply not infected with this virus.


","
Blueberry mosaic-light green, yellow, and sometimes pink and white patchy mottling on leaves. Symptoms may be irregularly distributed on an infected plant and may show some years but not others. Symptoms are dramatic in 'Regita'. Fruit is reduced in quantity and quality and may ripen late. Blueberry mosaic spreads slowly in the field by unknown means. No resistant cultivars are known. This disease is of relatively little concern. All cultivars are self-indicators. An Ophiovirus has been identified in plants exhibiting these symptoms and since detected in plants exhibiting mosaic symptoms in B.C., OR, WA, CA, MI, NJ, AR, NC, Japan, and Slovenia. The vector of the virus has not been identified at this time.
Blueberry red ringspot-small, superficial reddish rings on canes, upper surfaces of leaves, and occasionally on fruit. Rings are most noticeable in August and September. This virus does not appear to spread naturally in the field in the Pacific Northwest, although it does so by unknown means in the Eastern States. 'Bluecrop' is resistant; 'Blueray', 'Bluetta', 'Burlington', 'Coville', 'Darrow', 'Earliblue', and 'Rubel' are susceptible. Testing for this virus is best done by PCR using recently developed primers from New Jersey. These primers can also be used to detect cranberry red ringspot in cranberry
Blueberry scorch-in spring, shoot tips die back, sometimes on only one branch of the plant. Flowers blight just as the earliest ones begin to open. May resemble symptoms caused by bacterial canker and mummy berry. There is a serological test for this virus. Infected plants repeat this symptom cycle each spring. 'Atlantic', 'Berkeley', 'Collins', 'Herbert', and 'Pemberton' are particularly susceptible, but no immune cultivars are known. Several cultivars are symptomless and are considered tolerant. The cultivars Bluecrop and Duke are tolerant but show symptoms in British Columbia where a different strain of the virus is suspected.
Blueberry shock-symptoms resemble those of the Blueberry Scorch Virus but may not reappear in spring growth in years following initial infection, although plants remain infected. This virus is spread by pollen moved by wind or bees. There is a serological test for it. The cultivars particularly susceptible are Berkeley, Bluegold, Bluetta, Duke, Liberty, Aurora, Pemberton, Reka, and Elliott are and the virus spreads rapidly through a field. In 'Bluecrop' and 'Bluejay' the virus spreads very slowly in the field. No immune cultivars are known; the virus is symptomless in some cultivars when they are newly infected. For small plantings, let the disease run its course. In larger plantings, rogue plants only if infected ones are confined to a small area; otherwise let the disease run its course. Plants that have recovered from the symptoms appear to produce a full crop, but these plants can continue to serve as an inoculum source for nearby plants and for any new plantings.
Blueberry shoestring-although it is most prevalent in Michigan and New Jersey, Blueberry shoestring virus has been detected in Washington and Oregon. Plants shipped from back east have a higher probability of being infected. Aphids spread the virus, but the vector has not been found in the Pacific Northwest. The most prominent symptoms are elongated reddish streaks on current-year and year-old stems. During flowering, some petals exhibit red streaks. Affected leaves are strap-like, curled, or crescent-shaped. Yield of infected bushes decreases greatly.
Tobacco ringspot-a necrotic ringspot on leaves. Dead spots may drop out, giving leaves a shothole or tattered appearance. Leaves may be deformed, stems die back, and stunting and slow decline leading to plant death may occur. Fruit yield and quality are severely depressed. This virus is spread in the soil by the dagger nematode (see Blueberry-Nematode, Dagger), leading to expanding circles of affected plants. There are serological tests for this virus. Most cultivars are susceptible, but Jersey is resistant to the common strain of the virus. This virus is very rare in the Pacific Northwest.
Tomato ringspot-distortion, circular chlorotic lesions on leaves, and necrotic stem lesions. Shoot dieback, stunting, and plant death may eventually occur. Fruit yield and quality are severely depressed. This virus is spread in the soil by the dagger nematode (see Blueberry-Nematode, Dagger), leading to expanding circles of affected plants. Infected plants of cultivars Atlantic, Dixie, Earliblue, Olympia, and Pemberton have been identified in western Oregon where this virus was common in blueberry studies. 'Bluecrop' appears resistant in the field.


","

1) For all viruses, use virus-tested (and found to be free of all known viruses) certified stock. With the number of viruses of blueberry that are not present in the PNW it is critical to ensure that only virus-tested plants be brought into the region from other parts of the country.

2) For all viruses, rogue out infected plants.

3) Before planting blueberries, test soil in spring for dagger nematodes, and do not plant until soil has been fumigated.

4) If available, use resistant or tolerant cultivars to avoid repeat damage by a given virus.

5) For small plantings, let Blueberry shock run its course. In larger plantings, rogue plants only if infected ones are confined to a small area; otherwise let the disease run its course. Plants that have recovered from the symptoms appear to produce a full crop, but these plants can continue to serve as an inoculum source for nearby plants and for any new plantings.

6) Management of insect vectors is helpful to prevent infection and reduce spread. See the PNW Insect Management Handbook for details.

Blueberry ,(Vaccinium corymbosum)-Witches' Broom Rust,,,,,
Boston Ivy ,(Parthenocissus tricuspidata)-Downy Mildew,"The fungus-like organism Plasmopara muralis (formerly Plasmopara viticola clade quinquefolia) was detected on Boston ivy plants in the landscape and grown as nursery plants in Oregon in late 2001. Surveys during 2002 found the disease at many wholesale and retail nurseries in both Oregon and Washington. Both Boston ivy and Virginia creeper were found infected. One landscape planting of Boston ivy without overhead irrigation had symptoms and signs of the disease. This may indicate that western Oregon can sustain natural spread and expression of this disease.
Laboratory and field tests have shown that the strain on Boston Ivy was unable to infect grape.
It can be spread by transporting infected vines, nursery stock or within plant debris or soil that contains oospores of the organism. The organism can overwinter or be transmitted as mycelium in dormant buds. Overhead irrigation during the summer encourages disease development.


","Greenish-yellow, angular blotches appear on the upper leaf surface. The lower leaf surface has light-brown spots covered with a white, fungal growth during moist weather. Late in the season lesions turn dark-brown-to-black before leaves fall from the vine. Lesions can be on any green part of the vine. Heavily infected leaves may fall prematurely.


","Scout for symptoms of the disease.

1) Do not transport infected stock into the region.

2) Scout plants for any sign of the disease. Check newly planted stock originating out of state. If it is suspected, get diseased plant samples to a public diagnostic laboratory as soon as possible to confirm the diagnosis.

3) Remove and destroy infected plant and plant parts.

4) Space plants for better air circulation. Water in the morning or in such a way that leaves do not remain wet for extended periods of time. Use drip irrigation.

5) Maintain adequate fertility.

","There are no fungicides specifically registered for this crop. These fungicides are legal to use if not phytotoxic and may have activity against this disease:


1) Aliette WDG at 2.5 lb/100 gal water. Do not use within 1 week of copper spray. Group 33 fungicide. 12-hr reentry.

2) Fosphite at 1 to 2 quarts/100 gal water. Do not use copper products within 20 days of treatment and do not use spray adjuvants. Group 33 fungicide. 4-hr reentry.

Boston Ivy ,(Parthenocissus tricuspidata)-Leaf Scorch,,,,,
Boston Ivy ,(Parthenocissus tricuspidata)-Leaf Spot,"The fungus Phyllosticta ampelicida (formerly Guignardia bidwellii) has been found in Oregon. This is a slightly different form of the fungus that causes black rot of grape, which is not common in the PNW. Note that Phyllosticta parthenocissi would be the name of the pathogen on Virinia Creeper (P. quinquefolia).


","Necrotic leaf spots that generally are round but may be angular as they are constrained by large leaf veins. Spots may have a dark brown outline and then a chlorotic halo. Spots have lighter brown centers with black fruiting bodies (pycnidia) in the necrotic area. Leaves may have numerous spots and can result in defoliation.

Boston Ivy ,(Parthenocissus tricuspidata)-Powdery Mildew,,,,,
Boxwood ,(Buxus spp.)-Black Root Rot,,,,,
Boxwood ,(Buxus spp.)-Box Blight,"The fungus Calonectria pseudonaviculata (synonyms Cylindrocladium pseudonaviculatum or C. buxicola) was found for the first time late in 2011 in only three Oregon nurseries and four in British Columbia. Eradication efforts were initiated but have not been completely successful. The disease has been found in seven Oregon nurseries (Wasington and Marion counties) but also in landscapes in Clackamas, Multnomah, and Coos counties and in Seattle, WA. It has also been found in numerous nurseries and landscapes in Eastern North America. It has been a problem for many years in Europe and New Zealand. Calonectria henricotiea is an important species found only in Europe that is resistant to many fungicides. The disease is especially severe where plants are sheared tightly and/or planted in hedges. Due to the history of this disease, its explosive life cycle, and low level in tolerant plants, it is expected to be an ever-increasing problem throughout the PNW.
Hosts include many Buxus spp. and cultivars, Pachysandra, and Sarcococca. The three main boxwood species-Buxus sempervirens, B. microphylla (littleleaf boxwood), and B. sinica var. insularis (Korean boxwood)-are known hosts. Buxus colchica and B. microphylla var. japonica (Japanese boxwood) are also hosts. There are no resistant cultivars; however, tests in North Carolina have found B. sinica var. insularis 'Nana' and B. microphylla var. japonica 'Green Beauty' to be tolerant although they still carry the fungus.
The fungus can survive in fallen leaves for up to 5 years and can produce spores in a sticky, slimy matrix when environmental conditions become suitable. Mild wet weather west of the Cascade Range is conducive for long-term survival and infection. Microsclerotia (long-lived survival structures) are formed within infected tissue, released into the soil when the tissues breaks down, and subsequently initiate new infections when splashed onto foliage. Infection can occur very quickly in warm (64°F to 77°F), wet conditions. High humidity levels or free water are needed in order for infection to occur. No infections occur below 43°F. Only young leaves became infected at 54°F but need to be wet for 48 hours. Dry breaks of 3 hours or more during wet periods resulted in less disease development. The fungus can penetrate the leaf through the cuticle or enter through leaf stomata. New lesions and spores can be produced within a single week under favorable conditions. Short-distance dispersal occurs through water or rain splash (especially wind-driven rain) and human activities such as pruning. Long-distance dispersal can occur through the transport of infected nursery stock or infected plant debris. Spores are unlikely to travel long distances by wind alone.
Younger leaves of 'Justin Brouwers' and 'Nana' are more susceptible than older leaves but younger leaves of 'John Baldwin' were less susceptible than older leaves.
Volutella buxi, Volutella blight, often colonizes diseased stems associated with this disease.


","Dark or light brown spots on leaves, often in a circular or zonate pattern, black streaks or cankers on stems, straw- to bronze-colored blighted foliage, and defoliation. Blighting and defoliation can occur suddenly, with complete leaf loss in severe cases. Leaf spots can grow together to cover the entire leaf surface. Downy white fungal growth may be seen on the underside of leaves. Tufts of white spores (sporodochia) may be seen along lesions. Heavily infected plants may lose leaves from the bottom of the canopy first leaving stems with a ""lion tail"" look. Propagation flats may have more blight toward the center than the margin of the flat.


","To limit spread and movement of the pathogen, all confirmed infected plants should be destroyed.

1) Isolate and contain new shipments of boxwood for a 30-day observation period. Locate the isolation area well away from existing blocks or outgoing shipments, and scout weekly.

2) Break up large blocks of  with non-host species to limit exposure and potential losses due to this disease.

3) Do not reuse or recycle or compost infected plants, media, or containers.

4) Scout all plants on a weekly basis, especially just after warm, wet weather. Limit activity in plantings during rainy and/or wet weather.

5) Remove and destroy dead leaves and plant debris from within and underneath plants. Flaming was only partially successful in reducing inoculum from under contaminated plants in Virginia. Also, prune off and destroy infected twigs.

6) Do not grow susceptible plants on ground that has been positive for this disease.

7) Disinfest pruning equipment, especially between blocks of plants. Labeled rates of bleach, Lysol, ZeroTol, Oxidate, and X3 have been effective. Disinfestants work better on clean equipment with long contact times.

8) Avoid overhead irrigation.

9) Space and prune (thin) plants for good air circulation. Thinning is best done in the fall during dry weather using sharp bypass pruners.

10) Grow tolerant species or cultivars but exercise caution to avoid inadvertently bringing in or shipping out infected plants.

11) Grow plants in well-drained media or soil with a pH between 6.8 and 7.5. Light shade of 20% can also reduce injury from summer and winter extremes.

12) Under severe landscape situations in Europe, Japanese holly () has been recommended as an alternative plant.

","Combine fungicide use with intensive scouting and cultural management. Curative applications will not effectively manage this disease even with the best products. Alternate or tank-mix products from different groups that have different modes of action. Use of tank-mixes or pre-packed mixes are preferred, especially using a multisite fungicide as one component of the mix. Test for phytotoxicity on a small group of plants or cultivars before widespread use, especially if surfactants are included in the mix. High rates of Group 3 materials may cause some marginal burning of leaves. Good coverage is essential but difficult to achieve with dense foliage. Dilute high-volume applications will provide better coverage than low-volume concentrate applications. Reduced sensitivity to Group 11 fungicides is suspected in Northeast America.
Weather data combined with disease modeling has indicated that many infections can occur on young growth in spring during rainy weather. The potential for fall infections of older leaves is also possible when rain returns in the autumn. Focus applications in the spring beginning at bud break and continuing with wet weather. Monitor weather in the fall and apply a fungicide if warm and wet weather is forecasted.
There are no fungicides in small, home packaging labeled for this disease. It is suggested that homeowners hire a reputable landscape company for management of high vale hedges and landscapes. Both cultural and chemical tactics must be used.

Boxwood ,(Buxus spp.)-Phytophthora Root and Crown Rot,"Phytophthora cinnamomi and P. parasitica, have been reported from the Eastern United States while P. citrophthora, P. cinnamomi and P. occultans have been found in Oregon nurseries. These are water molds, fungus-like microorganisms that cause root rot or crown rot in both container-grown and field-grown plants. The pathogen can remain in soil or potting media for extended periods and may infect subsequent crops of boxwood or other hosts such as rhododendron, pieris, and kalmia that are planted. Disease is favored by poor drainage and warm weather. Irrigation scheduling that promotes prolonged soil saturation can encourage disease development. Propagules can be carried in recycled irrigation water.


","Foliage wilts and turns gray-green to bronze to a dry brown color. Whole sections of the canopy may dry and brown as the disease progresses. Roots become brown and water-soaked. The cortex is rotted and falls off all but the larger roots. A chocolate-brown to black color develops from roots into the root crown and may extend a few centimeters above the soil. Infected plants generally die.


","

1) Avoid reusing pots from a previous crop. If pots must be reused then wash off all debris and soak in a sanitizing solution or treat with aerated steam for 30 min.

2) Provide good drainage for plants in beds, fields, or containers. Place containers on gravel beds (4 inches or more deep) to allow drainage. Do not place containers on poly sheets; they can prevent containers from draining and allow contaminated drainage water to spread from the base of one container to another.

3) Avoid planting in areas where boxwood and other  hosts have previously died.

4) Schedule irrigation to meet the water demands of the crop.

5) Grow plants in well-drained media or soil with a pH between 6.8 and 7.5. Light shade of 20% can also reduce injury from summer and winter extremes.

","Can be helpful but do not rely upon as sole means of disease control. Use fungicides as preventative treatments. The Group 4 and Group 33 fungicides used to manage Phytophthora do not kill this organism. They can only prevent establishment of the organism before it gets into the plant. They can also prevent continued growth if the organism is already inside the plant thereby delaying symptoms that might have developed. Once chemical activity has subsided with time, the organism can resume growth within infected plants. Rotate fungicides that have a different mode of action for resistance management.

Boxwood ,(Buxus spp.)-Volutella Leaf and Stem Blight (Canker),"Pseudonectria buxi (asexual: Volutella buxi), a fungus that survives in affected branches and leaves. Boxwood is susceptible to infection when subjected to wounds or winter injury. Optimal temperature for infection and disease development is 68°F to 77°F when relative humidity is 85% or greater. Infection often occurs at the bases of small dead shoots, or in crotches where leaves have accumulated, or through pruning wounds. One-month-old leaves were much more susceptible than 1-year-old leaves.
Most common cultivars such as Green Velvet, Green Gem, Green Mountain and Chicagoland Green are susceptible. 'Pincushion' has exhibited less disease in inoculation tests and at nurseries in Ontario, Canada, but no cultivars are immune.

Broccoli ,(Brassica oleracea)-Black Leg (Phoma Stem Canker),"Leptosphaeria maculans (syn. Plenodomus lingam, anamorph: Phoma lingam) is a fungus that can infect a range of cruciferous crops including broccoli. Host plants include Brassica crops (Brussels sprouts, cabbage, cauliflower, collards, canola, kale, mizuna, mustard greens, rutabaga, turnip, etc.), Sinapis (white and yellow mustard), and Raphanus (daikon and radish). Cruciferous weeds common in the Pacific Northwest can be host to black leg, including: birdsrape mustard (Brassica rapa), black mustard (B. nigra), western yellow cress or curvepod yellowcress (Rorippa curvisiliqua), tansymustard (Descurainia pinnata), hedge mustard (Sisymbrium officinale), tumble mustard (S. altissimum), small tumbleweed mustard (S. loeselii), pennycress (Thlaspi arvense), mouseear cress (Arabidopsis thaliana), annual wallrocket (Diplotaxis muralis), perennial wallrocket (D. tenuifolia), and wild radish (Raphanus raphanistrum). The fungus survives on living plants as pycnidia, which produce water-splashed pycnidiospores, or with plant debris as pycnidia and/or pseudothecia. Pseudothecia release ascospores that may be windborne long distances, at least several miles and perhaps further on storm fronts. The fungus survives with infected plant residues until the plant debris decomposes (up to 4 years). In fall-sown crops or winter weeds, new pseudothecia can form on dead portions of infected plants prior to plant death and pseudothecia continue forming on infected plant residues remaining on the soil surface after harvest. In spring-sown crops, pseudothecia do not form until after harvest, and their production on residues atop the soil typically starts the following fall after a couple of wet periods. Ascospores are released from the pseudothecia following wet or humid conditions and when mean temperatures are between 46°F and 59°F. Conditions conducive for ascospore production and release commonly occur during the fall, winter, and springtime throughout the Pacific Northwest. Trap plants deployed weekly in multiple sites around the Willamette Valley in western Oregon beginning in October 2014 and 2015, showed that the first ascospore infections occurred around mid-October. During 2015-2016, ascospore infections of trap plants occurred from mid-October into May with severe disease pressure during February and March. Wounding, insect injury, or herbicide injury can result in greater disease severity.
Two types of pycnidia (which produce asexual spores known as pycnidiospores) can be found; one on infected, live plants (thinner-walled pycnidium with a neck) and the other on crop residues (thicker-walled pycnidium with a narrow ostiole). Pycnidiospores are dispersed by splashing rain or irrigation water, so pycnidiospore movement is limited to relatively short distances, but pycnidiospores can add to the overall incidence and severity of disease within a field. Workers or equipment moving through infected plantings during wet conditions can spread disease.
Black leg can also move with infected seed, Leptosphaeria can survive for years in association with seed. But if, as a general practice, seed lots used for planting are Leptosphaeria-free then the spread of regional epidemics is thought to arise from infected plant debris. Even low levels of seed infection, when coupled with weather favorable for disease, can lead to severe losses, including stand die-out within a field. The Oregon Department of Agriculture requires that all crucifer seed, even half ounce or smaller packets, that is to be planted in Oregon must be accompanied by an official test showing that the untreated seed is free from black leg (Leptosphaeria species).
This disease can reduce seed crop yields. After a disease outbreak in a larger geographic area, the threat of seed yield loss in fall-sown crops is much greater due to the abundance of affected crop residues on the soil surface, especially if field-wide epidemics occurred in no-till production. Widespread leaf spot and subsequent black leg stem cankers can result from unprotected plants being exposed to ascospores released from infected crop residues. Replanting or allowing volunteers to grow in a field after a black leg outbreak can result in high numbers of infected seedlings by fall in western Oregon or Washington Brassica seed fields, perpetuating disease. Planting adjacent to a previously-infected field can also result in a high disease incidence (40% to 60%) in the new planting by December, while planting within a few miles of an infected residue site can result in generalized infections across new fields (1% to 5%). Researchers at OSU have observed uncontrolled black leg infections in fall-planted seed fields in western Oregon to increase from a low disease incidence (1% to 5%) to high (40% to 90% of the stand infected) in a 6-week period. Infections of fall-planted vegetable or seed fields can lead to stand losses through winter into the spring.


","Generalized leaf spots, becoming numerous across the field, have been observed in fall-planted crops after initial windblown spore (ascospore) infections. Pale, irregular spots develop on cotyledons, leaves, stems or petioles, later becoming somewhat circular to oval, ashy-gray colored with scattered tiny, black pycnidia. Sometimes the center of lesions will fall out, especially after heavy rain-fall, but a narrow, ashy-gray band with pycnidia usually remains. Stem lesions that develop after the fungus moves systemically are elongated with purple borders, often near the soil line, and may girdle the stem as well as decay pith tissues, and extend below the soil surface, causing a brown-to-gray to black rot in the lower stem and roots. Vascular tissues may turn black in color prior to exter-nal rot symptoms. Damping-off can occur if plants are infected at the seedling stage, usually through the use of infected seeds. Plants produced from infected seeds that survive the seedling stage are stunted and often develop a rot of the stem at or just below the soil line, which moves upwards and can cause plant death.
In seed crops, leaf spots may appear on over-wintered leaves at initially low levels but increase as pycnidiospores spread the leaf spot. As seed plants mature, they may fall sideways from lack of root anchorage or stem cankers may cause the top of the plant to fall over. Symptoms on seed pods are rare and inconspicuous. Black leg stem cankers in seed crops may be invaded by secondary pathogens, masking black leg symptoms on the stems of affected plants.


","

1) Plant only seed certified by official testing to be free of .

2) Avoid planting in or adjacent to a site where disease has occurred within the last 3 to 4 years; plantings within a quarter of a mile of a field containing black leg-infected crucifer residues are at high risk for developing black leg.

3) Delay spring plantings until the weather is drier to avoid periods of ascospore release.

4) Bury residues after harvest by deep plowing if possible, or remove plant debris. Multiple flailings (up to three) followed by a shallow incorporation may be sufficient depending on amount and size of plant debris as well as environmental conditions.

5) Control susceptible weeds and control volunteer crucifers.

6) Hot water seed treatment for 20 min. in water at 122°F (50°C).

7) For organic production removal of affected leaves, shortly after leaf spots develop, can reduce secondary spread within a planting as well as the incidence of stem cankers.

8) 

8.1) Seedbeds should not have crucifer crops on or near them for at least 5 years.
8.2) Transplants should not be dipped in water before transplanting.
8.3) Inspect seedbeds and seed fields for presence of the disease.
","Seed treatment and a foliar fungicide program will be essential if growing seed fields in any region where black leg epidemics have occurred across a larger geographic area. Infected seed can occur in seed lots, certified to be free of black leg, at levels below the detection threshold by seed testing, and chemical or hot water seed treatments will aid in controlling disease introduction by infected seed.


",
Broccoli ,(Brassica oleracea)-Clubroot,"The disease is caused by Plasmodiophora brassicae, a fungus-like microorganism that can survive in soil 18 years or more after an infected crop. It can be spread through any means that moves soil: wind and water, footwear and equipment, and in infected transplants. Soils that are cool, wet (70% to 80% water-holding capacity) and acidic favor the pathogen.
Clubroot probably affects all species of the Crucifer family, including wild mustard. There are races of the pathogen that infect certain host species. The microorganism that causes clubroot occurs worldwide and possibly infects plants in the rose, poppy, and grass families. However, these plants rarely show typical symptoms of the disease. Viable spores of Plasmodiophora brassicae were detected on canola, pea and wheat seeds as well as on potato tubers harvested from clubroot-infested fields in Alberta, Canada.


","The distinctive symptom is abnormally large roots-fine roots, secondary roots, the taproot, or even on the underground stem. Roots develop clubs (swellings) that can be 5 or 6 inches wide. The largest clubs usually are just below the soil surface on the larger roots. Affected seedlings will not show any root swellings until about 3 weeks after infection. When susceptible plants are attacked in the seedling stage, they can die. When plants are attacked at a later stage, the disease rarely kills, but roots that are severely distorted have a reduced capacity to absorb minerals and water from soil. Plants wilt in hot weather but partly recover at night. Consequently, top growth may be stunted, yellowish, and likely to prematurely bolt or to wilt in hot weather. But even with extensive root clubbing, top growth may be nearly normal.


","

1) Early infection of seedlings can result in severe symptoms; so it is important to use only uninfected seedbeds and clean transplant media, trays, and equipment.

2) Do not lime seedbeds or transplant-growing media heavily. It may mask the disease, which could flare up once seedlings are transplanted to a soil of lower pH.

3) Never allow drainage water or soil from an infested field to enter an irrigation source. Spores are moved easily in irrigation water.

4) Work in pathogen-free fields before moving people and machinery into infested fields. Thoroughly clean soil from machinery and equipment before moving from an infested field to a clean one.

5) If growing susceptible crops in suspect or infested fields, incorporate enough finely ground limestone the year before planting to raise the soil pH above 7. Use lime applications that increase soil pH as well as level of soil calcium. Thoroughly mix lime into the soil to maximize potential disease control. Lime inhibits disease development, but will not prevent a disease outbreak if the spore load in the soil is sufficiently high. Different soil types vary considerably in their response to efforts to alter the pH with lime. Therefore, measure the initial soil pH, follow Soil Moisture Potential (SMP) test recommendations, and monitor the changes after application. Periodically monitor the pH in subsequent years to determine the stability of the change.

6) If planting in a suspect or infected field, incorporating hydrated lime (1,500 lb/A) at least 6 weeks before planting, whether pH is neutral or alkaline, gives additional disease control.

7) Long rotations (6 years or longer) help prevent a pathogen buildup and reduce disease.

8) Control wild mustards if they are a weed problem.

9) The form of nitrogen fertilizer can also influence disease. Using calcium nitrate may result in less disease compared to ammonium sulfate or urea.

10) The cultivar Ore. CR-1 is resistant to some strains of the fungus.

11) If clubroot occurs, hilling-up plants can encourage production of adventitious roots, which may result in a better yield.

Broccoli ,(Brassica oleracea)-Damping-off,"The fungi or fungus-like microorganisms, Pythium spp., Fusarium spp. and Rhizoctonia solani, attack young seedlings of many vegetables including members of the genus Brassica. These soilborne microbes can persist indefinitely in soil or plant debris. If seedlings are affected before emergence, it appears as poor germination. If the decay is after emergence, seedlings that fall over and die have ""damping-off."" The destructiveness of this disease depends on the amount of pathogens in the soil and on environmental conditions. Cool, cloudy weather, wet soils, compacted soil, acidic soil, high humidity, and overcrowding are especially favorable for the development of damping-off.


","Young seedlings develop a sunken, necrotic lesion near the soil line. If the lesion girdles the stem, the seedling collapses and soon dies. Also, seeds may simply not emerge.


","

1) Use good quality seed.

2) In the greenhouse or seedbed, pasteurize the soil with heat. Use good sanitation in greenhouses.

3) Locate seedbeds on well-drained soil and avoid excessive irrigation.

4) Lime acid soils to get a pH of 6.5 or 7.0.

5) Space rows and/or seedlings in the seedbed to maximize air movement.

6) Carefully examine seedlings when transplanting, and discard any with signs of wirestem.

7) If damping-off occurs, stop watering for a while. Allow soil to dry somewhat around the plants. If the seedlings are in flats or in cold frames, give them as much air and light as possible.

8) Crop rotation with cereals may reduce pathogen populations in the soil.

9) Remove or encourage decomposition of plant debris.

Broccoli ,(Brassica oleracea)-Downy Mildew (Staghead),"Peronospora parasitica (= Hyaloperonospora parasitica), a fungus-like microorganism that overwinters in roots or infected plant debris, affects nearly all cultivated plants and weeds in the crucifer family. Several strains of the fungus; however, are specific to certain groupings of crops. High humidity, fog, drizzle, and heavy dew favor disease development and spread. Optimum conditions for disease development are night temperatures of 46°F to 61°F for 4 or more successive nights and day temperature approximately 75°F or lower. The systemic phase of the disease is the most destructive because it renders the heads useless for the freezing trade. All commercial-processing broccoli cultivars are very susceptible. In areas with mild, wet winters, such as western Oregon or Washington, downy mildew can continue infecting fall-planted seed crops during the winter months, although only small amount of the total leaf surface area may be colonized on individual leaves, but this allows for a build-up within a field, potentially leading to severe increase in infections of spring growth if spring conditions are wet and mild. Fall and spring downy-mildew management is important for fall-planted seed fields to avoid extensive staghead formation, where an inflorescence is abnormal in shape and development due to downy mildew or white rust. White rust and downy mildew are commonly found cohabitating together in leaf colonies on brassicas in western Oregon and elsewhere.


","The first observable symptom is small, light green-yellow lesions on the upper leaf surface, later showing on the undersurface. The spot turns yellow as it enlarges. In high humidity, a grayish-white fungal growth is on the leaf's underside.
Spots can be seen on the outsides of stalks. Streaks of brown to purple tissue, often in a net-necrosis pattern, are on the insides of stalks. These streaks may extend up to the small florets of the curd, stunting the curd. Streaking is difficult to detect without breaking the stalk for examination.
On fall-planted seed crops, downy mildew can create tiny leaf spots during the winter months or other times where small clusters of, even just a few, conidia and conidiophores are produced on the underside of the leaf surface; rarely in large enough quantity to be seen without magnification. During warmer rain breaks, individual lesions may rapidly enlarge and then quickly collapse with a secondary soft rot during rainy periods.  This can be confused for cold-damaged tissues with subsequent secondary leaf rot, which can also be common in areas of Oregon and Washington seed production during certain winters.
In seed crops, downy mildew on an inflorescence can lead to staghead formation, abnormal shape and development of the inflorescence due to downy mildew or white rust. White rust and downy mildew are commonly found together in leaf colonies on brassicas in western Oregon and elsewhere.

Broccoli ,(Brassica oleracea)-Light Leaf Spot,"The fungus, Cylindrosporium concentricum (sexual stage: Pyrenopeziza brassicae) has been found in Oregon on canola, turnip, radish, vegetable Brassica seed fields, and Brassica species used as cover crops during 2014. The disease was found during 2016 in the Skagit Valley of western Washington on Brassica cover crops and wild mustard. All Brassicas grown in the Pacific Northwest are probably susceptible but the specific host range within Brassicaceae is unknown at this time. Light leaf spot can also occur on weed plants including birdsrape mustard (B. rapa), black mustard (B. nigra), and wild radish (Raphanus raphanistrum). Oilseed rape and cauliflower are reported to be more susceptible than Brussels sprouts or kale, but there is a range of susceptibility within each crop species. The pathogen has been a problem on oilseed rape in various parts of the world with seed losses estimated at 22% when outbreaks have occurred in the United Kingdom. This disease hasn't been previously reported in North America though an infected Indian mustard field was found in western Oregon during 1998. Oilseed rape is very susceptible and losses results from stand die-out, reduced pod numbers, premature pod ripening, or an overall growth reduction with less severe infections. Brassicas grown as vegetables in other areas of the globe, where this disease has been reported, suffer blemish defects by relatively mild infections, causing a decrease in quality but not of yield quantity. Trichloroacetic acid-based herbicides may increase plant susceptibility by affecting the waxy layer of leaves.
Ascospores develop from apothecia on infected plant residues and can be wind-dispersed relatively long distances after a wetting period, infecting susceptible plants. Asexual spores (conidia) develop but spread relatively short distances by rain or splashing water, potentially causing pod infections during the following spring. Seed can be infected or casually infested with the asexual stage yet seed transmission occurs at very low rates due to rapid die-out of the pathogen on seed. Still, epidemics can be initiated by seedborne inoculum or from neighboring fields of infected plants or residues, or from infected volunteers. Wet conditions and cool temperatures (around 60°F is optimum) promote disease development. Fall-infected plants may remain symptomless through the winter season, till the following spring. Light leaf spot reappeared during late February in western Oregon, but ascospores probably began infecting during the previous October and November, possibly throughout the winter into the spring. Infections have been found in spring-planted fields.


","This fungus can attack leaves, stems and pods. Flecking may be observed on cotyledons while leaf infections start as discolored patches that develop into irregular brown lesions with cracked centers, sometimes turning black. Veins surrounding young lesions often take on an olive-brown hue and may exhibit deformities. Leaf lesions can coalesce, causing death of leaves. When leaves are infected young, distortion can develop. Stem lesions are superficial, elongated brownish streaks with grayish-black margins and can be mistaken for black leg, except decay does not affect the stem pith. Flower infections may cause abortion. Pods infected early appear distorted while pods infected later result in relatively healthy looking pods but will have white spore masses. Seedlings can be killed or plants may be stunted. Cauliflower will have a brown discoloration of curds while Brussels sprouts exhibit black lesions.

Broccoli ,(Brassica oleracea)-White Leaf Spot and Gray Stem,"The fungus, Pseudocercosporella capsellae (sexual stage: Mycosphaerella capsellae), has been observed in various Brassica vegetable and seed crops in Oregon. It has been reported in oilseed rape in the United Kingdom and Canada. Pod losses of 15% have been reported in Europe. Turnip, Chinese cabbage, mustards and oilseed rape are thought to be more susceptible than cabbage, cauliflower, broccoli and other vegetable Brassica species. Horseradish and radish are susceptible to white leaf spot as well as weedy types such as wild radish, wild mustard, and shepherd's purse.
Ascospores develop on infected Brassica or Raphanus residues during the autumn and possibly winter or spring months; these ascospores are wind-dispersed relatively long distances following rain or dew events. After a successful infection, asexual spores (conidia) subsequently develop in the leaf spots and are spread relatively short distances by rain or splashing water, causing secondary spread, including pod and seed infections. Seed transmission has not been reported to play a major role in disease outbreaks; infected crop residues are usually necessary for large-scale outbreaks, but seed transmission can lead to introduction of disease into new areas. Temperatures of 50°F to 60°F with moist conditions (rain, dew, or irrigation) promote disease development.


","This fungus can attack leaves, stems and pods. Tan, irregular or roundish spots develop on leave, especially leaf tips and edges, later becoming ashy-gray to white with a brownish margin and sometimes a yellowish halo. White conidia can be observed on the underside of leaf spots. Leaf spots will become dark brown as leaves senesce, due to the initiation of the sexual stage. The center of older lesions may fall out, resulting in a shot hole appearance. Lesions may coalesce when disease is severe, resulting in defoliation. Stem lesions are elongated and first brown, turning ashy-gray to white with a brownish margin and numerous tiny dark specks due to the formation of the sexual stage; there is a distinct boundary between diseased and healthy tissue on the stem. Gray stem lesions are superficial; the pith is not severely infected, helping to distinguish gray stem from black leg. Pod infections are at first small brown spots that expand and turn grayish-white with numerous tiny dark specks due to the formation of the sexual stage.

Brussels Sprouts ,(Brassica oleracea)-Bacterial Leaf Spot,"A bacterium, Pseudomonas syringae pv. maculicola, causes this disease, also known as bacterial leaf spot on cauliflower, broccoli, and Brussels sprouts. Bacteria survive on infested seed and crop residues as well as in soil. Cool, wet weather, common west of the Cascade Range, favors disease development before harvest in the fall.

Brussels Sprouts ,(Brassica oleracea)-Black Leg (Phoma Stem Canker),"Leptosphaeria maculans (syn. Plenodomus lingam, anamorph: Phoma lingam) is a fungus that can infect a range of cruciferous crops. Host plants include Brassica crops (broccoli, cabbage, califlower, collards, canola, kale, mizuna, mustard greens, rutabaga, turnip, etc.), Sinapis (white and yellow mustard), and Raphanus (daikon and radish). Cruciferous weeds common in the Pacific Northwest can be host to black leg, including birdsrape mustard (Brassica rapa), black mustard (B. nigra), western yellow cress or curvepod yellowcress (Rorippa curvisiliqua), tansymustard (Descurainia pinnata), hedge mustard (Sisymbrium officinale), tumble mustard (S. altissimum), small tumbleweed mustard (S. loeselii), pennycress (Thlaspi arvense), mouseear cress (Arabidopsis thaliana), annual wallrocket (Diplotaxis muralis), perennial wallrocket (D. tenuifolia), and wild radish (Raphanus raphanistrum). The fungus survives on living plants as pycnidia, which produce water-splashed pycnidiospores, or with plant debris as pycnidia and/or pseudothecia. Pseudothecia release ascospores that may be windborne long distances, at least several miles and perhaps further on storm fronts. The fungus survives in association with infected plant residues until the plant debris decomposes (up to 4 years). In fall-sown crops or winter weeds, new pseudothecia can form on dead portions of infected plants prior to harvest and continue forming on the infected plant residues remaining on the soil surface after harvest. In spring-sown crops, pseudothecia do not form until after harvest, and their production on residues atop the soil typically starts the following fall after a couple of wet periods. When residues are on the soil surface, ascospores are released from the pseudothecia following wet or humid conditions and when mean temperatures are between 46°F and 59°F. Conditions conducive for ascospore production and release commonly occur during the fall, winter, and springtime throughout the Pacific Northwest. Trap plants deployed weekly in multiple sites around the Willamette Valley in western Oregon beginning in October 2014 and 2015, showed that ascospore infections began around mid-October. During 2015-2016, ascospore infections of trap plants occurred from mid-October into May with severe disease pressure during February and March. Wounding, insect injury, or herbicide injury can result in greater disease severity.
Two types of pycnidia (which produce asexual spores known as pycnidiospores) can be found; one on infected, live plants (thinner-walled pycnidium with a neck) and the other on crop residues (thicker-walled pycnidium with a narrow ostiole). Pycnidiospores are dispersed by splashing rain or irrigation water, so pycnidiospore movement is limited to relatively short distances, but pycnidiospores can add to the overall incidence and severity of disease within a field. Workers or equipment moving through infected plantings during wet conditions also spread disease.
Black leg can also move with infected seed, Leptosphaeria can survive for years in association with seed. But if, as a general practice, seed lots used for planting are Leptosphaeria-free then the spread of regional epidemics is thought to arise from infected plant debris.  Even low levels of seed infection, when coupled with weather favorable for disease, can lead to severe losses, including stand die-out within a field. The Oregon Department of Agriculture requires that all crucifer seed, even half ounce or smaller packets, that is to be planted in Oregon must be accompanied by an official test showing that the untreated seed is free from black leg (Leptosphaeria species).
This disease can reduce seed and vegetable crop yields. After a disease outbreak in a larger geographic area, the threat of seed yield loss in fall-sown crops is much greater due to the abundance of affected crop residues on the soil surface, especially if field-wide epidemics occurred in no-till fields. Widespread leaf spot and subsequent black leg stem cankers can result from unprotected plants being exposed to ascospores released from infected crop residues. Replanting or allowing volunteers to grow in a field after a black leg outbreak can result in high numbers of infected seedlings by fall in western Oregon or Washington Brassica seed fields, perpetuating disease. Planting adjacent to a previously-infected field can also result in a high disease incidence (40 to 60%) in the new planting by December, while planting within a few miles of an infected residue site can result in generalized infections across new fields (1 to 5%). Researchers at OSU have observed uncontrolled black leg infections in fall-planted seed fields in western Oregon to increase from a low disease incidence (1 to 5%) to high (40 to 90% of the stand infected) in a 6-week period. Infections of fall-planted vegetable or seed fields can lead to stand losses through winter into the spring.


","Generalized leaf spots, becoming numerous across the field, have been observed in fall-planted crops after initial wind-blown spore (ascospore) infections. Pale, irregular spots develop on cotyledons, leaves, stems or petioles, later becoming somewhat circular to oval, ashy-gray colored with scattered black pycnidia. Sometimes the center of lesions will fall out, especially after heavy rainfall, but a narrow, ashy-gray band with pycnidia usually remains. Stem cankers develop after the fungus grows systemically down the plant from initial lea spots and are elongated with purple-black borders. Cankers often develop near the soil line, may girdle the stem as well as decay pith tissues, and extend below the soil surface, causing a brown-to-gray to black rot in the lower stem and roots. Vascular tissues turn black in color prior to development of external black leg symptoms. Damping-off can occur if plants are infected at the seedling stage, usually through the use of infected seeds. Plants produced from infected seeds that survive the seedling stage are stunted and often develop a rot of the stem at or just below the soil line, which moves upwards and can cause plant death.
In seed crops, leaf spots may appear on over-wintered leaves at initially low levels but increase as pycnidiospores spread the leaf spot. As seed plants mature, they may fall sideways from lack of root anchorage or stem cankers may cause the top of the plant to fall over. Symptoms on seed pods are rare and inconspicuous. Black leg stem cankers in seed crops may be invaded by secondary pathogens, masking black leg symptoms on the stems of affected plants.


","

1) Plant only seed certified by official testing to be free of .

2) Avoid planting in or adjacent to a site where disease has occurred within the last 3 to 4 years; plantings within a quarter of a mile of a field containing black leg-infected crucifer residues are at high risk for developing black leg.

3) Delay spring plantings until the weather is drier to avoid periods of ascospore release.

4) Bury residues after harvest by deep plowing if possible, or remove plant debris. Multiple flailings (up to three) followed by a shallow incorporation may be sufficient depending on amount and size of plant debris as well as environmental conditions

5) Control susceptible weeds and control volunteer crucifers.

6) Hot water seed treatment for 25 min. in water at 122°F (50°C).

7) For organic production, removal of affected leaves shortly after leaf spots develop, can reduce secondary spread within a planting as well as the incidence of stem cankers.

8) 

8.1) Seedbeds should not have crucifer crops on or near them for at least 5 years.
8.2) Transplants should not be dipped in water before transplanting.
8.3) Inspect seedbeds and seed fields for presence of the disease.
","Seed treatment and a foliar fungicide program will be essential if growing seed fields in any region where black leg epidemics have occurred across a larger geographic area. Infected seed can occur in seed lots, certified to be free of black leg, at levels below the detection threshold by seed testing, and chemical or hot water seed treatments will aid in controlling disease introduction by infected seed.

","Symptoms generally are not noticeable until late in the growing season when sprouts are quite mature. The first symptoms are small, black lesions, which, with high humidity and warm weather, rapidly expand and coalesce, completely rotting outer leaves on the bottom sprouts. The entire leaf tissue of the infected sprouts may rot, yet the main stalk, stem, and core of each sprout do not become diseased.

Brussels Sprouts ,(Brassica oleracea)-White Leaf Spot and Gray Stem,"The fungus, Pseudocercosporella capsellae (sexual stage: Mycosphaerella capsellae), has been observed in various Brassica vegetable and seed crops in Oregon. It has been reported in oilseed rape in the United Kingdom and Canada. Pod losses of 15% have been reported in Europe. Turnip, Chinese cabbage, mustards and oilseed rape are thought to be more susceptible than cabbage, cauliflower, broccoli and other vegetable Brassica species. Horseradish and radish are susceptible to white leaf spot as well as weedy types such as wild radish, wild mustard, and shepherd's purse.
Ascospores develop on infected Brassica or Raphanus residues during the autumn and possibly winter or spring months; these ascospores are wind-dispersed relatively long distances following rain or dew events. After a successful infection, asexual spores (conidia) subsequently develop in the leaf spots and are spread relatively short distances by rain or splashing water, causing secondary spread, including pod and seed infections. Seed transmission has not been reported to play a major role in disease outbreaks; infected crop residues are usually necessary for large-scale outbreaks, but seed transmission can lead to introduction of disease into new areas. Temperatures of 50°F to 60°F with moist conditions (rain, dew, or irrigation) promote disease development.


","This fungus can attack leaves, stems and pods. Tan, irregular or roundish spots develop on leave, especially leaf tips and edges, later becoming ashy-gray to white with a brownish margin and sometimes a yellowish halo. White conidia can be observed on the underside of leaf spots. Leaf spots will become dark brown as leaves senesce, due to the initiation of the sexual stage. The center of older lesions may fall out, resulting in a shot hole appearance. Lesions may coalesce when disease is severe, resulting in defoliation. Stem lesions are elongated and first brown, turning ashy-gray to white with a brownish margin and numerous tiny dark specks due to the formation of the sexual stage; there is a distinct boundary between diseased and healthy tissue on the stem. Gray stem lesions are superficial; the pith is not severely infected, helping to distinguish gray stem from black leg. Pod infections are at first small brown spots that expand and turn grayish-white with numerous tiny dark specks due to the formation of the sexual stage.

Buckwheat ,"(Fagopyrum esculentum, F. tataricum)-Curly Top","Beet curly top virus (BCTV) which can affect a wide range of crops including beet, tomato, cucurbits, beans, etc. and non-crop plants. Symptomatic buckwheat crops have been observed in Washington for several years, and have tested positive for BCTV based on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays. It is transmitted by beet leafhopper feeding on plants, so it is not uncommon to observe healthy plants next to severely affected plants. Because the beet leafhopper feeds preferentially on other crops and weeds, the virus appears randomly through buckwheat crops but a higher incidence of infection may occur on field margins.


","Infected plants initially show unthrifty growth and small, misshapen leaves at the stem terminals. Plants become stunted and leaves become chlorotic and/or red. Stem terminals may lose leaves and become necrotic and shriveled, which can be mistaken for a fungal or bacterial infection. In severe cases, infected plants lose all leaves, leaving only the shriveled brown stem. The root system may decline and roots may rot from secondary fungal infections, but BCTV infection alone does not cause root rot. Severity of symptoms depends on how young plants are once they become infected. Plants infected at a more mature growth stage may show only yellowing or reddening of the leaves. Once infected, plants stop growing, produce no seed, and may die prematurely.


","

1) Sow new plantings in early spring or later season so seedling stage occurs before or after peak beet leafhopper migration.

2) No buckwheat cultivars have been evaluated for curly top resistance but when  and  were planted side-by-side, symptoms were worse in .

Cabbage ,(Brassica sp.)-Tip Burn,"This is a physiological disorder. High fertility and high temperatures aggravate the disorder. Some research indicates it may be influenced by an imbalance of nitrogen, potassium, and calcium. Water stress followed by a period of excessive growth and low humidity favors development of tip burn. These conditions influence calcium uptake and distribution in the cabbage head. Amount and frequency of irrigation appear to influence incidence of tip burn. All cabbage cultivars grown in Oregon are susceptible to some degree with some differences between cultivars.


","A marginal necrosis of internal leaves. Symptoms can extend from a few small, brown spots on interior leaf edges to large areas of the leaf margin turning brown and eventually decaying. External symptoms usually are absent.


","No completely effective controls are known.

1) Holding nitrogen levels as low as possible commensurate with adequate yields is helpful. Nitrogen rates should not exceed 100 lb/A. The form of nitrogen may be important; ammonium forms are less desirable than nitrate forms.

2) Do not apply excessive rates of potash or other nutrients that would compete with calcium uptake.

3) Soil samples should show adequate base saturation and adequate levels of calcium.

4) Use adequate irrigation to avoid water stress conditions that would interfere with calcium movement to inner leaves.

5) Harvest cabbage at optimum maturity to avoid its becoming excessively firm.

6) Grow tolerant varieties. Research in New York rated cultivar susceptibility as follows:Slightly susceptible cabbage cultivars: Superdane, Falcon, Hinova, Atria, Rudolfo, Superkraut, Krautpaker.More susceptible cabbage cultivars: Titanic 90, Roundup, Bravo, Krautking, Little Rock.Quite susceptible cultivars: King Cole, Quisto, Superette.Very susceptible cabbage cultivars: Green Boy, Rio Verde, Condor, Izalco.

Cabbage and Cauliflower ,(Brassica sp.)-Black Leg (Phoma Stem Canker),"Leptosphaeria maculans (syn. Plenodomus lingam, anamorph: Phoma lingam) is a fungus that can infect a range of cruciferous crops. Host plants include Brassica species (broccoli, Brussels sprouts, collards, canola, kale, mizuna, mustard greens, rutabaga, turnip, etc.), Sinapis (white and yellow mustard), and Raphanus (daikon and radish). Cruciferous weeds common in the Pacific Northwest can be host to black leg, including: birdsrape mustard (Brassica rapa), black mustard (B. nigra), western yellow cress or curvepod yellowcress (Rorippa curvisiliqua), tansymustard (Descurainia pinnata), hedge mustard (Sisymbrium officinale), tumble mustard (S. altissimum), small tumbleweed mustard (S. loeselii), pennycress (Thlaspi arvense), mouseear cress (Arabidopsis thaliana), annual wallrocket (Diplotaxis muralis), perennial wallrocket (D. tenuifolia), and wild radish (Raphanus raphanistrum). The fungus survives on living plants as pycnidia, which produce water-splashed pycnidiospores, or with plant debris as pycnidia and/or pseudothecia. Pseudothecia release ascospores that may be windborne long distances, at least several miles and perhaps further on storm fronts. The fungus survives in association with infected plant residues until the plant debris decomposes (up to 4 years). In fall-sown crops or winter weeds, new pseudothecia can form on dead portions of infected plants prior to plant death and continue forming on infected residues remaining on the soil surface after harvest. In spring-sown crops, pseudothecia do not form on dead portions until after harvest, and their production on residues atop the soil typically starts the following fall after a couple of wet periods. Ascospores are released from the pseudothecia following wet or humid conditions and when mean temperatures are between 46°F and 59°F. Conditions conducive for ascospore production and release commonly occur during the fall, winter, and springtime throughout the Pacific Northwest. Trap plants deployed weekly in multiple sites around the Willamette Valley in western Oregon beginning in October 2014 and 2015, showed that the first ascospore infections occurred around mid-October. During 2015-2016, ascospore infections of trap plants occurred from mid-October into May with severe disease pressure during February and March. Wounding, insect injury, or herbicide injury can result in greater disease severity.
Two types of pycnidia (which produce asexual spores known as pycnidiospores) can be found; one on infected, live plants (thinner-walled pycnidium with a neck) and the other on crop residues (thicker-walled pycnidium with a narrow ostiole). Pycnidiospores are dispersed by splashing rain or irrigation water, so pycnidiospore movement is limited to relatively short distances, but pycnidiospores can add to the overall incidence and severity of disease build-up within a field. Workers or equipment moving through infected plantings during wet conditions can spread disease.
Black leg can also move with infected seed, Leptosphaeria can survive for years in association with seed. But if, as a general practice, seed lots used for planting are Leptosphaeria-free then the spread of regional epidemics is thought to arise from infected plant debris. Even low levels of seed infection, when coupled with weather favorable for disease, can lead to severe losses, including stand die-out within a field. The Oregon Department of Agriculture requires that all crucifer seed, even half ounce or smaller packets, that is to be planted in Oregon must be accompanied by an official test showing that the untreated seed is free from black leg (Leptosphaeria species).
This disease can reduce vegetable and seed yields. After a disease outbreak in a larger geographic area, the threat of seed yield loss in fall-sown crops is much greater due to the abundance of affected crop residues on the soil surface, especially if field-wide epidemics occurred in no-till production. Widespread leaf spot and subsequent black leg stem cankers can result from unprotected plants being exposed to ascospores released from infected crop residues. Replanting or allowing volunteers to grow in a field after a black leg outbreak can result in high numbers of infected seedlings by fall in western Oregon or Washington Brassica seed fields, perpetuating disease. Planting adjacent to a previously-infected field can result in a high disease incidence (40 to 60%) in a new planting by December while planting within a few miles of an infected residue site can result in generalized infections across new fields (1 to 5%). Researchers at OSU have observed uncontrolled black leg infections in fall-planted seed fields in western Oregon increase from a low disease incidence (1% to5%) to high (40% to 90% of the stand infected) in a 6-week period. Infections of fall-planted vegetable or seed fields can lead to stand losses through winter into the spring. Secondary diseases are common on plants with black leg; Sclerotinia, Botrytis, and soft rot bacteria are especially common on black leg-infected plants in western Oregon during rainy weather and may mask black leg infections by six weeks later.


","Generalized leaf spots, becoming numerous across the field, have been observed in fall-planted crops after initial windblown spore (ascospore) infections. Pale, irregular spots develop on cotyledons, leaves, stems or petioles, later becoming somewhat circular to oval, ashy-gray colored with scattered tiny, black pycnidia. Sometimes the center of lesions will fall out, especially after heavy rain-fall, but a narrow, ashy-gray band with pycnidia usually remains. The lower leaves of cabbage will typically have leaf spots that develop on the underside. Stem cankers develop after the fungus grows systemically down the plant from initial leaf spots and are elongated with purple-black borders in cauliflower but less distinct on cabbage. Stem cankers typically develop at the soil line, and may girdle the stem as well as decay pith tissues, and extend below the soil surface, causing a brown-to-gray to black rot in the lower stem and roots. Vascular tissues may turn black in color prior to development of external black leg symptoms. Damping-off can occur if plants are infected at the seedling stage, usually through the use of infected seeds. Plants produced from infected seeds that survive the seedling stage are stunted and often develop a rot of the stem at or just below the soil line, which moves upwards and can cause plant death.
In seed crops, leaf spots may appear on over-wintered leaves at initially low levels but increase as pycnidiospores spread the leaf spot. Affected plants in cabbage seed fields often die. In some cabbage seed crops, stem lesions can appear as nondescript, callused areas with thin vertical cracks that lack typical blackish coloration. Symptoms on seed pods are rare and inconspicuous. Black leg on cabbage is often invaded by secondary pathogens, masking black leg symptoms on affected seed plants.

1) Plant only seed certified by official testing to be free of .

2) Avoid planting in or adjacent to a site where disease has occurred within the last 3 to 4 years; plantings within a quarter of a mile of a field containing black leg-infected crucifer residues are at high risk for developing black leg.

3) Delay spring plantings until the weather is drier to avoid periods of ascospore release.

4) Bury residues after harvest by deep plowing if possible, or remove plant debris. Multiple flailings (up to three passes) followed by a shallow incorporation may be sufficient depending on amount and size of plant debris as well as environmental conditions.

5) Control susceptible weeds and control volunteer crucifers.

6) Hot water seed treatment for 25 min. in water at 122°F (50°C) for cabbage, 20 min. for cauliflower.

7) For organic production, removal of affected leaves shortly after leaf spots develop, can reduce secondary spread within a planting as well as the incidence of stem cankers.

8) 

8.1) Seedbeds should not have crucifer crops on or near them for at least 5 years.
8.2) Inspect seedbeds for foliar infections.
8.3) Transplants, if lifted, should not be dipped in water before transplanting.
8.4) Inspect seed fields for presence of the disease.
","Seed treatment and a foliar fungicide program will be essential if growing seed fields in any region where black leg epidemics have occurred across a larger geographic area. Infected seed can occur in seed lots, certified to be free of black leg, at levels below the detection threshold by seed testing, and chemical or hot water seed treatments will aid in controlling disease introduced by infected seed.

Cabbage and Cauliflower ,(Brassica sp.)-Black Rot,"Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris is a bacterium that overwinters in plant refuse for up to 2 years and is carried internally and externally on seed. The bacterium infects other crucifer crops and weeds. It may be spread in the field by water (rain, irrigation), insects, equipment, and animals. Many outbreaks can be attributed to disease spread in the seedbed. When spread by water, bacteria enter water pores (hydathodes) at leaf margins or occasionally through insect or other mechanical injuries. From the leaf, the infection proceeds up and down the main stem and then becomes systemic. Disease development may stop in unfavorable weather only to resume when conditions are favorable. Optimum temperatures for development are 80°F to 86°F. Water in the form of dew, rain, or sprinkler irrigation is necessary for spread.


","Tissues at leaf margins become yellow; chlorosis progresses toward the leaf center, creating a V-shaped area with the base of the ""V"" at the leaf midrib. Veins in these areas become dark brown or black; when the leaf is held up to a strong light source, they show up as a black net. Vascular tissue of the main stem then becomes blackened. As the infection becomes systemic, symptoms (the same as those found from direct infection) may appear anywhere on the plant. Unilateral stunting of some leaves occurs. In infected seed, the first symptoms appear on cotyledons, which rapidly wilt and drop off; usually however, the infection has reached the stem and proceeds up.

"
Cabbage and Cauliflower ,(Brassica sp.)-Clubroot,"The disease is caused by Plasmodiophora brassicae, a fungus-like microorganism that can survive in soil 18 years or more after an infected crop. It can be spread through any means that moves soil: wind and water, footwear and equipment, and in infected transplants. Soils that are cool, wet (70% to 80% water-holding capacity) and acidic favor the pathogen.
Clubroot probably affects all species of the cruciferous group, including wild mustard, but cabbage is among the most susceptible group members to clubroot. There are races within the clubroot pathogen population; certain strains of clubroot vary in the range of cruciferous species affected. The microorganism that causes clubroot occurs worldwide and also possibly infects plants in the rose, poppy, or grass families, including Creeping bent grass, orchardgrass, and perennial ryegrass. However, these plants rarely show typical symptoms of the disease. Viable spores of Plasmodiophora brassicae were detected on canola, pea and wheat seeds as well as on potato tubers harvested from clubroot-infested fields in Alberta, Canada.
Clubroot survival in composting is dependent upon not only temperature but also moisture levels. If there are dry pockets (<40% moisture) in hot composting, clubroot spores have a high probability of surviving under those conditions. Incubation of compost at 60% moisture and 50°C for 7 days or 24 hours at 60°C have been shown to prevent clubroot survival.


","The distinctive symptom is abnormally large roots-fine roots, secondary roots, the taproot, or even on the underground stem. Roots develop clubs (swellings) that can be 5 or 6 inches wide. The largest clubs usually are just below the soil surface on the larger roots. Affected seedlings will not show any root swellings until about 3 weeks after infection. When susceptible plants are attacked in the seedling stage, they can die, and infections at this stage can cause dramatic yield impacts as surviving plants can be dramatically stunted. When plants are attacked at a later stage, the disease rarely kills, but roots that are severely distorted have a reduced capacity to absorb minerals and water from soil. Plants wilt in hot weather but partly recover at night. Consequently, top growth may be stunted, yellowish, and likely to prematurely bolt or to wilt in hot weather. But even with extensive root clubbing, top growth may be nearly normal with close cultural management.


","Optimal management of clubroot includes planting seed or noninfected transplants in noninfested soil.

1) Plant in pathogen-free fields.

2) . Use only uninfected seedbeds and clean transplant media, trays, and equipment when producing transplants. Reused trays have been reported to be at high risk for pathogen contamination, especially if they have been in contact with the ground. If seedbeds have shown disease, soil fumigation is recommended if transplant production is continued. Do not mask the disease in transplant production with heavy lime applications to seedbeds or transplant-growing media. Disease will show once seedlings are transplanted to a soil of lower pH.

3) Long rotations (6 years or longer) help prevent a pathogen buildup and can reduce disease if susceptible weedy hosts are managed throughout the rotation.

4) If growing susceptible crops in suspect or infested fields, incorporate enough finely ground limestone the year before planting to raise the soil pH to at least 7. Use lime applications that increase soil pH as well as level of soil calcium. Thoroughly mix lime into the soil to maximize potential disease control. Lime inhibits disease development, but will not prevent a disease outbreak if the spore load in the soil is sufficiently high. Different soil types vary considerably in their response to efforts to alter the pH with lime. Therefore, measure the initial soil pH, follow Soil Moisture Potential (SMP) test recommendations, and monitor the changes after application.  monitor the pH in subsequent years to determine the stability of the change.

5) If planting in a suspect or infected field, incorporate hydrated lime (1,500 lb/A) at least 6 weeks before planting, whether pH is neutral or alkaline, to get a bigger boost in disease control.

6) The form of nitrogen fertilizer can also influence disease. Using calcium nitrate may result in less disease compared to ammonium sulfate or urea.

7) Control wild mustards if they are a weed problem.

8) If clubroot occurs, hilling-up plants can encourage production of adventitious roots, which may result in a better yield.

9) Work in pathogen-free fields before moving into infested fields. Thoroughly clean soil from machinery and equipment.

10) Protect irrigation sources from infected fields, prevent water or soil flow from an infested field into an irrigation source. Spores are moved easily in water, including winter rains.

11) The cabbage variety 'Badger Shipper' offers resistance to some races of the disease. Clubroot-resistant cauliflower is also available.

Cabbage and Cauliflower ,(Brassica sp.)-Damping-off (Wirestem),"The fungi or fungus-like microorganisms, Pythium spp., Fusarium spp., and Rhizoctonia solani, attack young seedlings of many vegetables, including members of the genus Brassica. These soilborne microorganisms can persist indefinitely in soil or plant debris. If seedlings are affected before emergence, it appears as poor germination. If the decay is after emergence, seedlings that fall over or die are said to ""damp-off."" The destructiveness of the disease depends on the amount of pathogen in the soil and on environmental conditions. Cool, cloudy weather, high humidity, wet soils, compacted soil, and overcrowding especially favor development of damping-off.


","Damping-off kills seedlings before or soon after they emerge. Beneath the soil a general rot is observed. Seedlings that emerge develop a lesion near where the tender stem contacts the soil surface, and the seedling collapses. In some cases, the seedling may continue to grow even though the lesion girdles the stem. The lesion is quite sunken, and the stem resembles a wire, hence the name wirestem. The girdled seedling eventually dies.


","

1) In the greenhouse or seedbed, pasteurize the soil with heat. Use good sanitation in greenhouses.

2) Locate seedbeds on well-drained soil, and avoid excessive irrigation.

3) Space rows and/or seedlings in the seedbed to maximize air movement.

4) Carefully examine seedlings when transplanting; discard any with signs of wirestem.

5) If damping-off occurs, stop watering for a while. Allow soil to dry somewhat around the plants. If the seedlings are in flats or in cold frames, give them as much air and light as possible.

6) Crop rotation with cereals may reduce pathogen populations in the soil.

7) Remove or encourage decomposition of plant debris.

Cabbage and Cauliflower ,(Brassica sp.)-Downy Mildew (Staghead),"Peronospora parasitica (= Hyaloperonospora parasitica), a fungus-like microorganism that overwinters in roots or infected plant debris and affects nearly all cultivated and weed plants in the Crucifer family. Several strains of the microorganism; however, are specific to certain groupings of crops. For example, the radish strain causes little damage to cabbage. Spores may be spread as contaminants on seeds. There is no proof that the fungus enters the seed. High humidity, fog, drizzling rains, and heavy dew favor disease development and spread. Optimum conditions for disease development are night temperatures of 46°F to 61°F for 4 or more successive nights, and day temperature about 75°F or lower. In areas with mild, wet winters, such as western Oregon or Washington, downy mildew can continue infecting fall-planted seed crops during the winter months, although only small amount of the total leaf surface area may be colonized on individual leaves, but this allows for a build-up within a field, potentially leading to severe increase in infections of spring growth if spring conditions are wet and mild. Fall and spring downy-mildew management is important for fall-planted seed fields to avoid extensive staghead formation, where an inflorescence is abnormal in shape and development due to downy mildew or white rust. White rust and downy mildew are commonly found cohabitating together in leaf colonies on brassicas in western Oregon and elsewhere.
Resistance is being incorporated into commercial cultivars, but at present no resistant commercial cultivars are available.


","The first observable symptom is small, light green-yellow lesions on the upper leaf surface, later showing on the undersurface. The spots turn yellow as they enlarge. During periods of high humidity, a grayish white moldy growth appears on the leaf's underside. Later the leaf may become papery and die. Cabbage heads develop sunken black spots, which may be minute or larger than 1 inch in diameter. Frequently, some plants become systemically infected in the seedling stage, but the black streaking and discoloration in leaves and heads does not become apparent until near harvest.
On fall-planted seed crops, downy mildew can create tiny leaf spots during the winter months or other times where small clusters of, even just a few, conidia and conidiophores are produced on the underside of the leaf surface; rarely in large enough quantity to be seen without magnification. During warmer rain breaks, individual lesions may rapidly enlarge and then quickly collapse with a secondary soft rot during rainy periods.  This can be confused for cold-damaged tissues with subsequent secondary leaf rot, which can also be common in areas of Oregon and Washington seed production during certain winters.
In seed crops, downy mildew on an inflorescence can lead to staghead formation, abnormal shape and development of the inflorescence due to downy mildew or white rust.  White rust and downy mildew are commonly found together in leaf colonies on brassicas in western Oregon and elsewhere.

Cabbage and Cauliflower ,(Brassica sp.)-Light Leaf Spot,"The fungus, Cylindrosporium concentricum (sexual stage: Pyrenopeziza brassicae) has been found in Oregon on canola, turnip, radish, black mustard, vegetable Brassica seed fields, and Brassica species used as cover crops during 2014. The disease was found during 2016 in the Skagit Valley of western Washington on Brassica cover crops and wild mustard. All Brassicas grown in the Pacific Northwest are probably susceptible but the specific host range within Brassicaceae is unknown at this time. Light leaf spot can also occur on weed plants including birdsrape mustard (B. rapa), black mustard (B. nigra), and wild radish (Raphanus raphanistrum). Oilseed rape and cauliflower are reported to be more susceptible than Brussels sprouts or kale, but there is a range of susceptibility within each crop species. The pathogen has been a problem on oilseed rape in various parts of the world with seed losses estimated at 22% when outbreaks have occurred in the United Kingdom. This disease hasn't been previously reported in North America though an infected Indian mustard field was found in western Oregon during 1998. Oilseed rape is very susceptible and losses results from stand die-out, reduced pod numbers, premature pod ripening, or an overall growth reduction with less severe infections. Brassicas grown as vegetables in other areas of the globe, where this disease has been reported, suffer blemish defects by relatively mild infections, causing a decrease in quality but not of yield quantity. Trichloroacetic acid-based herbicides may increase plant susceptibility by affecting the waxy layer of leaves.
Ascospores develop from apothecia on infected plant residues and can be wind-dispersed relatively long distances after a wetting period, infecting susceptible plants. Asexual spores (conidia) develop but spread relatively short distances by rain or splashing water, potentially causing pod infections during the following spring. Seed can be infected or casually infested with the asexual stage yet seed transmission occurs at very low rates due to rapid die-out of the pathogen on seed. Still, epidemics can be initiated by seedborne inoculum or from neighboring fields of infected plants or residues, or from infected volunteers. Wet conditions and cool temperatures (around 60°F is optimum) promote disease development. Fall-infected plants may remain symptomless through the winter season till the following spring. Light leaf spot reappeared during late February in western Oregon, but ascospores probably began infecting during the previous October and November, possibly throughout the winter into the spring. Infections have been found in spring-planted fields.


","This fungus can attack leaves, stems and pods. Flecking may be observed on cotyledons while leaf infections start as discolored patches that develop into irregular brown lesions with cracked centers, sometimes turning black. Veins surrounding young lesions often take on an olive-brown hue and may exhibit deformities. Leaf lesions can coalesce, causing death of leaves. When leaves are infected young, distortion can develop. Stem lesions are superficial, elongated brownish streaks with grayish-black margins and can be mistaken for black leg, except decay does not affect the stem pith. Flower infections may cause abortion. Pods infected early appear distorted while pods infected later result in relatively healthy looking pods but will have white spore masses. Seedlings can be killed or plants may be stunted. Cauliflower will have a brown discoloration of curds.


","

1) Rotate out of crucifers for 3 years.

2) Avoid planting adjacent to a field infected the previous season.

3) Control susceptible weeds and volunteer  plants.

4) Remove plant debris or bury by deep-plowing, important for preventing sexual recombinants from developing with new virulence or fungicide resistance. Flailing followed by a shallow incorporation may be sufficient depending on amount and size of plant debris as well as environmental conditions.

Cabbage and Cauliflower ,"(Brassica sp.)-Nematode, Cyst","Cyst nematodes (Heterodera schachtii) are sedentary endoparasites.


","First field symptom is the appearance of small, conspicuous areas where plants are stunted. Later in the season, these areas are marked by absence of plants and presence of weed patches. In severely infested fields, areas of decline usually can be identified by excessive leaf wilting during hot weather. Affected areas increase in size with continuous cropping of host crops.
Infected plants are much smaller than normal ones. Frequently, they have a dense system of secondary roots, called a hairy-root condition. Examination with a hand lens usually shows numerous small, white, bead-like structures on roots of infected plants. These structures are lemon-shaped and later become cysts containing eggs that develop into future generations of nematodes.


","

1) Crop rotation is an effective way to reduce nematode population because the pest has a narrow host range. In addition to sugar beets, other hosts are mangel-wurzel, table beet, cabbage, cauliflower, Brussels sprouts, broccoli, rape, turnip, rutabaga, and radish. Weed hosts are dock, knotweed, lambsquarters, mustard, nightshade, purslane, saltbush, and red root. Any of these that survive from year to year may act as reservoirs for the pests, counteracting much of the value of crop rotation. Crops that may be used in a short-term rotation include beans, sweet clover, corn, grains, peas, potatoes, and tomatoes. Alfalfa is suitable for a long rotation period. Length of rotation period should vary with severity of nematode infection. Slight infestations may require only a 2-year program; severe infestations require a 5- to 6-year interval between host crops.

2) Do not return crop refuse to fields that may be used for host crops in the future.

","Soil fumigation.

Cabbage and Cauliflower ,(Brassica sp.)-Oedema (Edema),"Physiological problem that is more prominent when air is cooler than soil, soil moisture is high, and relative humidity is high. Low transpiration rates with an increase in water absorption increase cell pressure, erupting epidermal cells and allowing inner cells to enlarge and protrude. This protrusion causes cells to die and discolor (yellow, brown, or rust), giving the impression that a parasitic organism is involved.
Any mechanical injury to epidermal cells has a similar effect. The most common causes of mechanically caused oedema in the Pacific Northwest are insect feeding injury (particularly aphids and thrips), injury from windblown soil particles, and damage from chemical applications.


","This disease may occur on any plant part but usually is on lower leaf surfaces. First symptoms are watery blisters or galls, many or just a few. The more succulent tissue appears to be more susceptible. Blisters or galls turn dark brown, yellow, or rust and give the appearance of a rust or bacterial infection.


","

1) Control insects, particularly aphids and thrips. See the     for details.

2) When cabbages are small, control windblown soil particles by sprinkler irrigation when winds are high.

3) Harvest storage cultivars before the onset of heavy fall rains, which waterlog the soil.

4) Cultivars differ in susceptibility, so it is good insurance to grow several suitable cultivars rather than just one or two.

5) Damaged heads often can be salvaged by stripping off outer leaves, which are most severely affected. This makes economic sense only if the market is particularly strong.

Cabbage and Cauliflower ,(Brassica sp.)-Ring Spot (Black Blight),"A fungus, Mycosphaerella brassicicola, attacks cabbage, cauliflower, Brussels sprouts, and broccoli. The disease is a problem mostly with seed production. Seeds may carry the pathogen. The fungus also overwinters on infected weed and crop hosts or in residues. Spores spread by wind. Cool (59°F to 70°F) moist weather favors disease development.


","All aboveground portions of the plant may show symptoms. Individual lesions have dark concentric rings, from black fruiting bodies, with definite edges surrounded by a yellowish zone. Under severe attack, spots coalesce, and the entire plant may be affected and blackened. In seed stalks, the fungus causes a distortion similar to the injury caused by the herbicide 2,4-D. Dark lesions may develop on stored cabbage and may penetrate deeply.


","

Cabbage and Cauliflower ,(Brassica sp.)-Sclerotinia Stem Rot and Watery Soft Rot,"Sclerotinia sclerotiorum is a fungus that overwinters as small black structures (sclerotia) attached to decomposing infected plant portions. Sclerotia may survive several years. After a moisture-conditioning period of at least 70 days, they produce a small, stalked, cup-shaped fruiting structure (apothecium), which releases spores into the air. Spores may infect senescent tissue such as blossoms and leaves or may germinate and colonize plant debris. After colonizing, the fungus can invade any part of the plant with which it comes in contact. Moist conditions within the plant canopy favor infection, as do rain, dew, and/or irrigation practices that keep foliage wet for long periods.
Other host plants include bean, carrots, pea, lettuce, potato, green pepper, cucurbits, parsnip, radish, other crucifers including canola, flower seed crops, and sunflower. Dandelion (Taraxacum officinale) is a very susceptible weed host.


","The disease is mainly on aboveground parts, producing a cottony white mold. As cabbage leaves decay, small dark bodies appear in the mold. Finally, the mold is replaced by numerous hardened sclerotia that gradually change from white to black.
On seed crops, stem attacks cause severe losses. Diseased tissues eventually bleach white, giving the disease its name ""white blight."" Sclerotia that are black on the surface and white inside, associated with this bleached tissue, are diagnostic.

Cabbage and Cauliflower ,(Brassica sp.)-White Leaf Spot and Gray Stem,"The fungus, Pseudocercosporella capsellae (sexual stage: Mycosphaerella capsellae), has been observed in various Brassica vegetable and seed crops in Oregon. It has been reported in oilseed rape in the United Kingdom and Canada with pod losses of 15% having been reported in Europe. Turnip, Chinese cabbage, mustards and oilseed rape are thought to be more susceptible than cabbage, cauliflower, broccoli and other vegetable Brassica species. Horseradish and radish are susceptible to white leaf spot as well as weedy types such as wild radish, wild mustard, and shepherd's purse.
Ascospores develop on infected Brassica or Raphanus residues during the autumn and possibly winter or spring months; these ascospores are wind-dispersed relatively long distances following rain or dew events. After a successful infection, asexual spores (conidia) subsequently develop in the leaf spots and are spread relatively short distances by rain or splashing water, causing secondary spread, including pod and seed infections. Seed transmission has not been reported to play a major role in disease outbreaks; infected crop residues are usually necessary for large-scale outbreaks, but seed transmission can lead to introduction of disease into new areas. Temperatures of 50°F to 60°F with moist conditions (rain, dew, or irrigation) promote disease development.


","This fungus can attack leaves, stems and pods. Tan, irregular or roundish spots develop on leave, especially leaf tips and edges, later becoming ashy-gray to white with a brownish margin and sometimes a yellowish halo. White conidia can be observed on the underside of leaf spots. Leaf spots will become dark brown as leaves senesce, due to the initiation of the sexual stage. The center of older lesions may fall out, resulting in a shot hole appearance. Lesions may coalesce when disease is severe, resulting in defoliation. Stem lesions are elongated and first brown, turning ashy-gray to white with a brownish margin and numerous tiny dark specks due to the formation of the sexual stage; there is a distinct boundary between diseased and healthy tissue on the stem. Gray stem lesions are superficial; the pith is not severely infected, helping to distinguish gray stem from black leg. Pod infections are at first small brown spots that expand and turn grayish-white with numerous tiny dark specks due to the formation of the sexual stage.


","

1) Rotate out of crucifers for 3 years.

2) Avoid planting in or adjacent to a field infected the previous season.

3) Control susceptible weeds and volunteer  and  plants.

4) Remove plant debris or bury by deep-plowing. Flailing followed by a shallow incorporation may be sufficient depending on amount and size of plant debris as well as environmental conditions.

The fungus-like organism Phytophthora taxon morella on California or Pacific Wax Myrtle (formerly Myrica californica). This disease has been found in the central Oregon coast from Florence to Lincoln City and was first noticed in a few plants in 2007. In 2009 it was found to be more severe and widespread; little is currently known about the disease but it is expected to be similar to other foliar blights due to this pathogen. The pathogen is favored by low temperature and is more active during the winter and early spring than at other times. It overwinters in infected leaves on the plant and on the ground. During these periods, sporangia produced in the leaves will release zoospores that are spread by driving rain and wind to new tissues where they initiate new infections. New leaves produced in late fall or winter are very susceptible. Leaves produced during the spring are less so, and new infections fall off as the weather warms. Plants that are in shady conditions, where the leaves remain moist for much of the day, are more severely affected than those in more open sites.

Infection sometimes resembles other Phytophthora infections (V-shaped areas of necrosis following the mid-rib), but not all leaves with these symptoms are due to Phytophthora. Leaves in the interior part of the plant, or those in shade will be more severely affected. Diseased leaves turn completely brown and dry with age or with hot weather, and infected landscape plants may be completely bare of lower leaves. Roots are not directly affected.


","

1) Prune off infected leaves and branches.

2) Remove and destroy fallen leaves from around the base of plants.

3) Do not over-fertilize, and do not apply fertilizer late in the season, which stimulates succulent new growth which is likely to be more susceptible to infection.

4) Avoid overhead irrigation or apply such that plants are not wet for extended periods of time.

Calla Lily ,(Zantedeschia spp.)-Soft Rot,"The bacteria Pectobacterium carotovorum enters plants though wounds. Wounds may be from physical injury to the rhizomes or from living organisms like insects or fungi. Soft rot may be secondary to many other diseases such as those caused by Pythium. The disease is favored by moist conditions. Frost can also cause a meltdown of the entire plant. The bacteria survive in old plant debris and infected rhizomes. Transplanting, irrigation water or cutting and digging tools can spread the bacteria. This disease is considered the most important factor limiting production.


","Plant parts become soft and slimy. Generally found at the base of leaves or anywhere on the rhizome. Leaves may appear water-soaked and are soft and slimy. Leaves start out turning dark green, may have spots then wilt, turn yellow and die. Typically, the foliage and flower stalks develop a brown, soft rot at the soil surface.

1) When receiving rhizomes, unpack immediately and let dry out under mild dry conditions to let abrasions heal.

2) Discard any diseased rhizomes immediately. Wash hands and equipment well before handling more plant material.

3) If soaking in Gibberellic acid for increased flowering, make sure soak times are short and rhizomes dry quickly and thoroughly. Dip tanks should use fresh water and be cleaned frequently.

4) Plant in well-drained soil or soilless media at a pH of 6.0 to 6.5.

5) Be sure to plant the rounded side down and the part where the roots and sprouts emerge at the top.

Camellia,Flower and Petal Blight,"Ciborinia camelliae (formerly Sclerotinia camelliae), a fungus that attacks only opened flower parts. Hard brown-to-black fungus bodies (sclerotia) develop in the base of old infected flowers. Sclerotia later produce one or more mushroom-like growths (apothecia), which, in turn, produce spores to cause new petal infections. Sclerotia can survive in soil at least 4 years and serve as a source of apothecia each year. Sclerotia are active during the normal flowering period of camellia. Spores are windblown and can travel up to 1 mile. The disease may spread from flower to flower by direct contact. The disease is common in areas west of the Cascade Range. Quarantined from shipment to Tennessee, and Texas.


","First, small brown spots on petals. Later, spots enlarge and eventually cover the whole petal. After a few days, the whole flower becomes brown. Spots can be distinguished easily from weather injury, which is usually indicated by lighter colored spots and is limited to the outer margin of camellia flowers. Spots caused by Botrytis are similar.

Camellia,Leaf Spots,"Aside from the physiological oedema problem, there have been a few fungal leaf spots reported from Oregon and Washington including Pestalotia sp. and Phyllosticta sp. Several other fungi can cause leaf spots on Camellia but are not common in the Pacific Northwest.


","Irregular brown spots.


","Remove and destroy old leaves, flowers, and other plant debris, especially under the camellias.

","Not generally needed but many of the fungicides labeled for flower and petal blight will also be effective on these leaf spots.


",
Camellia,Oedema,"Physiological. Oedema (edema) is more prominent when air temperatures are lower than soil temperatures, soil moisture is high, and relative humidity is high. Low transpiration rates with an increase in water absorption increase cell pressure, erupting epidermal cells and allowing the inner cells to enlarge and protrude. This protrusion kills the cells and discolors them (yellow, brown, or rust), giving the impression that a parasitic organism is involved. Light levels, low nutrition, and high soil moisture each contribute to oedema development in Pelargonium sp. Also affected are Brassica, Dracaena, Fatshedera, Peperomia, and Polyscias. Other plants that can be affected include begonia, eucalyptus, hibiscus, hosta, privet, schefflera, and yew.


","This condition is usually found on lower leaf surfaces. The first symptom is few or numerous watery blisters or galls. Blisters or galls can turn a dark brown-yellow or rust color and look like a rust or bacterial infection. The undersides of camellia leaves develop brown, corky, roughened swellings. On foliage plants, lesions may be concentrated near the leaf margin. They also can be lighter than surrounding areas of the leaf.


","

1) Reduce storage or growing humidity or soil moisture, if possible.

2) Maintain proper fertility for the plant being grown.

Camellia,Ramorum Leaf Blight and Shoot Dieback,,"Infected leaves develop dark, water-soaked lesions with defined margins. When lesion dry out they turn brown and brittle and may distort thinner leaves. Lesions on older leaves do not involve the entire leaf blade. Lesions may cover young leaves completely and then travel down the petiole and into the stem. Lesions may be difficult to see on the upper surface of some cultivars but more obvious on the lower surface. Diseased leaves generally fall off 4 to 5 days after infection even if there are no symptoms present. Defoliation is a common characteristic of this disease. Occasionally branch diebacks have been observed. Under extensive rainy conditions, flower buds may become necrotic starting first on sepals and progressing throughout the bud. Infected buds eventually abscise.

Camellia-Sooty Mold ,(Black Mold),"Saprophytic fungi that live on the excrement of cottony camellia scale and soft brown scale, common camellia insect pests. The fungus Atichia glomerulosa (sexual Seuratia millardetii) called false sooty mold has been found in Washington. This fungus lacks hyphae, is not parasitic and does not seem to be associated with scale insects. Sooty mold typically causes little damage to plants aside from an aesthetic problem. Very heavy fungal coverings on leaves may interfere with photosynthesis and cause some plant decline.


","Dark, brown-black, powdery fungus growth over leaf surfaces. Severe black fungal growth will almost completely cover the upper leaf surface. Black fungal growth may cover anything that the excrement falls on including other plants and even the walls or windows of an adjacent house.

The viral variegation produces irregular white spots or blotches on flowers. Leaves also may show white or yellow blotches; some leaves are almost entirely affected. Margins of affected areas are not distinct and blur into the normal color of the plant part. The pattern of affected plant tissue also is irregular on the whole plant; some branches show symptoms, others do not.

Potyvirus (BYMV and/or CaYSV) - In green-leaf cultivars, potyvirus infection produced mosaic and necrotic symptoms. Cultivars Burning Ember and Wyoming have red/green foliage where the red pigmentation was reduced in infected plants. Other symptoms reported include flecking, mosaic, leaf streaking and necrosis, which in severe cases render plants unsaleable.
Coinfection of canna with both CaYSV and CaYMV had symptoms that progressed from a mild mottling to a mosaic and necrosis along the veins and the leaf lamina.

Seed can also transmit Fusarium wilt, usually by contamination of the seed coat. Melon seeds may have an internal infection just under the seed coat.
There is specialization within this fungal species towards various plant hosts affected. These formae speciales of Fusarium oxysporum, which incite Fusarium wilt on cucurbits are as follows: f. sp. cucumerinum (cucumber), f. sp. melonis (muskmelon), and f. sp. niveum (watermelon). There are also races within the formae speciales; at least three watermelon races, four melon races, and three cucumber races have been reported.


","The fungus can attack a susceptible plant at any stage of growth. Infection of the hypocotyl of young plants can result in pre- or post-emergence damping-off. Infection of older plants can cause yellowing (starting in the older leaves), stunting, or wilting, and once wilting occurs, death may result in 3 to 5 days. Affected melon plants may develop a lesion on the lower stem. The fungus affects the vascular system and infected plants may not show noticeable symptoms until they begin bearing fruit. Browning of the vascular system is usually evident in the lower stem, crown, or tap root. After the plant dies, a white mycelium mat may form on external plant surfaces. Root rot is not observed.

Cantaloupe ,(Cucumis sp.)-Verticillium Wilt,"Verticillium dahliae, a soilborne fungus that infects a wide range of crops, vegetables, fruits, and ornamentals. It survives in soil for many years through the production of microsclerotia in infested plant tissue. It infects via roots, invading water-conducting tissue. Cool, moist soil favors the disease. Some cultivars have a greater degree of resistance. Young plants can be infected but symptoms won't develop until after fruit-set.


","Under stress from heat and/or fruit set, wilting and yellow, V-shaped areas develop at the leaf edge. Leaves turn completely yellow and dry up. Wilting may be one-sided and progresses up the plant until the plant dies. A cross-section of a node near the plant base may reveal discolored vascular tissue.

Carnation ,(Dianthus caryophyllus)-Bacterial Wilt,"Burkholderia caryophylli, a vascular, bacterial problem. Bacteria enter the plant through wounds. After infection it may take a month for symptoms to show although the bacteria have already colonized the roots and vascular system. Cuttings from symptomless plants can carry the bacterium. Hands, tools, and splashing water can spread this bacterium. Most carnations are susceptible but Dianthus capitatus ssp. andrzejowskianus and D. henteri were found to be resistant.
Most cultivars are highly susceptible but Wiko, Nocto and Sandrosa have adequate resistance.


","Plants wilt, turn dry, become colorless with roots disintegrating. The first symptom is a grayish-green foliage that rapidly turns yellow, wilts, and dies. Yellow streaks of frayed tissue in vascular areas extend 1 or 2 feet up the stem. When soil temperature is below 63°F, the internodes become deeply cracked. At high temperatures plants wilt. Infected cuttings wilt and die before forming roots. Cutting diseased stems reveals a brownish-yellow ooze. Diseased tissue is sticky in comparison to plants with Fusarium wilt.


","

1) Use culture-indexed plants free of the pathogen.

2) Use sterilized soil or use a soilless potting mix.

3) Remove diseased plants from production areas as soon as possible, including healthy-appearing plants in a 1.5-foot radius from the diseased plants.

4) Clean and wash hands and tools after handling plants.

5) Thoroughly clean and sterilize the greenhouse between production cycles.

6) Avoid overhead waterin, or any practice that keep plants wet for extended periods.

Carnation ,(Dianthus caryophyllus)-Fusarium Wilt,"Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. dianthi, a soilborne fungus that infects plant roots or wounded cuttings. It survives in the soil as thick-walled, dormant chlamydospores, and on wooden benches used for plant production in the greenhouse. Chlamydospores germinate in response to exudates from nearby plant roots. Hyphae then penetrate the roots (wounded or not), colonize the cortex, and move into the xylem tissue which becomes brown. Small spores (microconidia) are produced and carried up into the plant. Infection of the vascular system interferes with water and nutrient absorption. As the plant dies, the fungus erupts through the epidermis and forms tuft-like structures called sporodochia. Spores formed on these tufts can become airborne and infect nearby soils and plants. These macrospores and mycelium in the host tissue convert to chlamydospores and are released into the environment as the tissue decomposes.
The fungus can be spread by soil, wind, water, infected cuttings, and contaminated tools, equipment and clothing. Suppression of fungus gnats has been report to prevent spread. Warm temperatures and conditions favor the disease. Potting media with peat or coir fiber are conducive to disease development. Amendment of soil with compost or manure with high levels of organic nitrogen has reduces incidence of the disease.
This fungus has been reported from Washington and found by the OSU Plant Clinic. Eleven races of the fungus are known, falling into six vegetative compatibility groups, but it is likely more complex than that. Race 2 is reported as prevalent worldwide. The cultivars Arbel and Scarlette seem to have a stable resistance to race 2.


","Lower leaves yellow, wilt, and dry up one side of the plant. Symptoms progress up the plant. The stem often shrivels and turns grayish and the xylem tissues turn brown. Shoots may be stunted and grow abnormally. The top of the main shoot grows at a right angle to the main stem. Plants may curl when symptoms develop on one side of the plant. Late in the disease, roots, and stems rot and the plant dies.


","Clean growing surfaces, clean water and handling practices along with soilless media are all helpful. Integration of several tactics is needed to manage this disease.

1) Use culture-indexed plants free of the pathogen.

2) Use sterilized soil or use a soilless potting mix.

3) Remove diseased plants from production areas as soon as possible.

4) Thoroughly clean and sterilize the greenhouse between production cycles.

5) Do not over-fertilize and keep media pH near neutral.

6) Preplant soil solarization has been helpful in reducing populations of certain soilborne pathogens and weeds in western Oregon. Place clear plastic (preferably anti-condensation film) directly on smooth, rototilled ground, which has been irrigated to field capacity and then allowed to drain for 1-2 days. Bury the edges of the plastic to trap the heat. Solarize for 4-6 weeks (or longer) during the hottest part of the summer, beginning in early- to mid-July. A similar practice can be done in the greenhouse.

","Not effective as a sole treatment but must be integrated with cultural controls. Use these materials preventively only at seeding or transplanting. Do not use to salvage the crop, as treatments are generally ineffective and only help increase the risk of developing resistant fungi.

Carnation ,(Dianthus caryophyllus)-Gray Mold,"Botrytis cinerea, a fungus that survives as mycelium, conidia or sclerotia and colonizes dead, dying, and wounded plant parts. From these infections fungi can attack healthy tissues. A moist, humid environment is ideal for the pathogen's sporulation and spread. Conidia are transported by air currents, insects, or water splash to plant surfaces. Conidia may come from sources inside and outside the greenhouse. After germination, spores enter the host through wounds or natural openings. It is found everywhere plants are grown and has a wide host range. Flower petals are most susceptible at any stage of development. Latent infections can result in losses after cutting and during shipping. Infection of tissues produces ethylene which in turn induces susceptibility and enhances senescence of flowers.


","Brown water-soaked spots on leaves or petals, which later produce a gray-brown mass of spores. Petals may turn brown and also can be covered with the gray fungal growth. Infected buds may fail to open and sometimes abort.

Carrot ,(Daucus carota)-Aster Yellows,"Candidatus (Ca.) Phytoplasma asteris is spread by leafhoppers. Phytoplasmas survive the winter on weed hosts. Aster yellows also occurs in lettuce, endive, tomato, parsley, onion, squash, salsify, many weeds, and several ornamental flowering plants.


","New leaves in the plant's heart are yellow, reduced in size, deformed, and dense in growth. Older leaves may have a purple or reddish color. Carrot roots frequently are deformed and develop dense tufts of hair-like rootlets. Dormant buds in the crown may develop so the plant takes on a witches' broom appearance.

Carrot ,(Daucus carota)-Bacterial Leaf Blight,"Xanthomonas hortorum pv. carotae (formerly X. campestris pv. carota) is a bacterium. The disease can be damaging particularly to carrot seed crops. The pathogen can be transmitted in or on seed and can also survive in diseased plant debris. Xanthomonas is spread by wind-blown rain, splashing of irrigation water, or mechanically by insects. Warm, wet conditions favor disease development.


","Leaf symptoms start as small, irregular, yellow areas, which later turn to irregular, water-soaked, brown lesions. The lesion is surrounded by an irregular yellow halo, and the center becomes dry and brittle. Linear, dark brown lesions on petioles and stems may appear, sometimes with gummy bacterial exudate. Umbels may be partially or completely blighted. Seed yield and quality may be adversely affected.

Carrot ,(Daucus carota)-Black Rot,"The fungus, Alternaria radicina (syn. = Stemphylium radicinum), can be seedborne or may overwinter in crop refuse. A. radicina typically is responsible for most cases of black root rot under cool soil or storage conditions.


","In Oregon, black root rot typically occurs either in late winter or in early spring on overwintered carrots or carrots grown for seed production. The fungal pathogen attacks the leaf stalk base and crown and may infect in the fall to incite late-winter and spring lesions. In addition, black root rot may occur on carrots in storage, but the decay does not appear to spread from root to root in storage. Symptoms may be small to extensive black lesions on the root surface, with a well-defined border between infected and healthy tissues. Such lesions may not penetrate deeply. Lesions may enlarge slowly in colder temperatures, even those near freezing. If lesions are extensive, plants may be stunted and also are prone to secondary infections by other organisms.


","Together, these measures should keep the diseases under control.

1) Use pathogen-free seed.

2) Irrigate so that carrots are dry by nightfall.

3) Rotation out of carrots for at least 1 year is important because refuse is the main way the organisms overwinter.

4) Plow under crop debris soon after harvest.

5) For seed crops, obtain transplant carrots free of  infection.

","Good eradication of A. radicina from carrot seed has been achieved with hot water (122°F for 30 min).

In areas where wild carrots or cultivated carrots survive year-round, both the virus complex and the vectors can overwinter on them and transmit the disease to commercial carrot and parsley crops early in the next growing season. In colder areas, vectors overwinter on willow and have to acquire the viruses from an infected host plant before they can transmit. Both of these viruses can infect parsley and cilantro but since cilantro is not a host for the aphid vector, it is unlikely to act as a source for virus spread.

Carrot ,(Daucus carota)-Soft Rot (Core Soft Rot),"Erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora (syn. = Pectobacterium carotovorum subsp. carotovorum), a bacterium that survives in decaying refuse. It enters the root principally through cultivation wounds, harvest bruises, freezing injury, and insect openings. After infection, high humidity is essential for progress of the disease. When soft rot occurs in the field, it usually follows a period of waterlogging in low areas following excessive rain or irrigation. Carrots, parsnips, potatoes, onions, crucifers, and celery are only a few of the many plants attacked.


","A soft decay of the fleshy root tissue takes on a watery or slimy consistency as the rot progresses. Rotted tissues keep their natural color until they completely decay. In the field, tops of rotted carrots turn yellow and wilt as roots break down.


","

1) For the earliest and latest seedings of carrots, avoid fields subject to a high water table during wet conditions.

2) Harvest carefully, particularly during warm weather.

3) When soil temperatures are high, carrots harvested for immediate sale should be washed and cooled promptly and rinsed with clean, chlorinated water before being placed in a refrigerated holding area.

4) Harvest crops intended for long-term storage after soil and air temperatures drop. Keep storage as close as possible to 30°F to 32°F and 85% to 90% relative humidity.

Carrot ,(Daucus carota)-Violet Root Rot,"Rhizoctonia crocorum (teleomorph: Helicobasidium brebissonii), a soilborne fungus. In the Pacific Northwest, the disease has been a problem in some carrot fields. The fungus reportedly has a wide host range including asparagus, globe artichoke, alfalfa, bean, beet, cabbage, celery, clover, dandelion, fennel, mangel, parsley, potato, rape, rhubarb, sugar beet, sweet potato, and turnip as well as numerous weed species. It can survive as mycelium or sclerotia in soil or on susceptible crop and weed hosts. The fungus may be spread as a contaminant on seed, plant parts, soil, tools, floodwater, and equipment. The mycelium grows through the soil from plant to plant. Optimum temperature for infection is 59°F to 61°F. The disease is most destructive on heavy, unlimed soils.


","The disease attacks the plants' underground parts, causing stunting, yellowing, and wilting of aboveground parts or the plant's death. The fungus produces a loose mat of reddish purple mycelium over the underground plant portions. Embedded in the mat are numerous small dark sclerotia. A dry rot occurs, after which secondary organisms may cause a wet rot. A pink to brown characteristic mycelial mat may extend along the plant above the soil.

Cascara ,(Frangula purshiana)-Leaf Spots,"Several different fungi can cause leaf spots on cascara (sometime called buckthorn and formerly Rhamnus purshiana).
Marssonina rhamni, Coniothyrium rhamnigenum (formerly Phyllosticta rhamnigena), and Septoria blasdalei have been reported from Washington. The fungi overwinter in fallen leaves. They produce spores in spring in rainy weather, which also favors infection. More spores produced in the first lesions can produce new infections on healthy leaves.
Rust, caused by Puccinia coronata, also has been reported in the PNW. Alternate hosts for this rust are cultivated oats and several wild grasses such as velvetgrass, bluejoint, western bentgrass, and ryegrass.


","The spots caused by these fungi are similar in appearance and can be distinguished only by microscopic examination of the fruiting bodies and their spores. The spots are gray-to-brown and circular to irregular in shape. The fruiting bodies are produced on the upper surface of the leaf and can usually be seen as minute dots in the center of the spots.
Rust - Yellow to orange-yellow fruiting bodies are formed on the underside of leaves. The individual fruiting bodies are cup shaped and closely grouped together into what is called a cluster cup. The leaf tissue bearing the cluster cups becomes somewhat thickened and distorted and eventually dies.

Catalpa,Verticillium Wilt,"Verticillium dahliae, a fungus. Although there is no published report from the Pacific Northwest, OSU Plant Clinic has found the disease on Catalpa several times in Oregon. Trees planted near streets are reportedly very susceptible. The fungus survives for long periods in soil and is not easily controlled. The fungus grows into the xylem where it colonizes the plant through mycelial growth and conidial production. Conidia are transported passively by the fluid movement in the xylem. Once in the xylem, this fungus partially blocks water movement and produces toxins that result in wilt symptoms.


","Purplish to bluish brown streaks are found under bark in the sapwood of wilted branches. Wilting of leaves may occur on only one side of the tree. Trees may die back within a year or branch by branch over many years.

1) Fertilization may help if it is not applied too late in the year.

2) Remove and destroy symptomatic or dead branches preferably before leaves fall and thus before new inoculum gets incorporated into the ground.

3) Clean pruning equipment after use.

4) If tree dies and/or is removed, replace with a nonsusceptible host such as any conifer, birch, dogwood, sycamore, or willow.

Cedar ,(Cedrus spp.)-Cedar Flagging,"Evergreen plants, including conifers and broad-leaf types, naturally shed some old foliage each year. Stress factors, such as insufficient water, hot winds, construction damage or other root disturbance, poor planting procedures, or recent planting can promote flagging.


","Brown foliage develops on the tree or shrub in mid to late summer and is very obvious by early fall. Affected foliage is growth formed in previous years. Foliage developed during the current year (at branch tips) remains green. Brown branchlets are called flags and are generally spread uniformly throughout the canopy. Affected foliage may begin to drop during hot, dry weather. Most of the dead foliage is blown or washed out of the plant by wind and rain in fall and winter. The plant typically resumes its healthy appearance by spring.

Cedar ,(Cedrus spp.)-Needle Blight,"The fungi Sirococcus conigenus, S. tsugae and Kabatina sp. have been associated with blighted needles of Altas (Cedrus atlantica) and Deodar (Cedrus deodara) cedars in both Oregon and Washington; however, Sirococcus is found most often. More of a problem in years with prolonged wet, cool springs. Infection is on or adjacent to needle bases on new shoots. The disease cycle is completed in 1 year, although spore dispersal from dead parts may continue an additional 10 months. The fungus overwinters in dead shoots. Conidia are dispersed by splashing water during the spring and summer, with peak dispersal during the period of host shoot growth. Temperatures of 60°F to 70°F are most favorable for disease development. Symptoms appear about 2 weeks after infection, and lesion expansion on a given shoot may be completed after 4 to 6 weeks.


","Tan-pink needles are found in the spring. The blight may be only on the needles or extend through the new shoot into the previous year's growth. Terminal or lateral shoots may be blighted. Discolored tissue does not extend far into the branches. Shoot death and needle drop on established plants occur from June into August. Pycnidia develop on the bases of dead needles and along the stem of the dead shoots in late spring to early summer or the following spring. Similar symptoms have been seen without the association of any fungi.

Cedar ,(Cedrus spp.)-Root Rot (Armillaria),,,,,
Cedar ,(Chamaecyparis spp.)-Drought Injury,,,,,
"Cedar, Incense",Branch Canker,"A branch dieback of incenses-cedar has been observed in landscapes from Portland to Cottage Grove, OR areas. First observed in the 1990's but became more widespread in the 2010's. Phaeobotryon cupressi, a fungus, was shown to be able to cause these symptoms. In addition, a Diplodia sp. and a Seiridium sp., have also been found in association with branch cankers on limbs that have died back. Each fungus may be responsible for similar symptoms.This is thought to be a problem only on trees that have been weakened from growing on a poor site, drought, root damage, or other sources of chronic stress. Spores produced in cankers can spread via water splash to new tissues and initiate new infections. Sporulation has been observed during the growing season, but when spore-production begins and the length of time spores are present is unknown.
Although trees do not die from this disease they are of much lower aesthetic value. Owners typically prune off the dead limbs each year, until only a few feet of living branches near the top remain. Many affected trees are ultimately removed.


","Symptoms have been observed on older landscape trees that have been well established, as well as on nearby younger trees. Symptoms generally show up on the lower portion of trees as dieback of the smaller branches, Dead branches frequently appear intermixed with live ones on larger branches. Cankers are sunken and constricting, but are not resinous. There is a distinct line between necrotic tissue and healthy tissue at the canker margin, which is more obvious when the bark is removed. Trunk cankers have occasionally been observed. The disease progresses slowly up the tree resulting in significant branch loss over several years. Damage is sometimes more extensive on younger trees affecting a larger proportion of the crown and killing larger-diameter branches.


","

1) Prune out infected branches. Best to wait until dry weather in late summer so insects such as pitch moth are not attracted to pruning wounds. Destroy removed material.

2) Keep landscape trees well watered and stress-free. Also, do not overfertilize.

","It is unknown if any chemicals will aid in protecting trees from further spread of the disease.

"Cedar, Incense",Broom Rust,"Gymnosporangium libocedri, a fungus found frequently on incense-cedar (Calocedrus decurrens). Alternate hosts are apple, crabapple, hawthorn, mountain ash, pear, quince and serviceberry (Amelanchier). Infections on incense-cedars in early spring produce spores in jelly-like orange masses (telia) during wet weather. Telia may produce spores over several weeks in the spring. The spores do not re-infect incense-cedars, but are windblown to the deciduous host. Spores can be blown in the air for up to 6 to 10 miles. On the deciduous host, leaf spots will be produced later in the spring. Spores produced on this host are windblown to the incense-cedars, where they initiate infections. The jelly-like orange masses will be seen the following spring. Spores, from a single infection, may be produced over a 2- to 3-year period on cedars. This is not cedar apple rust, although the diseases are related.


","Infected branches can produce a witches' broom-a perennial structure in which the branch at the base of the broom is swollen with the growth of many short lateral shoots. Telia are cushion-like, reddish-brown, and not very noticeable until spring. During spring rains, telia form orange, jelly-like deposits on leaves and branches. Trees may appear to glow orange during the main flush of telia. These dry to a light-orange film but can become swollen again with subsequent rains. Trees with many infections decline and may eventually die.
Witches' brooms may not be present on landscape trees. Mature incense-cedar trees can often sustain many infections without significant adverse effect if they are otherwise healthy. Incense-cedars that are under chronic stress and those that are very young or recently planted may be adversely affected by heavy infections.

"Cedar, Port-Orford ",(Chamaecyparis lawsoniana)-Root Rot,"The fungus-like microorganisms Phytophthora lateralis and P. cinnamomi kill Port-Orford-cedar seedlings and trees. The disease was found in nursery stock in 1923 and has since spread throughout the Pacific Northwest, in the tree's native range, southwest Oregon, and in landscapes with extensive hedgerows. Spread into the southwest Oregon mountains has been slow but progressive. Dead trees can be found along streams and in drainage ditches on the down-slope sides of roads.
These fungus-like microorganisms survive as oospores or chlamydospores in plant debris such as rotted roots or foliage. Spores may be moved long distances in contaminated soil through human activities (for example, by logging equipment), by cattle, or through moving water. Spores germinate and produce sporangia and a swimming spore stage called zoospores, which attack fine roots and begin to rot the root system. Tree-to-tree spread can occur through root grafts. Spores splashed on leaves or stems can initiate a foliage blight. Infection also can occur through wounds.
Port-Orford-cedar is highly susceptible to P. lateralis while Alaskan cedar (C. nootkatensis) is seldom killed. C. taiwanensis has variable results. Other species of Chamaecyparis are considered resistant including C. obtusa, which can infrequently become infected. All are considered susceptible to P. cinnamomi, which has an extensive host range.


","The organism infects small roots first, then larger and larger roots until the tree is girdled near the collar. The fine roots are at first water soaked, then darken and quickly disintegrate. Infected inner bark turns cinnamon-brown in contrast to the normal cream color of healthy tissue. There generally is a sharp line between infected and healthy tissues. Infected trees' foliage is a slightly lighter color and may wilt on warm days. All foliage soon turns chlorotic, then bronze, and finally brown. Seedlings may die a few weeks after infection; large trees may take 2 to 4 years to die. In hedgerow landscape plantings, trees typically die one by one over several years as the organism moves between adjacent trees. Dead and dying trees may be attacked by bark beetles and are more likely to be blown down by strong winds.
Foliar symptoms are rare. Infections that begin on leaves or stems start locally but can spread down the stem or to other branches. Stem lesions are sunken and kill all foliage distal to the canker.


","

1) Plant healthy seedlings in soil known to be free of the organism.

2) Do not plant in soil with poor drainage or in areas that receive drainage from roads.

3) Prevent wounding at the base of trees or to roots from nearby construction or harvesting operations.

4) Avoid extensive gardening (mulching and planting susceptible flowering plants) under cedar hedges because it may introduce the disease and/or wound tree roots.

5) Promptly remove and destroy dead and dying trees to help protect other trees in the area. In landscape hedges, also remove healthy-looking trees next to diseased ones. Cedar bark beetle activity in trees has been associated with trees with root rot and may be good indicators of which healthy appearing trees need to be removed. Avoid moving infested soil while removing trees and/or stumps.

6) Plant resistant species in contaminated ground. If   is the only problem (which is very likely) then  ,  ,  ,  , and   may be planted. If   is the problem (which is possible), there are few options for planting besides a few crabapple and rhododendron species. Correct any drainage problems before replanting.

7) Resistant   are now available including susceptible scions grafted onto resistant rootstocks.

8) In sensitive forested areas of southwest Oregon, unpaved roads are closed during the rainy season. Also, consider removal of cedars along the road side to prevent infections in those areas.

"Cedar, Western Red ",(Thuja plicata)-Leaf Blight (Keithia Blight),"Didymascella thujina, a fungus. Although the disease is found mostly in warm-moist environments typical of coastal low elevations of the Pacific Northwest, the pathogen is endemic to North America and found throughout the natural range of western red cedar. Spore discharge begins in late spring and increases gradually during the summer, reaching a peak between late August and early November. Spores' stickiness helps them adhere to foliage. Spores produced in the summer can germinate in a few days, but many produced in fall remain dormant until the next spring. Conditions that keep foliage wet, aid disease development and spread. Symptoms develop the season after spore dispersal. Trees and shrubs of all age classes are attacked whether in nurseries, landscapes or forests. However, seedlings are most severely affected. The disease is found primarily on western red cedar (Thuja plicata), especially the cultivars Atrovirens and Excelsa.
Can also be confused with the minor problem caused by Pseudocercospora thujina (formerly Coryneum thujinum).


","Small, bleached spots on the upper surface of one-year-old leaves appear first. One or several brown to black fruiting structures (apothecia) appear on the small leaves in late spring.

Sudden flooding after a long dry period frequently induces black heart. The disease does not appear in crops grown at a continuously low or uniform moisture level. Soil aeration is important, particularly when soil moisture rapidly increases to saturation. Crops growing under excessive nitrogen levels are more susceptible to blackheart following a sudden increase in soil moisture, as the rate of growth exceeds the rate of calcium uptake from the soil.


","Many symptoms appear in young leaflets still within the plants' crowns. Tissue turns black, and necrosis advances rapidly until it involves the entire heart. Soft rot bacteria often follow, resulting in a slimy decay. First evidence may be chlorosis of the early-matured leaves followed by the blackened heart.


","

1) Maintain uniform soil moisture and moderate levels of available nitrogen.

2) When conditions favor blackheart, immediately apply a spray of calcium nitrate or calcium chloride at 5 to 10 lb/100 gal in a volume of 100 to 150 gal/A. Use sufficient spray pressure to penetrate outer leaves and reach the heart. Do not wait until symptoms appear; that may be too late to correct the problem.

Celery ,(Apium graveolens var. dulce)-Cottony Rot/Pink Rot (Sclerotinia),"Sclerotinia sclerotiorum is a fungus that overwinters as small black structures (sclerotia) in plant debris or in soil. Sclerotia may survive up to 8 years. After a conditioning period of several weeks at 40°F in moist soil, sclerotia can germinate in moist soil when temperatures are 59°F to 65°F and produce a small, stalked, cup-shaped fruiting structure (apothecium; plural: apothecia), which releases millions of spores into the air. Sporulating apothecia can persist 5 to 10 days. Spores are forcibly ejected and a few may be blown up to a mile but most land nearby. Spores can survive two weeks. Spores can infect senescent tissue such as dying leaves or plant debris and then invade any healthy part of the plant it physically contacts. Moist conditions within the plant canopy favor infection. Rain, dew, and/or irrigation practices that keep foliage wet for long periods favor white mold development.
There are many other host plants, including bean, pea, lettuce, carrots, cabbage, parsnip, potato, sunflower, radish, other crucifers, and cucurbits. Dandelion (Taraxacum officinale) is a very susceptible weed host. Only grasses, cereals, and onion are not affected by white mold.


","The disease is mainly on aboveground parts, producing a cottony white mold. As leaves decay, small white bodies appear in the mold and gradually change from white to black as hardened sclerotia develop. The disease frequently occurs in storage. This organism can cause damping-off of seedlings. In mature plants, the disease appears as a basal rot of crown and petiole. Decay is watery and fairly rapid. It turns pink and later is covered with white mycelium. In later stages, the white mycelium is covered with hard, black sclerotia. Frequently found after black heart.


","

1) Reduce humidity and high-moisture periods within the plant canopy and field.

1.1) Provide adequate aeration within, and especially between, rows by increasing plant and row spacing or trimming celery foliage. 
1.2) Orientating the rows in the direction of prevailing winds is useful for white mold control if the placement of irrigation equipment allows row orientation.
1.3) Time irrigations to allow drying of plant canopy before nightfall or use subsurface drip irrigation; keep the top 2 to 3 inches of bed dry.
1.4) Apply sufficient nitrogen to meet crop demands, but avoid excessive fertilization that can lead to dense, lush plant growth.
2) To reduce pathogen population within a field:

2.1) Rotate with non-hosts (grasses, cereals, and onion) for 8 years to achieve best control, but for at least 2 years to reduce population of sclerotia.
2.2) Deep plowing buries sclerotia but plowing later years may return viable sclerotia to the surface.
2.3) Where feasible, field flooding during warm temperatures destroys sclerotia. 
3) Cull and clean celery before placing into sanitized containers for storage. Store at 32°F and prevent condensation.

","No fungicide listed is likely to control pink rot enough to justify the expense of application for this disease alone.

Celery ,(Apium graveolens var. dulce)-Fusarium Yellows,"Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. apii, race 2. This is a soilborne fungus that has been spreading throughout the celery-growing areas of North America since it was first seen in California in 1975. Before that, Fusarium yellows affected only yellow, self-blanching varieties of celery.


","Affected crops show uneven growth with patches of stunted, yellowed plants. Infected plants have brown roots, discolored crowns, and yellow, curled leaves.


","

1) Avoid introducing this disease by preventing movement of soil, water, or plants from infested areas. Never dispose of celery trimmings on land that may grow celery because all parts of infected plants may contain fungal propagules.

2) Never grow transplants in soil that may be infested unless soil is first fumigated or steamed to destroy the soilborne inoculum.

3) Once introduced, buildup of inoculum can be slowed by rotating with unrelated crops such as corn, cole crops, cucurbits, or onions.

4) The cultivars Picador, Matador, and Starlet are resistant. Cultivars T.U. 52-70 HK, Tendercrisp, Vicar, Deacon, and Bishop are moderately resistant.

Celery ,(Apium graveolens var. dulce)-Late Blight (Septoria Leaf Blight),"Septoria apiicola (syn. = S. apiis, = S. apii-graveolentis),  a fungus. The disease overwinters on dead celery plant parts. The fungus is introduced in plantings primarily through infected seed. Fungus in the seed dies within 2 years; thus, seed should be pathogen-free after that. The name ""late blight"" is deceptive because infections frequently occur early in the season, a common problem in western Washington and British Columbia. The disease can be spread by water, equipment, and workers; if a field is infected with Septoria, do not work in it until the foliage is dry.


","Small, light yellow spots develop on leaves and petioles, gradually turning brown. Spots vary in shape and may coalesce if numerous. Minute, thickened, black dots (pycnidia) appear, containing spores of the fungus. Seriously infected leaves die. Symptoms on petioles are similar to those on leaves.


","

1) Treat 1- to 2-year-old seed in water at 118°F for 30 min, or use older seed as for early blight.

Cherry ,(Prunus spp.)-Armillaria Crown and Root Rot,"Armillaria mellea, a fungus, infects tree roots, killing the cambium and decaying the underlying xylem. Often found on newly cleared land, this root pathogen is native to the Pacific Northwest where it occurs on the roots of many woody perennials including native trees and agricultural hosts.
This fungus may form mushrooms at the base of infected trees in fall and winter. Mushrooms produce wind-blown spores, but these spores are not a significant means of infecting healthy trees. The fungus spreads vegetatively, below ground, which leads to the formation of groups of dead and dying plants called ""disease centers."" The fungus can survive on woody host roots long after the host dies. Its vegetative fungal tissue (mycelium) decomposes root wood for nutrients as it grows. When infected plants are removed, infected roots that remain below ground serve as a source of inoculum for trees planted in the same location.
Infection occurs when cherry roots come in direct contact with partially decayed tree roots and are colonized by mycelium. Infection can also occur when tree roots contact rhizomorphs (black, shoestring-like fungal structures) that grow out from partially decayed roots and through the soil. Once tree roots are infected, whether they are living or dead, they serve as a source of inoculum for neighboring trees.


","Trees may show poor terminal growth and undersized leaves. Trees will appear healthy but then suddenly collapse during summer. Dead leaves often will remain attached to dead branches. Diagnostic mycelial fans can be observed beneath the bark of the root crown of infected plants. Dig down about a foot below the soil line and use a pocketknife to remove thin layers of bark from the root collar. Mycelial fans are thick, white layers of fungus that adhere to the root bark and/or the wood beneath the bark. Signs will be located below the bark at the vascular cambium and not on the outside of the bark. Armillaria also makes black, shoestring-like structures called rhizomorphs, which are occasionally found within the bark and/or extending into surrounding soil. Rhizomorphs may look like roots on the outside but have an entirely different structure when cut open in cross-section.


","

1) When clearing a new site of forest trees and shrubs or when clearing a site with infected plants (infection centers) there are several precautions to take.

1.1) Girdle large trees before removal to hasten decay of roots.
1.2) After removing aboveground vegetation, clear soil of stumps and large roots. Deep-rip the soil in more than one direction to bring large roots to the soil surface. If possible, remove all roots greater than 1 inch in diameter from the soil.
1.3) Burn all woody debris.
1.4) Leave this ground fallow at least 1 year.
2) Trenches lined with plastic sheeting may help if inoculum is from an adjacent stand.

3) If using drip irrigation, move drip-line emitters away from the trunk and in between trees after first year of planting.

4) Permanently removing soil in a 3-ft radius around the crown and main trunk root area has been effective in citrus and other tree fruits grown in California and Australia and may be of benefit for managing infected trees in the Pacific Northwest. Also excavate root collars of healthy-looking trees surrounding disease centers. Be sure to keep root collars free of soil, especially in orchards with high gopher populations. Another twist of this idea was used to protect peach trees at planting in the Southeast United States by planting on raised hills or ""Smart pots."" The soil is removed once the trees have been established, which exposes the root crown.

5) Remove and destroy severely infected trees, being careful to remove as much root material as possible from soil. If practical, do not replant where infected trees have been removed.

Cherry ,(Prunus spp.)-Bacterial Canker,"Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae, a bacterium. This disease can be the limiting factor against establishing a cherry orchard anywhere in the Pacific Northwest. Two common genetic traits increase the bacteria's ability to cause disease. Most produce a powerful plant toxin, syringomycin, which destroys plant tissues as bacteria multiply in a wound. Bacteria also produce a protein that acts as an ice nucleus, increasing frost wounds that bacteria easily colonize and expand. Factors that weaken or injure the tree predispose it to developing cankers. These factors include wounds, frost damage, early dormant season pruning, heading cuts, incorrect soil pH, and poor nutrition. Important avenues of infection leading to tree death include natural leaf scars in the fall and heading cuts made in the spring after planting a new orchard. Infection by other pathogens including Cytospora, Verticillium, and Nectria can lead to more bacterial canker. Ring nematodes have also been associated with increased susceptibility to bacteria canker in both cherry and peach. Sources of bacteria include old cankers, healthy buds, systemic infections within trees (with or without cankers), as epiphytes on leaf surfaces, weeds, grasses, and even soil. Wind, rain, insects, infected bud wood, and infected nursery stock can spread bacteria. Pruning through cankered and then through susceptible, healthy tissue does not spread the disease.
Although bacterial canker is more serious on sweet cherry trees, it also affects almonds, apricots, peaches, plums, and prunes. The same bacterium also can cause a blight of many other fruit, vegetable, and ornamental crops.
The cherry cultivars Royal Ann, Bing, Lambert, Napoleon, Sweetheart, and Van are very susceptible to bacterial canker. The cherry cultivars Corum, Regina, Rainier, Sam, and Sue appear to have sufficient tolerance to canker to be grown commercially without serious tree loss. Mazzard seedlings, particularly the F12-1, can be used as resistant rootstocks. Size controlling rootstocks may also have useful resistance but field performance trials are lacking. Scions on Gisela 6 rootstock have exhibited increased susceptibility. The cherry cultivars Royal Ann, Bing, Lambert, and Van are quite susceptible to dead bud. 'Black Republican' and 'Mazzard' seedlings are somewhat less susceptible.


","The most conspicuous symptoms are cankers, gum exudation, and dieback of girdled branches. Dead buds and leaf spots also can occur. In most cases, heavy gumming is associated with bacterial canker formation on branches and twigs. Gumming occurs at the cankers' margins. Other problems can lead to gumming (see Cherry-Gumming).
Cankers caused by the bacteria may be on the trunk, limbs, and twigs. Typical cankers are much longer than broad, but a canker may girdle the infected limb or trunk. The cambium at the canker will be discolored and necrotic. Use a pocket knife to reveal this discolored tissue. Cankers develop in winter and early spring. As the tree begins growth in spring, the bacteria population declines and a callus layer forms around the canker's edge. During spring and summer, girdled and nearly girdled limbs may leaf out. Normally, leaves turn yellow, then the limbs usually die. In some instances, these symptoms may not appear until late summer when the leaves' water requirement is high.
Dead bud ""disease"" is first noted as dying buds on spurs in spring. Infected buds usually start to die in February. As the disease progresses, both leaf and flower become infected. Dead bud usually starts in lower limbs and moves up the tree and to adjacent trees in successive years. Often, trees in the lower orchard, where air drainage is poor, are the first to be infected. If all buds on a spur are killed, the spur will die back next season. Cankers very seldom form, but the diseased buds may produce a slight gumming. Repeated death of buds may result in misshaped growth and sometimes fasciation. In severe cases, 90% or more of buds on a tree may be killed.
Leaf and fruit spots are not common and are not numerous if they develop. Spots on leaves are at first water soaked, then become dry and brown. Spots on fruit are dark to black and depressed or pitted.


","Bacterial canker is best managed through the use of many different tactics.

1) Plant resistant cultivars and/or rootstocks. For example, F12-1 Mazzard rootstock with scions from virus-tested (and found to be free of all known viruses), canker-free trees has been very useful. Make buds or grafts at least 12 to 15 inches away from the trunk. Mazzard seedling rootstocks have also been useful.

2) Do not interplant new trees with old trees, which are a major source of the bacteria.

3) Locate orchard in an area less likely to be affected by frost. If planting in the spring, plant orchards after date that frost is likely to have occurred. Prevent winter injury by painting trunks white and avoiding late season fertility.

4) Test soil for ring nematodes before planting. Also test for pH and other physical characteristics that can be corrected prior to planting.

5) Provide optimal soil conditions for growing cherries including attention to pH and nutrition. Annually monitor for adequate nutrient levels such as nitrogen. Keep irrigation off above ground parts for the first few years.

6) Control weeds.

7) Delay dormant pruning until January or February. Summer pruning is even better and should be after harvest, when weather is dry. Make heading cuts after planting only during dry weather when rain will not occur for at least a week after pruning. Make heading cuts close to a lateral bud.

8) Completely remove infected trees or branches girdled and killed by cankers. Do not allow trees to regrow from roots or trunks left after a major trunk canker has been removed.

9) In summer, small cankers may be cut out using the following method. Cut away bark above and around the edges of the infected area. Use sharp tools, and leave wound margins smooth and neat. Wounds should be left uncovered to dry out during the summer. Try not to have sprinkler irrigation soak the wounds. Sterilize all pruning tools between cuts with an appropriate disinfestant.

10) Cauterizing cankers using a hand-held propane burner has been used with some success in New Zealand.

11) Scoring tree trunks has been practiced by Willamette Valley, Oregon growers for several years. Grower testimonials point to some benefits but there has been no research on the efficacy of the practice. A sharp pocket knife is used to make a vertical shallow cut in the tree trunk. The resulting wound tissue that develops is supposed to resist canker development and prevent trunk girdling. Knives should be disinfected between trees.

Cherry ,(Prunus spp.)-Black Canker,"An uncharacterized graft-transmissible pathogen, probably a virus spread in nursery propagation. In 1959, the disease was described as fairly common in older 'Royal Ann' plantings throughout Oregon. The most severely affected cultivar is Royal Ann, but the disease has also been observed in Bing, Republican, and Deacon.


","Cankers develop on 1-year-old twigs, having slightly swollen areas with the bark split lengthwise. These grow into rough black cankers, the ultimate size of which is more or less determined by the size of the affected branch. Some infected trees are severely cankered in many parts of the tree. No fruit or leaf symptoms have been observed.


","Plant virus-indexed (and found to be free of all known viruses) trees.

",,
Cherry ,(Prunus spp.)-Black Knot,"Apiosporina morbosa (formerly Dibotryon morbosum), a fungus. The disease is seen occasionally on wild and cultivated native Prunus spp. (plum, chokecherry, etc.) in eastern and southern Oregon and northeastern Washington. It has also been observed on understory trees in the Mt. Pisgah arboretum near Eugene, OR, riparian areas around Corvallis, OR and diagnosed on a home sample in Dallas, OR in 1982. It is rare in landscapes. It is an economically important disease of plums, prunes and sour cherry in the Eastern United States. Ascospores infect new shoots from budbreak through shoot elongation. Spores are produced from within 2-year-old knot tissue, primarily during rains at or shortly after bloom. Knots will not appear for several months after initial infection.


","Elongate, corky outgrowths or ""knots"" occur on shoots, spurs and branches of Prunus spp. Knots tend to be longer than they are wide. Newly formed knots have greenish, soft tissue while older knots are black and may be colonized by other fungi or insects. Knots can continue to expand 1 inch or more each year. Limbs are stunted and killed when girdled by the fungal growth. Older knots and growths take on a witches' broom appearance. Known by various names such as ""crap on a stick"" due to its resemblance to dog poop.


","Remove and destroy knots when observed on economically important crops. Scout adjacent orchards and wooded areas each winter for infected Prunus spp., which can act as a reservoir of spores. Remove branches 2 to 3 inches below knots and burn or bury infected debris.

","Not warranted for crops grown in the Pacific Northwest.


",
Cherry ,(Prunus spp.)-Brown Rot Blossom Blight and Fruit Rot,"The fungi Monilinia fructicola and M. laxa can incite a blossom blight, a twig and branch dieback, and a fruit rot of several Prunus spp. including many ornamental and fruit trees. Fungi survive year to year on infected twigs, branches, old flower parts, or mummified fruit. Conidia are produced on infected plant debris in the tree when the temperature is above 40°F. A small, mushroom-like structure (apothecium) can be produced on fruit that drops to the ground. Wind and rain blow spores (conidia and ascospores) to healthy blossoms in spring to begin the infection process during wet weather. Infection does not occur below 50°F and will occur for M. laxa above 55°F. Flowers can be blighted any time floral tissue is exposed but are most susceptible at full bloom. More spores can be produced on this tissue, initiating several more disease cycles during the spring. Under severe conditions, non-flowering shoots or leaves can be infected directly.
Some infections may be symptomless until fruit begins to ripen. The risk of these latent infections is highest from bloom through pit hardening, declines to a low risk at embryo growth then begins to increase as fruit ripen. Ripening fruit are highly susceptible to infection, and more disease cycles can occur near harvest. Peach, nectarine, and prune fruit that fall to the ground due to lack of pollination, thinning, or overripeness can significantly increase inoculum and the amount of fruit rot at harvest. Fruit infected in the orchard may not show symptoms until it is in storage or transit. High nitrogen fertilization also is associated with increased levels of brown rot.
Both fruiting and ornamental cherries, peaches, nectarines, prunes, plums, almonds, and apricots are susceptible. Pome fruit, including quince, can be susceptible under high disease pressure years. The disease is more of a problem west of the Cascade Range. Surveys of eastern Washington packinghouses during 2000 and 2001 found very little brown rot on peaches and nectarines.


","Infected flower parts turn light brown and may develop areas of buff-color (M. fructicola) or gray (M. laxa) spores. Infected petals may look water soaked, which can be mistaken for frost injury. Flowers generally collapse as the fungus invades through the pedicel. Infected flowers often adhere to twigs and spurs through harvest or even winter.
Depending on the fungus and plant infected, the disease may continue into twigs or spurs. Lesions may remain discrete or girdle the twig, causing all distal portions to die. Profuse gumming also may occur in these areas. Again, buff or gray spores (in sporodochia) may develop on these necrotic twigs.
Fruit symptoms begin as small, dark spots that enlarge rapidly. Fruit remains fairly firm and dry relative to a watery rot caused by Rhizopus sp. Production of masses of buff-color spores is equally rapid in the necrotic area. Peaches may have concentric rings of gray sporulation as the rot takes a few days to encompass the entire fruit. These fungi often colonize rain-cracked cherries. Occasionally, green fruit pitting has been attributed to this fungus as it can be detected in small necrotic area at the bottom of the depression in the skin.


","These must be supplemented by chemical control methods especially in the wettest areas such as west of the Cascade Range.

1) Remove and destroy infected twigs and branches in summer.

2) Remove and destroy all mummified fruit in and around the tree. Cultivating or burying old fruit before the growing season will not reduce the risk of this disease. However, removing fallen fruit (due to thinning or lack of pollination) can significantly reduce the amount of rot at harvest.

3) Control insects that could wound and injure fruit.

4) Avoid wounding fruit during harvest.

5) Cool fruit rapidly after harvest.

6) Use moderate amounts of nitrogen fertilizer.

7) A short (2.5 min) soak in hot water (122°F) has reduced postharvest decay in nectarines and peaches. Some additives have increased efficacy of this treatment. Microwaves used to increase fruit temperature for a short period have also been successful.

","Apply fungicides during the bloom period at early popcorn (red bud, pink bud, or green tip, depending on crop), full bloom, and/or petal fall to control the blossom blight phase. In California and Oregon, one or two sprays are sufficient most years if a product with systemic (translaminar) activity is used. Fruit-rot sprays can be applied before harvest if wet weather is expected. To reduce the possibility of resistant fungal strains, alternate or tank-mix fungicides from different groups that have different modes of action.

Cherry ,(Prunus spp.)-Cherry Mottle Leaf,"The Cherry mottle leaf virus is transmitted by budding, grafting, and has been experimentally transmitted by a microscopic eriophyid mite, Eriophyes inaequalis. The native bitter cherry, Prunus emarginata, is considered the mite's principal host and is a symptomless natural host of cherry mottle leaf. The disease occurs in a few orchards in all cherry-growing areas of Oregon and Washington, some of which have become infected through planting noncertified, symptomless cultivars. 'Rainer' is a carrier but does not show symptoms while 'Bing', 'Celeste', 'Corum', 'Lapins', and 'Sweetheart' can all show severe symptoms. Flowering cherry, peach and apricot are also hosts.


","A mottle-leaf pattern is the principal symptom, being most severe on 'Bing', 'Royal Ann', and 'Lambert'. Mottling is irregular and chlorotic, causing a leaf distortion early in the season; leaves pucker increasingly as the season advances. Leaves are smaller and may develop shotholes but do not fall. When severe, as in the case of 'Bing', fruits are abnormally small, lack flavor, and ripen later than normal. Tree growth is retarded, and shoots develop a rosette appearance. Less susceptible cultivars have the same general symptoms but are less severe.


","

1) Plant virus-indexed (and found to be free of all known viruses) trees.

2) Remove trees showing severe symptoms. They will never be profitable.

3) Remove wild cherry trees from around the orchard.

",,
Cherry ,(Prunus spp.)-Cherry Twisted Leaf,"Cherry twisted leaf-associated virus. has been reported from Washington, Idaho, and British Columbia and found in the Willamette Valley and The Dalles, Oregon. The disease is not common and occurs irregularly in the Pacific Northwest. It is easily transmitted by budding, grafting, or chip budding. The disease spreads in the orchard but there are no known vectors. 'Bing' and 'Rainer' are susceptible as is western chokecherry. Apricot Ring Pox disease is caused by the same virus.


","The most consistent symptom is an abrupt kink in the midrib or the petiole, which causes the leaf to appear twisted. Leaves frequently develop asymmetrically or stay small. Spurs appear bunchy due to shortened internodes. Once the tree is infected, the disease spreads rapidly to all branches. Symptoms occur each year on infected trees, but their severity is variable: generally, more severe in older trees of medium vigor.


","

1) Remove infected trees.

2) Remove wild cherry trees from around the orchard.

3) Plant trees certified as virus-tested (and found to be free of all known viruses).

",,
Cherry ,(Prunus spp.)-Crinkle Leaf and Deep Suture,"Believed to be of genetic origin. These disorders are bud propagated but not graft transmissible. Crinkle leaf, commonly found in the cultivars Bing and Black Tartarian, will reduce yields. Severely affected fruit with either disease is not marketable.


","Both diseases result in misshapen leaves. Those of crinkle-affected trees are mottled, whereas leaves of deep suture affected limbs have a textured surface. Often, leaf margins are indented and serrated and blossoms are smaller and defective. In crinkle disease, the fruits are small, pointed, and often have a raised suture whereas the suture is severely indented in deep suture. These diseases may be only on a small branch or on almost all branches of a tree.


","Cut out affected branches where they join the trunk; cut out affected branches and rework with unaffected scion wood; or remove trees.

",,
Cherry ,(Prunus spp.)-Crown Gall,"Rhizobium radiobacter (formerly Agrobacterium tumefaciens), a bacterium that lives for several years in soil, often spreading from diseased nursery stock. It also may be moved by irrigation water or cultivation equipment. Although the bacterium has a wide host range, plants more likely to have crown gall include all stone and pome fruit, caneberries (such as blackberry and raspberry), euonymus, Photinia, poplar, rose, walnut, and willow. Colt cherry rootstock is reportedly quite susceptible while Gisela 5 and 6 may have useful resistance in contaminated soil.
The bacterium enters plants through wounds, either natural or caused by pruning, grafting, mechanical injury from cultivation, heaving of frozen soils, chewing insects, or the emergence of lateral roots. After the bacterium enters a wound, a small piece of its DNA is transferred into the plant's DNA. The foreign DNA transforms normal plant cells in the wounded area into tumor cells. Once transformed, tumor cells proliferate automatically. The result is a gall, a disorganized mass of hyperplastic and hypertrophic tissue.


","On young nursery trees, soft, spongy, or wart-like galls develop on the crown or on roots. Gall size on mature trees ranges from a fraction of an inch to several inches across. Galls on woody plants become hard with a rough, fissured surface as they age. Gall tissues are irregular and have no definite growth pattern. If galls completely encircle the trunk of a young tree, it may be girdled and die. Symptoms may not develop for over a year if infection occurs when temperatures are below 59°F.


","

1) Use only pathogen-free nursery stock. Inspect new trees, and do not plant any with gall symptoms.

2) Do not plant nursery trees in soil with a recent history of crown gall.

3) Preplant soil solarization has been effective for nursery stock in western Oregon. Place clear plastic (preferably anti-condensation film) directly on smooth, rototilled ground, which has been irrigated to field capacity and then allowed to drain for 1-2 days. Bury the edges of the plastic to trap the heat. Solarize for 4-6 weeks (or longer) during the hottest part of the summer, beginning in early- to mid-July.

4) Use care in planting trees, avoiding injury to bark around the crown because bacteria in the soil can enter such injuries.

5) Destroy seriously declining trees in the orchard if large galls surround the crowns.

6) Select well-drained soils for planting.

7) Plant when soil temperature is below 50°F.

","


1) Gallex (ready to use) painted on very young galls to reduce further development. Galls may return the following year or, if treated late, may continue to develop.

Cherry ,(Prunus spp.)-Cytospora Canker,,,,,
Cherry ,(Prunus spp.)-Dead Bud,,,,,
Cherry ,(Prunus spp.)-Gumming,"Mechanical injury, winter injury, chemical injury, insect damage, fungal diseases, or improper growing conditions. Gumming often follows brown rot, or shothole (peach, apricot), twig infections. Botryospheria spp and wood decay fungi can also result in gummosis (among other symptoms) and yield reductions of 12% to 22%. The disease bacterial canker, caused by Pseudomonas syringae, also can produce a severe gumming of sweet cherry and some other stone fruit trees. However, gumming also may be spontaneous, especially in trees that have made a forced growth due to too much water or nitrogen fertilizer, or both. Sweet cherry trees in wet or other unfavorable locations are particularly liable to gummosis. Sweet cherry trees treated with ethephon to loosen fruit or stimulate flowering can develop a clear gummosis.


","Gum exuding from buds, twigs, branches, or trunks. Pools or large deposits of gum collect beneath the bark at the crotch, on larger branches, or on the trunk. Gum eventually breaks through to the surface and runs down the bark.


","

1) Control insects and fungus diseases.

2) In large cankers, cut away all dead tissue until a sound surface is exposed. Treat the wound with a reliable disinfectant.

3) Follow cultural practices that produce a firm, stocky, moderate growth rather than a forced growth of soft wood.

4) Prevent trunk injury when possible. Whitewashing or shielding trunks from the sun can prevent winter injury.

Cherry ,(Prunus spp.)-June Drop,"The normal abscission of fruits that occurs before pit hardening. Also called ""Cherry Run Off"" in Europe. A certain percentage of fruit will drop due to lack of fertilization. Some cultivars, such as Sweetheart, shed more than other cultivars and some years are worse than others. There are 3 stages of drop. The first occurs about 2 to 2.5 weeks after full bloom, the second about a week later, and the third drop of a relatively few fruit about 3 weeks after the second drop. The exact mechanism is unknown but various explanations include lack of pollination, lack of fertilization, incompatibility, nutrient imbalance, winter injury, frost damage around bloom, and/or high temperatures during bloom.


","Green fruit that appear to be developing normally stop growing and fall from the tree. Fruit may turn shades of brown to gray just before dropping.


","None needed since this is considered a normal occurrence.

",,
Cherry ,(Prunus spp.)-Leaf Spot,"Blumeriella jaapii (formerly Coccomyces hiemalis), a fungus.
The disease is particularly severe on sour cherries, but also attacks sweet cherries in western Oregon and Washington. It has been found infrequently in arid areas east of the Cascade Range. It is especially a problem in newly planted orchards that are not being sprayed for brown rot control. Resulting losses of fruit yield and quality are associated with a weakening of the tree as a result of early summer defoliation. Early defoliation delays flower bud acclimation to low temperatures in winter, which results in decreased flower bloom and fruit set for 2 years.
The fungus overwinters on fallen infected cherry leaves and in spring produces large numbers of spores. Air currents and rain move spores to healthy leaves. In spring, with moisture, they initiate new infections on young leaves through stomata. Once unfolded, leaves are susceptible throughout the growing season, but susceptibility decreases with age.
New lesions produce more spores, which can infect healthy foliage each time it rains in the spring. Fewer infection cycles occur in the PNW compared to Midwestern production areas such as Michigan. Other hosts include apricot, bitter and choke cherry and plum.


","On sour cherry leaves, variously colored spots develop on the upper surface. The spot or lesion rapidly enlarges, becoming brown or purple, and dies from the center outward. Infected spots are irregular or round and occur over the entire leaf surface. Individual spots never become large. They merge together to kill large areas of the leaf. Spot development precedes yellowing and leaf dropping. The area adjacent to the spot may remain green while the rest of the leaf turns yellow (the ""green island"" effect). Diseased leaf tissue may separate from healthy tissue, drop out, and give the leaf a shothole appearance.
On sweet cherry leaves, spots often are larger and nearly circular. Cream-colored fungal spore masses appear on the lower leaf surface associated with the spots on both sweet and sour cherries. On fruit stems, infections sometimes girdle the stem to cause a fruit drop. While infections occur on the fruit, they are less common than on foliage.


","

1) Rake up and destroy infected leaves. Leaves may be composted if completely decayed before spring.

2) Make use of any practice that encourages decomposition of leaves prior to spring bud break, such as mowing or flailing.

3) Apply urea to leaves after leaf fall in autumn to enhance decomposition of fallen leaves.

","Apply a fungicide at petal fall, shuck fall, and 2 weeks later. Postharvest applications are helpful in wet years. Rotate or tank-mix materials from different groups with different modes of action to prevent resistant strains from developing. Limit applications from any particular group to two (2) or fewer per year. Fungi resistant to Group 3 fungicides have been detected in Michigan. A forecasting program is available from Michigan to help time applications. Tests in western Oregon show the program is useful at higher temperatures.

Cherry ,(Prunus spp.)-Leafroll,,,,,
Cherry ,(Prunus spp.)-Little Cherry,"Little cherry virus (LChV) consists of two different closteroviruses that result in similar symptoms. LChV-1 and LChV-2 have been described from Oregon and Washington including a mixed infection of both viruses. A strain of LChV-2, formerly known as the Kootenay little cherry disease and as LChV-3, has been severe in many sweet cherry orchards in British Columbia. Little cherry virus can be carried by ornamental flowering cherries such as Prunus serrulata, 'Kwanzan' and 'Shirofugen' and has also been referred to as K&S disease. The host range of LChV-1 is not well understood but appears to be more widespread than LChV-2, but it is also less serious and much harder to identify visually. The apple mealybug (Phenacoccus aceris) and the grape mealybug (Pseudococcus maritimus) are vectors of LChV-2. Grafting infected scion or rootstock can also transmit the disease as well as natural root grafts. There is a one-year lag between infection and symptom development. Little cherry disease is distinct from X-disease, which has similar symptoms but is caused by a phytoplasma.
'Deacon', 'Lambert', and 'Sam' are most susceptible to little cherry disease but it also occurs in 'Bing' and 'Sweetheart.'


","Main symptoms of black cultivars are small, poorly colored fruits with poor flavor. Check the flavor of fruit on limbs or trees with pink fruit when the rest of the trees are turning red or mahogany. Some cultivars such as Lambert also develop a slightly pointed or triangular appearance. In light-color cultivars, such as Royal Ann, the fruit is small and pinkish. Trees may lose some vigor, but in general there is no visible impact on overall tree health. Some cultivars develop a premature red leaf discoloration in the fall. Cool springs may intensify symptoms. 'Bing' may exhibit small fruit for two seasons and then return to normal; however, the flavor never recovers. Fruit on 'Rainier' may look white. Trees with symptoms tend to be in pockets or groups in the orchard.
Trees infected with X-Disease will also have symptoms of little, off-colored cherries.


","

1) Establish new orchards only with nursery stock tested and found to be free of all known viruses. Virus-tested 'Kwanzan' and 'Shirofugen' trees have been released to nurseries for propagation.

2) Remove infected trees. Check the flavor of fruit on limbs or trees with pink fruit when the rest of the trees are turning red or mahogany. If poor flavor then flag the tree for removal. Also remove infected flowering cherries or wild seedlings growing near sweet or sour cherry orchards.

3) Control programs for the apple and grape mealy bug will reduce spread in affected orchards. See     for details.

Cherry ,(Prunus spp.)-Necrotic Rusty Mottle (Lambert Mottle) and Rusty Mottle,"Uncharacterized graft-transmissible pathogen(s), presumed to be viruses, that can spread by infected bud wood or graft wood. The viruses involved with these diseases are related but different. Cherry necrotic rusty mottle virus is associated with necrotic rusty mottle disease, Lambert mottle, cherry bark blister and Frogmore virus canker. Cherry rusty mottle virus is associated with mild rusty mottle and rusty mottle. These diseases spread slowly in orchards from tree to tree, but the vector is not known. They are not common problems, but they do occur in all Pacific Northwest cherry production areas.
In the orchards where Rusty mottle disease occurs, usually a large number of trees are affected. It occurs in all sweet cherry cultivars and Portuguese Laurel (Prunus lusitanica).
The cultivars Lambert and Corum are very susceptible to necrotic rusty mottle.


","Leaf symptoms can be highly variable and dependent on climatic conditions, virus isolate, and cultivar. Cool springs can result in more severe symptoms.
Necrotic Rusty Mottle - Buds on terminal shoots fail to open or swell and eventually die. Other leaves and flower buds develop irregularly and late. May get large necrotic spots on leaves in mid-spring. Yellowish interveinal mottle of older leaves in early summer followed by numerous purplish or chocolate spots, later becoming brownish. These irregular spots may partially separate at the margin from the rest of the leaf, giving the leaf a torn, ragged appearance. Twigs and larger branches sometimes die. The number of fruit spurs may be reduced and the crop subsequently reduced. Trees usually die in 1 or 2 years.
Rusty Mottle - In early spring, infected trees show no foliage symptoms. About midway between blossom and harvest, a chlorotic mottling develops on older leaves. Soon much of the foliage shows variable chlorotic rings and patterns, ultimately taking on a late-summer yellow and red coloration. Two to 3 weeks before harvest, some of the more brightly colored and severely infected foliage drops. Gradually, mottling becomes more pronounced, turning yellowish brown and giving a general rust appearance to foliage. The disease's effect on fruit apparently depends on the severity of foliage symptoms and the amount of leaf drop before harvest.


","

1) Removing trees with necrotic rusty mottle as soon as noticed has significantly reduced the disease's spread. Removal of diseased trees with rusty mottle when they are infected to the point they no longer can produce profitable crops.

2) When a large number of trees are affected, consider orchard removal.

3) Propagation material for new trees should be from certified virus-tested (and found to be free of all known viruses) bud wood only.

Cherry ,(Prunus spp.)-Phytophthora Root Rot,"Many Phytophthora species, fungus-like microorganisms, cause a root rot of stone fruits. P. cactorum is the only species reported from the Pacific Northwest and then only on apricot and peach in Washington. OSU Plant Clinic records indicate P. cactorum on cherry in the Willamette Valley of Oregon. This is not a common disease problem in Oregon because orchards are planted on well-drained hillsides. Cool, wet, or waterlogged soils favor the disease.


","Aboveground symptoms are generally slow or poor growth, which can be mistaken for other problems such as nutritional deficiencies. Root systems; however, are rotted with few if any feeder roots. In advanced cases, many roots are in various stages of decay. Cambium near the root crown shows a brownish discoloration that has a distinct border with healthy tissue.

Cherry ,(Prunus spp.)-Pitting,"There are many reasons that cherries may develop surface depressions or ""pits"" on the outside of the fruit. The most common cause is physical damage during harvest or postharvest handling. As a response to this damage pits may appear after a few days in cold storage. Some cultivars, such as Van, Lapins, and Sweetheart are more sensitive than others. The following cultivar list is from resistant to pitting to susceptible: Regina, Chelan, Bing, Skeena, Sweetheart, Lapin and Rainer. Dropping the cherry against a hard surface such as a picking bucket or during packing are common causes of pitting. This type of damage increases at lower fruit temperatures.
There are other causes for pitting. The fungi that cause brown rot or cherry leaf spot, and certain viruses (such as the Petunia asteroid mosaic virus) and even the bacterium Pseudomonas syringae can cause preharvest pitting. Harvest of over-mature fruit as well as over cropping have also been implicated in causing cherry pitting. However, fruit pitting due to these other causes is not common in the absence of the other more common factors.


","Normal appearing cherry fruit develop surface depressions that are generally circular and may be broad or sharp. Sometimes a small bit of necrotic tissue may be seen at the bottom of a pit. Pits may range in size from small subtle depressions to large depressions in the side of the fruit.


","

1) Control fungal diseases that may be prevalent in your area.

2) Harvest when fruit is at the red mahogany stage.

3) Prune Lapins and Sweetheart cultivars hard to reduce the potential for oversetting the crop.

4) Avoid dropping fruit, especially once it is chilled.

5) Six, weekly preharvest applications of chelated calcium at 0.05% calcium or Cal-8 at 0.2 calcium increased fruit calcium and decreased pitting. High rates can cause marginal leaf burn. Calcium in hydro-cooling water postharvest may also decrease pitting.

Cherry ,(Prunus spp.)-Postharvest Rots,"Many fungi. Cladosporium sp., Rhizopus rot, blue mold (Penicillium expansum), Alternaria rot, gray mold (Botrytis cinerea), and brown rot (Monilinia sp.) can occur. These rots are significantly more serious during seasons when rain-cracking occurs. Once fungal spores are deposited into these wounds, rapid fruit decay can occur. However, many of these fungi are capable of infecting healthy fruit between bloom and harvest. In Europe, plastic rain shields were found to reduce rain cracking and rots that developed before harvest.


","Alternaria rot-a firm, brown, cone-shape mass of tissue extending toward the pit. The surface may have a lot of fluffy, white, moldy growth.
Blue mold rot-circular, soft, pale brown lesions. White fungal growth with blue-green spores produced in tufts in concentric circles around the point of infection. May also have musty odor.
Brown rot-small, dark spots that enlarge rapidly. Fruit remains fairly firm and dry relative to a watery rot caused by Rhizopus sp. Production of masses of buff-color spores is equally rapid in the necrotic area.
Cladosporium rot-very similar to Alternaria rot.
Gray mold-soft, moist, pale brown lesion that produces a mass of gray-brown conidia.
Rhizopus rot-soft, watery tissue and a profuse production of coarse white fungal strands with black spore heads (sporangia).

1) Shield harvested fruit from sun and heat.

2) Put cherries in clean, dry lugs or bins. Keep plant debris and dust out of bins and keep soil off the bottoms of bins.

Cherry ,(Prunus spp.)-Powdery Mildew,"Podosphaera clandestina, a fungus that infects young, expanding leaves. It overwinters as small, round, black bodies (chasmothecia) on dead leaves, on the orchard floor, or in tree crotches. Some chasmothecia may be trapped in bark crevices. In spring as buds break, irrigation or rain releases ascospores and wind spreads them to young leaves. When the right combination of temperature and leaf wetness duration occurs, these ascospores start the first colonies of the season. Colonies produce more (asexual) spores generally around shuck fall and continue the disease cycle. Warm temperatures, high humidity, and dry leaves favor these secondary spores. The fungus can go from spore to spore in as little as 4 to 5 days under favorable conditions.
Ideal conditions for spread of the disease during late spring and summer are high humidity and temperatures from 70°F to 80°F. Vigorously growing trees with dense foliage encourages disease development.
The first few infections may be found on the leaves of sucker shoots, branches close to the ground, or leaves on main scaffold branches near tree crotches. Seedlings on the orchard floor may also be infected. Look for the first colonies about 1 week after the first irrigation. As leaves age they become more resistant to infection and disease development.
Unlike other fruit crops, flowers are not suceptble and young developing cherries are not as susceptible as older mature cherries. Conidia that land on green fruit may remain quiescent until later in the growing season. The exact trigger for fruit infection is known but specifically related to fruit maturity.
Major disease outbreaks are infrequent but potentially destructive particularly east of the Cascade Range. Most sweet and sour cherry cultivars are susceptible, but the disease is most severe on Bing. In one trial, the cultivars Lambert and Black Tartarian had a moderate level of resistance while Chelan was found immxune. Late season cultivars such as Sweetheart and Rainier seem more susceptible due to a longer growing season.


","Leaves-the first symptom is a light-green, circular lesion on either leaf surface. A subtle white cotton-like growth develops in the infected area. Mycelial growth can be sparse and difficult to detect. Early symptoms can be easier to find when the sun is over the back of your shoulder highlighting the colony. Severe leaf infection can result in curling and/or blistering, and leaves are covered with the characteristic white cotton-like growth. As infected leaves age, small, black bodies (chasmothecia) are formed.
Fruit-circular, slightly depressed areas develop late in the season on the surface.Symptoms gradually start at the stem cavity (stem/fruit attachment zone) and radiate out onto the fruit from there. A subtle white, cotton-like growth may or may not develop but can cover the entire fruit surface.


","Start looking for the first colonies about 1 week after the first irrigation.

1) Remove and destroy sucker shoots.

2) Keep irrigation water off developing fruit and leaves by using irrigation that does not wet the leaves. Also, keep irrigation sets as short as possible.

3) Follow cultural practices that promote good air circulation, such as pruning, and moderate shoot growth through judicious nitrogen management.

","Begin at shuck fall and continue through harvest. Significant rain between budbreak and shuck fall warrants an application as soon as possible. Resistance to Group 3 fungicides is highly suspected in eastern Washington and mid-Columbia areas. Alternate or tank-mix products from different groups that have different modes of action. Also, limit applications from any particular group to two (2) or fewer per year. A temperature-based computer model can help time reapplications. Do not use products on long 21-day intervals.

Cherry ,(Prunus spp.)-Prune Dwarf,"Prune dwarf virus (PDV) is transmitted easily by budding and grafting. It also spreads naturally in the orchard by infected pollen. Thus, there is little spread until trees are old enough to bloom. Spread in sweet cherry is much slower than in sour cherry. Due to pollen transmission, a high percentage of the seeds may carry the virus. PDV may cause up to 50% yield loss in sour cherry, low bud-take in nurseries (40% to 50% compared with healthy stocks) and slower growth of young trees.


","Sweet cherry leaves are normal color and vigor but narrower and longer than usual. Although the virus is distributed throughout an infected tree, symptoms may be restricted to one limb or section of the tree. Blind wood also occurs and is frequently seen in trees 25 years or older. Fruit production, although reduced, is on the exterior of the tree. Being more exposed, fruit usually is larger and firmer than fruit grown toward the interior of the tree. Applying gibberellic acid can reverse the development of blind wood.


","

1) Use virus-tested (and found to be free of all known viruses) bud wood and nursery stock.

2) Establish new plantings some distance from older orchards. Do not rogue or replant extensively in older orchards where yellows are established. However, do rogue in young newly infected orchards if diseased trees occasionally show up.

3) Apply gibberellic acid.

4) Thermotherapy (24 to 32 days at 38°C) and/or apical meristem culture have been used to eliminate various viruses.

",,
Cherry ,(Prunus spp.)-Prunus Necrotic Ringspot,"Prunus necrotic ringspot virus (PNRSV), which has many strains that have produced variously named diseases over the years including necrotic ringspot, tatter leaf peach ringspot, recurrent ringspot, cherry rugose mosaic, rose mosaic, and almond calico. PNRSV is responsible for yield losses of up to 15% in sweet cherry and up to 100% in peach. PNRSV can reduce bud-take in nurseries, decrease growth of fruit (10% to 30%) and fruit yield (20% to 60%), delay fruit maturity, and increase susceptibility to winter injuries in orchards.
The PNRSV is transmitted easily by budding and grafting. It also spreads naturally in the orchard by infected pollen. Thus, there is little spread until trees are old enough to bloom. In the Pacific Northwest, most orchard trees are infected with PNRSV by 20 years of age. Spread in sweet cherry is much slower than in sour cherry. Due to pollen transmission, a high percentage of the seed may carry the virus. PNRSV infects naturally all Prunus spp. including both cultivated and wild species but also hop and rose.


","Shock symptoms, followed by chronic symptoms, are produced in trees not already infected. The occurrence of shock symptoms apparently depends on climatic conditions. The number of virus strains and the difference in tolerance of host species results in unlimited variations in symptoms.
Symptoms generally consist of chlorosis, necrosis, leaf deformity, and stunting. Entire plants may be affected, or only a portion may show symptoms. Normal PNRSV symptoms consist of a few rings or chlorotic areas that may develop into severe necrotic spotting and a shothole appearance. Careful inspection of sweet cherry trees in late spring may reveal scattered older leaves or entire spurs with necrotic spotting or etched rings. Sometimes one branch will show tattered leaves or symptoms of the rugose mosaic strain. Yield on trees infected with the normal strain is reduced about 5%.
The cherry rugose mosaic strain produces ""boating"" and turned-up leaf tips, delayed fruit maturity (up to 3 weeks), and enations (ridges of rasp-like growth) on undersides of leaves. Leaves with enations are often thicker and stiffer than normal leaves. Severe monetary loss occurs from delayed maturity of the fresh market cultivars such as Bing and Lambert. Smaller losses occur from the delayed maturity of fruits for the brine trade. Trees infected with the rugose mosaic strain set a very light crop that matures late.


","

1) Use nursery stock that has been tested and found to be free of all known viruses.

2) If propagating your own trees, use both virus-indexed bud wood and virus-certified rootstock.

3) Infected pollen should not be introduced into healthy orchards during pollination.

4) Establish new plantings in blocks, the larger the better, and preferably at some distance from older orchards.

5) Rogue infected trees in new virus-indexed orchards, but it is not economical to rogue or replant mature infected orchards unless trees are infected with the rugose strain. Complete orchard removal should be considered.

6) Thermotherapy (24 to 32 days at 38°C) and/or apical meristem culture have been used to eliminate various viruses.

Cherry ,(Prunus spp.)-Rasp Leaf,"Cherry rasp leaf virus (CRLV) is readily transmitted by grafting and by dagger nematodes. Several weeds such as dandelion and red raspberry also are hosts. The virus also spreads to apples where it induces flat apple disease. The virus has been found in eastern Washington and on apple in Hood River Oregon.


","Prominent projections (enations) are found on undersides of leaves. These take the shape of leafy outgrowths or raised protuberances between lateral veins and along the midrib. Leaves are more or less deformed; many are extremely narrow, folded, and distorted. Upper surfaces have a rough, pebbly texture with depressions corresponding to projections on the lower surface. Not all parts of a tree show symptoms at the same time. Early infections usually are limited to low branches. Spread is slow within a tree and between trees. Fruit production is reduced. Severely affected branches and young trees may die.


","

1) Use nursery stock that has been tested and found to be free of all known viruses.

2) Remove infected trees as soon as symptoms are seen.

3) Control the nematode vector.

4) Thermo therapy has been effective in apple.

Cherry ,(Prunus spp.)-Replant Disease,"A complex of biological and environmental factors that varies by geographic region. Although more research has been done on apple replant disease, cherry replant disease is considered to be very similar in its overall epidemiology. Contributing factors in cherry replant disease include Pratylenchus penetrans (root-lesion nematode), inadequate soil or orchard management, and winter injury. Additionally, Cytospora canker, Mesocriconema sp. (ring nematode), and Pseudomonas syringae (bacterial canker) are typically associated with Peach Tree Shortlife and may be also be factors. Limited evidence also suggests that cherry replant disease may also occur when planting back into old pome fruit orchards.


","Replant disease has no definite symptoms other than poor tree growth the first few years after transplanting. Vigorous young trees planted in a problem site stop growing in early summer. Affected trees leaf out each spring but produce little or no shoot growth. Few new lateral or feeder roots are produced, and existing roots discolor and deteriorate.


","

1) Avoid by not planting  sp. on ground where old  or pome fruit orchards have recently been removed. Rotations of 5 to 8 years are recommended.

2) Correct soil physical characteristics that are detrimental to growing cherry trees.

3) Use of a summer rotation with 'Piper' sudangrass was helpful in California but not as good as fumigation.

","Preplant fumigation. Consult or hire a professional applicator to be sure it is done safely and effectively.


1) Basamid G. Avoid application when soil is over 90°F. Do not apply within 3 to 4 feet of growing plants or closer than the drip line of larger plants. Do not harvest within one year of application. 5-day reentry..

2) Metam-sodium products such as Metam CLR (42%), Sectagon 42 or Vapam HL. Vapam HL can be used at 56 to 75 gal/A. Use in enough water to penetrate only 3 ft. or 6 ft for individual tree treatment. Remove as much tree root debris as possible before application. Trees adjacent to the treatment site may be injured. 48-hr reentry. .

3) Telone C-17 at 32.4 to 42 gal/A depending on soil type and depth of penetration. 5-day reentry. .

Cherry ,(Prunus spp.)-Rosette,"This problem is apparently related to low levels of boron in early spring. A virus was implicated but never found.


","Poor growth and off-color generally show in time when affected trees or branches have smaller unopened green buds on shorter stems. Eventually, blossom buds open but soon abscise at the pedicel base, leaving a ring of persistent green bud scales.
As new leaves form, they are narrow, delayed in expanding, and form a cluster of small leaves due to the slow elongation of the terminal growth. As terminals grow, trees appear more normal, but severely affected branches or trees will show long, narrow, or short-cupped leaves as well as normal leaves.


",,"Rosette can be reduced or cured by bringing the boron level into a normal range for cherry. Apply to leaves in September.

Cherry ,(Prunus spp.)-Silver Leaf,"Chondrostereum purpureum, a fungus that attacks shoots, branches, trunks, and roots. In Oregon, the disease has been a problem in some sour cherry and prune orchards. It is known also to affect sweet cherries, apples, apricot, pears, peaches, plums, nectarines, some small fruits (such as blueberry), alder, willow and poplar.
The fungus is a saprophyte growing on dead trees, prunings, stumps, posts, and fallen logs. It can become an active parasite by entering living tissue through a fresh surface wound such as pruning cuts, mechanical injury, winter injury, and insect damage. Pruning cuts are most susceptible within 1 week of wounding. After infection, fungus growth is systemic.


","A silvering of the leaves usually shows first on one or two small branches, extending rapidly to affect all branches on a limb and eventually to all limbs on the tree. The silver leaves become ashy colored, sometimes tinged with green, and edges tend to curl slightly. The leaves' light color shows a marked contrast to the normal dark green of healthy leaves. Soon after leaves silver, the branch begins to decline in vigor and dies either the same season or after one or several seasons during which leaves continue to silver.
As the branch declines in vigor, leaves fall prematurely until the branch is bare and stands out prominently. The branch usually dies after infection, but trees have been known to recover. After the branch dies, the fruiting structure of the fungus pushes its way through the dead bark and takes the shape of a bracket fungus. Brackets are quite variable in form. They appear either as flat incrustations up to several inches long covering the branches' undersides or the sides of the trunk, or as bracket-shaped projections, 1 to 3 inches wide, arranged in tiers. Bracket undersurfaces, the sporulating surfaces, usually are purple although color may vary from salmon pink to purple.


","

1) Burn all prunings. The fungus will fruit only on dead wood, and pruning piles are often the source of reinfection.

2) Take care to prevent unnecessary injuries to trees. Use proper branch pruning techniques.

3) If the disease is present, immediately treat all wounded and cut surfaces to prevent infection.

4) Prune trees in dry weather.

","Injection of fungicides into diseased trees does not have an affect on disease progression. Chemical protection of pruning wounds is possible but there are no chemical registrations.


","The fungus Trichoderma viride has been shown to protect pruning wounds but there are no registrations.


"
Cherry ,(Prunus spp.)-Sour Cherry Yellows,"Prune dwarf virus (PDV) is transmitted easily by budding and grafting. It also spreads naturally in the orchard by infected pollen. Thus, there is little spread until trees are old enough to bloom. Spread in sweet cherry is much slower than in sour cherry. Due to pollen transmission, a high percentage of the seeds may carry the virus.


","Early descriptions of symptoms were of trees infected with contaminating viruses such as Prunus necrotic ringspot virus and Green ring mottle virus. Leaf yellowing may appear the first year the tree is infected, but usually symptoms do not develop for several years. Symptom expression is most favorable about 2 weeks after night temperatures of 50°F to 60°F and day temperatures of 86°F to 95°F. Affected foliage is a green and yellow mottle with the green along the midrib and larger veins. These leaves drop, and a second or third wave of symptoms may occur. Eventually, 30% to 50% of the leaves may drop. Fruiting spurs are reduced so that infected trees develop a willowy growth habit with long bare branches. Yield is high quality but may be reduced by 50%. Tree decline is accelerated in the presence of Prunus necrotic ringspot virus.


","

1) Use nursery stock that has been tested and found to be free of all known viruses.

2) If propagating your own trees, use both virus-indexed budwood and virus-certified rootstock.

3) Do not introduce infected pollen into healthy orchards during pollination.

4) Establish new plantings in blocks, the larger the better, and preferably at some distance from older orchards.

5) Rogue infected trees in new virus-indexed orchards, but it is not economical to rogue or replant mature infected orchards.

6) Thermotherapy (24 to 32 days at 38°C) and/or apical meristem culture have been used to eliminate various viruses.

",,
Cherry ,(Prunus spp.)-Stem Pitting,"Several causes have been linked with stem pitting symptoms. Tomato ringspot virus is associated with a disease known as Prunus stem pitting and is vectored by the dagger nematode. Tomato bushy stunt virus has been associated with the disease in other parts of North America. An unknown graft-transmitted agent has been observed in California and is suspected to be in the Pacific Northwest. The cultivars Bing and Mazzard show severe symptoms, while Mahaleb shows less conspicuous wood marking. The cultivar Colt reacts to Tomato ringspot virus with a hypersensitive reaction, thus preventing movement of the virus away from the site of nematode transmission into the scion.


","Premature defoliation from the lower portion of the tree is an initial symptom. Severe pitting (longitudinal depressions) can be found in the woody cylinder of the scion and/or rootstock. Thick, spongy bark, ridges and furrows in the trunk, cambial necrosis, and necrotic streaking in the wood have also been associated with stem pitting. The cultivar Bing exhibits sparse canopies, unmarketable fruit, limb dieback, and eventually tree death. The virus is latent in the cultivar Royal Ann such that pitting is only observed in the rootstock.


","

1) Plant certified nursery stock.

2) Remove diseased trees.

3) Use colt rootstock.

",,
Cherry ,(Prunus spp.)-Verticillium Wilt,"Verticillium dahliae, a soilborne fungus that may remain viable in soil for years. The fungus forms microsclerotia within infected tissues. Once in the soil they germinate and infect roots. The fungus grows into the xylem where it colonizes the plant through mycelial growth and conidial production. Fluid movement in the xylem passively transports the conidia. Once in the xylem, this fungus partially blocks water movement and produces toxins that result in wilt symptoms. The disease usually affects young trees coming into bearing but may be found on older trees. Verticillium wilt affects numerous plants including apricot, lambsquarters, nightshade, peach, pepper, phlox, potato, raspberry, shepherdspurse, strawberry, and tomato. Plant-parasitic nematodes also can increase disease incidence and severity.


","Some lower leaves yellow, and later so do higher leaves; often, twigs and branches also wilt and die. East of the Cascade Range, leaves may turn reddish-orange. Spurs and twigs may die so rapidly that leaves remain attached. Leaves of current-season shoots and older wood may drop off or be less numerous than on healthy trees, giving trees an open or bare appearance. Discoloration (brown-red) in sapwood of some diseased twigs and branches can be observed by cutting into the branches with a pocket knife.


","Trees have recovered after proper cultural care.

1) Do not plant orchards in soils where -susceptible crops (see above) have been grown previously.

2) Do not interplant with -susceptible crops.

3) Control weeds.

4) Avoid excessive irrigation, severe pruning, or other measures that promote succulent growth.

5) Research on control of Verticillium wilt in other crops indicates that nitrogenous fertilizers should be used at minimum rates-sufficient only to provide normal growth. One test in British Columbia showed that reducing ammonium nitrate from 6 to 2 lb per cherry tree did not reduce terminal growth but did allow trees to recover from the disease.

6) Remove and destroy symptomatic or dead branches preferably before leaves fall and thus before new inoculum gets incorporated into the ground.

7) Clean pruning equipment after use.

",,
Cherry ,(Prunus spp.)-Virus-induced Cherry Decline,"One of the causes of virus-induced decline of sweet cherry trees is Cherry leafroll virus. The symptoms become much more severe when the infection is in combination with Prune dwarf virus, Prunus necrotic ringspot virus or American plum line pattern virus. Although Cherry leafroll virus belongs to a group of viruses that are nematode transmitted, there are no known nematode vectors present in the Pacific Northwest. How it is transmitted is unknown but evidence points to root grafts. The disease has spread more rapidly than expected in the Yakima Valley of WA and is now found with increasing frequency in all cherry production areas of eastern WA. Many infected trees have been removed. The disease was first found in Oregon in 2016.
'Bing' scion infection resulted in a hypersensitive reaction of 'Colt' or 'Gisela 6' rootstocks killing the tree.


","Alone, Cherry leafroll virus causes delayed flowering. Virus infection promotes a heavy set of fruit that matures late and ripens poorly yielding small, light-color fruit, which often is unmarketable. Also, an early leaf drop begins just after bloom, leaving the tree with a sparse, open canopy. Young shoots tend to die back over winter, and many buds fail to develop, leaving blind wood.
In combination with Prune dwarf virus, leaves develop enations along the midrib resembling rugose disease, and the fruit symptoms increase. With Prunus necrotic ringspot virus and American plum line pattern virus, the tree's decline is accelerated. Dieback of young growth and blind wood weakens the trees rapidly. In combination with midsummer defoliation, the trees are severely weakened and die within 3 to 5 years.


","

1) Use only planting material certified as virus-tested and found to be free of all known viruses.

2) Prevent secondary spread via root grafts by using a resistant/tolerant rootstock such as 'Colt' or 'Krymsk 5'.

3) Rogue infected trees as soon as possible. First, have the tree positively identified as infected with the virus. Next, apply a general insecticide to kill possible insect or mite vectors. Remove the tree at the ground line. Treat the trunk with herbicide to kill the roots (sucker sprouts would still be infected). Some herbicide damage may be observed in adjacent trees due to root grafts.

Cherry ,(Prunus spp.)-Witches' Broom,"Taphrina wiesneri,  on cherry, T. confusa on Chokcherry, and T. flavorubra on Western Sand Cherry, fungi. Ascospores from diseased leaves fall on buds and, upon germinating, penetrate the branch, stimulating it to abnormal growth year after year. Once a branch is infected, it will always remain so, and the leaves on the ""broom"" will be diseased every year. In Oregon, the disease is only on sweet cherry trees.


","Large, broom-like tufts develop on branches. They are easily distinguished at blossom time: they have few flowers and become leafy earlier than normal branches. Brooms do not bear fruit. At the base of the witches' broom is a common stem, which may be much thicker than the branch to which it is attached. Long, slender branches grow from this stem. Affected leaves somewhat resemble peach leaves affected by peach leaf curl-thick, reddish, with a white growth of fungus (asci) on the undersurface.

Cherry ,(Prunus spp.)-Wood Decay,,,,,
Cherry ,(Prunus spp.)-X-Disease,"A phytoplasma sometimes called cherry buckskin in California or albino in Oregon. Candidatus Phytoplasma pruni is the suggested scientific name for the Western X disease phytoplasma. X-Disease can be transmitted by budding or grafting, but because the disease is unevenly distributed in the tree, a fair number of buds will not carry the organism. Bud wood held in storage frequently will not transmit the disease. Leafhoppers spread the organisms in the orchard; Colladonus geminatus (and maybe C. reductus) appears the most common vector. Attempts to control the disease's spread with insecticides for leafhopper control have been unsuccessful.
X-Disease has not been reported in the Willamette Valley of Oregon but was widespread in Wasco county and found in Umatilla and Malheur counties. The disease has been found in several eastern Washington locations and has increased in incidence in the 2010's. Several Prunus species are hosts including peach, plum, bitter cherry, and choke cherry.


","Fruits are small, pointed, often flat-sided, and pale-red to greenish-white. Normal appearing fruit may be interspersed with affected fruit. Fruit lack maturity, flavor and/or sugar development. Affected fruit often is confined to a small portion of the tree; the rest of the tree bears normal fruit. Leaves on terminals are slightly rosetted and become bronze or rusty several weeks earlier than healthy trees. A late growth flush may develop from normally dormant buds. In sour cherries, older infected twigs and branches may have considerable dieback. The albino strain is not known to go to peaches. Cherry on Mahaleb rootstock develops pits and groves between the scion and rootstock, forming a dark line under the bark.
Trees infected with Little cherry virus will also have symptoms of little, off-colored poor tasting cherries.


","

1) When X-Disease first appears, spray trees thoroughly to kill the vectors, and then remove infected trees. However, if many trees are infected, this may not be economically advisable because infected trees still can produce fruit that looks healthy.

2) Trees on Mahaleb are very susceptible and usually die within a few years. Trees on Mazzard show symptoms for many years but seldom die.

3) Remove wild chokecherry ( ) or other hosts that can be a reservoir of the pathogen in the vicinity.

Cherry ,(Prunus spp.)-Yellow Bud Mosaic,"The yellow bud mosaic strain of Tomato ringspot virus is vectored by the dagger nematode and associated with diseases known as Eola rasp leaf or Peach yellow bud mosaic. The disease has been found on 'Royal Ann' in the Willamette Valley, 'Rainer' in The Dalles and on 'Bing' in Hood River and The Dalles. Mahaleb or mazzard rootstock can become infected. Peach and almond also show symptoms while apricot is not seriously damaged (but can still be a reservoir of this virus strain). Many weeds can also be hosts of the virus. Disease spread in the orchard has been slow. Trees become unproductive.


","Declining trees have a bare-limb appearance that starts in the lower portion of the tree and moves upward, year after year, as spurs twigs and small branches die. Many shoots on affected limbs have a rosetted appearance. Spur leaves are small with prominent, whitish secondary veins that branch off from the midrib at right angles. Enations (small epidermal outgrowths) develop on the underside of these leaves adjacent to the midrib. In contrast to rasp leaf disease, enations are smaller and fewer and caused less leaf distortion. Along with enations, Royal Ann leaves develop dense tomentose areas between twisted distorted veins. Unlike other strains of TomRSV, trunks may develop only scattered pockets of shallow pits in the vascular cambium area.

"Cherry, Flowering ",(Prunus spp.)-Bacterial Canker,"Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae, a bacterium. The disease is common west of the Cascade Range because it is favored by cool, wet weather. Bacterial canker causes severe damage under favorable environmental conditions. Two common genetic traits increase the bacteria's ability to cause disease. Most produce a powerful plant toxin, syringomycin, which destroys plant tissues as bacteria multiply in a wound. Bacteria also produce a protein that acts as an ice nucleus, increasing frost wounds that bacteria easily colonize and expand.


","Infected buds may fail to open in spring. Small, greasy-looking spots appear on newly opened leaves. The spots turn a dark brown and eventually may fall out, leaving a shothole appearance. In wet weather, the spots may expand and kill terminal shoots of susceptible cultivars. Shoots may appear blackened. Cankers may develop on branches. Leaves of branches may wilt during hot weather and turn brown. When infection becomes systemic, leaves of infected trees emerge smaller and yellower than leaves of healthy trees. Decline and death of the tree may follow.
Prunus sargentii 'Rancho' and P. yedoenis 'Akebono' appear to have some resistance. 'Kwanzan' cherries appear to be resistant when mature but not when young.


","

1) If practical, destroy old seedling cherry trees growing in low areas. These trees can be a source of inoculum.

2) Prune out cankered branches in summer or in dry weather late in the dormant season. Disinfect pruning tools between cuts using 10% bleach or 70% rubbing alcohol or shellac thinner.

3) Replace severely infected trees with resistant cultivars.

Chestnut ,(Castanea spp.)-Blight,"Cryphonectria parasitica (formerly Endothia parasitica), a fungus. American and European chestnuts, including chinquapin (Castabiosus sp.), are susceptible. Chinese and Japanese chestnuts have some resistance to the disease. It has been reported from all Pacific Coast States and provinces but is not commonly found. Latest report for Oregon was in 1934 in an orchard near Gunter. Oregon continues to quarantine all Castanea (Chestnut) and Castanopsis (Chinquapins) spp. from Eastern States, which must be certified free of blight before entering the state.
This disease was introduced into North America and Europe from East Asia. First reported in New York in 1904 it spread quickly taking the American chestnut (Castanea dentata) from a dominant forest tree species to a small component of the understory. The European chestnut (C. sativa) was not quite as susceptible but it was nonetheless equally devasted. In Europe it was noticed that in some cases this perennial canker that killed trees was not perennial, began to heal over and did not kill trees. It was discovered that the fungus was not as virulent because it was infected by any of several viruses, a phenomenon called hypovirulence.
Inoculation of these hypovirulent fungi into regular cankers would transmit the virus(es) to the ""healthy"" fungi and cankers would start to heal. In some situations the virus would spread locally slowing the progress of the disease through the trees. Hypovirulence has controlled chestnut blight well in some locations in Europe and in Michigan but has failed almost completely in eastern North America. Where effective, the incidence of the disease remains high but the severity is much less.


","Slightly sunken or swollen cankers on branches or trunk. Cankers are yellow-brown and oval to irregular in shape. Leaves wilt, turn yellow or brown, and remain attached when cankers girdle the tree. Water sprouts may develop below the cankered area. The canker may contain many orange, pimple-like fruiting bodies (pycnidia) that produce yellow to orange masses of spores during wet weather.


","Quickly remove infected trees after a positive diagnosis from a reputable laboratory.

",,"Although hypovirulence is interesting, there is so little disease in the PNW that if it occurs the trees should be removed rather than letting the disease spread.

","Leaf and stem lesions initially are chlorotic, usually necrotic, and numerous. Developing lesions tend to coalesce and cause blight (death) of all aboveground plant parts. The fungus produces dark fruiting bodies (pycnidia), often arranged in concentric rings within developing lesions on leaves, stems, and pods. In the field, blight first appears in small patches in lowlands or under sprinkler irrigation. With available moisture and wind to disperse spores, the blight may spread to the entire field.

Chickpea ,(Garbanzo Bean) (Cicer sp.)-Sclerotinia Stem Rot (White Mold),"The fungi, Sclerotinia sclerotiorum and S. trifoliorum, can cause stem rot of chickpea. Both fungi overwinter as small black structures (sclerotia) in soil. Sclerotia may survive 5 to 8 years in the soil. After a conditioning period of several weeks at 40°F in moist soil, sclerotia can germinate in moist soil when temperatures are 59°F to 65°F and produce a small, stalked, cup-shaped fruiting structure (apothecium; plural: apothecia), which releases millions of spores into the air. Sporulating apothecia can persist 5 to 10 days. Spores are forcibly ejected and a few may be blown up to a mile but most land nearby. Spores can survive 2 weeks. Under moist conditions, spores may infect senescent tissue such as blossoms and leaves or may germinate and colonize plant debris. After colonizing blossoms or senescing leaves, the fungus can invade any healthy part of the plant it contacts. Moist conditions within the plant canopy favor infection. Rain, dew, and/or irrigation practices that keep foliage wet for long periods favor white mold development.
Other host plants of S. sclerotiorum number around 400 plant species, including dry and snap bean, pea, lettuce, carrot, cabbage and other crucifers, parsnip, potato, sunflower, radish, and cucurbits while dandelion (Taraxacum officinale) is a very susceptible weed host. The major host plants for S. trifoliorum include alfalfa and clover.


","The first symptom is usually discoloration of the stem. Either fungus may invade the stem near the soil line or approximately 6 inches above the ground, girdling of the stem aboveground, followed by wilt symptoms and death of the entire plant. A fluffy, white mold may be found on the surrounding soil surface or lower stem when plants are infected at the soil line and such plants frequently have black sclerotia associated with external tissues or surrounding soil. When stems are affected higher up, rarely are sclerotia or the white, moldy growth visible.


","

1) Plant on spacing that allows better air circulation between plants, thus permitting better drying of the soil surface and plant canopy and providing unfavorable environmental conditions for . Space plants for good aeration between and within rows and orient to the prevailing wind if the placement of irrigation equipment allows.

2) Do not over-irrigate. After seeds start to form, allow soil surface to dry out before irrigating again or cease irrigation altogether.

3) Apply adequate nitrogen for crop needs, but not apply excessive fertilizer that leads to dense, lush plant growth that is favorable for .

4) Plowing deeply to bury sclerotia may be beneficial once the pathogen is in a field, but plowing the field in later years may return viable sclerotia to the surface where they can produce apothecia.

5) Practice crop rotation by growing nonsusceptible crops (onions, grasses, cereals) for 8 to 9 years, before planting susceptible crops (alfalfa, clover, bean, lettuce, potato, crucifers, celery, etc.).

","Applications after the disease is widespread in the field will not satisfactorily control the disease.

Chicory ,(Cichorium species),,,,,
Christmas Cactus ,(Schlumbergera spp.)-Stem and Root Rots,"Several organisms can cause lower stem and root rots on these holiday cacti including Fusarium oxysporum, Pythium spp., and Phytophthora sp. The OSU Plant Clinic has found Fusarium.
Fusarium survives in the soil as thick-walled, dormant chlamydospores, which germinate in response to exudates from nearby plant roots. Hyphae then penetrate the roots, colonize the cortex, and move into the xylem tissue. The fungus can attach wounded or non-wounded plants. Small spores, microconidia, are produced and carried up into the plant.
Both Pythium and Phytophthora are oomycetes and are strongly favored by abundant moisture especially in poorly drained potting media. They can survive in dust, planting media, or soil particles on greenhouse floors, flats, and pots. Wood benches can also be a reservoir. Spread can also occur via movement of infected plants. Damaged plants are more easily infected. Pythium can enter roots damaged by high-soluble salts, either from overfertilization or from letting the rooting medium dry out, even for short periods, during propagation.


","
Fusarium - Water-soaked lesions first occur with reddish-brown margins. The tissue then dries to a paper-thin tan. Upper portions of the plant wilt when cut off from functioning roots.
Pythium - Feeder roots become brown and soft rotted where the cortex easily separates from the vascular system. The plant wilts in later stages of disease development.
Phytophthora - Plants collapse and show brown lesions at the base of the plant.


","

1) Do not overwater plants.

2) Provide good drainage for plants in containers.

3) Avoid reusing pots or trays from a previous crop for propagation. If pots must be reused then wash off all debris and soak in a sanitizing solution or treat with aerated steam for 30 min.

Chrysanthemum,Aster Yellows,"Candidatus Phytoplasma asteris, formerly referred to as a mycoplasma-like organism (MLO), which is spread naturally by a leafhopper insect. Leafhoppers may take several days to acquire the phytoplasma while feeding on infected plants. It takes several more days or up to a month before they can spread the pathogen to healthy plants. The disease is common to many plants, particularly those in the composite group, including chrysanthemums and asters.


","Very noticeable when the flowers produced on chrysanthemum are green (virescent) instead of the normal color for the cultivar. Sometimes the flowering stem's upper branches are thin, pale or yellowish, and more upright than usual. A number of thin, weak shoots bearing tiny leaves may rise from the base of the plant.

Chrysanthemum,Crown Gall,"The bacterium Agrobacterium tumefaciens enters plants through wounds, either natural or caused by pruning, grafting, mechanical injury, chewing insects, or the emergence of lateral roots. Galls can occur at sites of lateral shoot removal or pinching of terminals. The bacteria can be systemic in plants. After the bacterium enters a wound, a small piece of its DNA is transferred into the plant's DNA. The foreign DNA transforms normal plant cells in the wounded area into tumor cells. Once transformed, tumor cells proliferate automatically. The result is a gall: a disorganized mass of hyperplastic and hypertrophic tissue. Galls break down in the soil and release bacteria, which can be transported by moving media or water. These bacteria are viable in galled tissue and infected plants for 6 to 8 weeks. Galls on roots or stems disrupt the normal flow of water and nutrients and can lead to reduced growth. Many plants in 90 families are susceptible but woody perennials such as stone and pome fruit, caneberries (such as blackberry and raspberry), euonymus, Photinia, poplar, rose, walnut, and willow are typically infected.


","Galls are often at or just below the soil surface in the basal or root crown region and can reach 1.5 to 2 inches in size. They may frequently be on roots, less frequently on aerial plant parts such as stems and leaves. Galls are usually rounded with a rough, irregular surface. They first appear as small protuberances on the plant surface. Young, actively developing galls are light green or nearly white, and the tissue is soft. As they age, galls become dark and woody. Sometimes galls have a rather smooth surface, which makes it difficult to distinguish between gall and callus growth, especially if the gall is at the base of an unrooted cutting.
Galls can occur on leaves on lateral or mid-veins and appear smooth, light tan-colored usually less than 0.25 inch in size. Galls can occur on both sides of the leaf.


","

1) Use only pathogen-free nursery stock. Inspect new plants; do not plant any that have galls.

2) Avoid wounding plants, especially at planting.

3) Disinfect cutting equipment frequently. Clean shears and long soak times improve the disinfectant's efficacy.

4) Scout for and destroy affected plants including potting media and pots.

Chrysanthemum,Verticillium Wilt,"Verticillium dahliae, a soilborne fungus that enter through roots, invade the stem's xylem system, and cut off the water supply. Toxins are also produced, which, along with xylem occlusion, result in wilt symptoms. After the plant dies, the fungus colonizes the plant tissues and produces persistent survival structures. The disease is found most often in outdoor chrysanthemums, but greenhouse chrysanthemums also may be attacked.


","Foliage yellows and wilts conspicuously, especially near the margins, then leaves brown and die from the base of the plant upward. Infected plants are stunted and often fail to produce flowers. In other cases, the general wilting of the entire plant does not occur; instead, interveinal tissue in leaves becomes a pale yellow-green and finally brown. Discolored brown areas also appear in stems.


","

1) In the greenhouse, sterilize soil previously used for growing mums. Steam 30 min. at 140°F. Or use a sterile soilless potting mix.

2) Obtain cuttings only from healthy plants.

3) Use resistant cultivars when possible.

4) Rogue diseased plants early.

Chrysanthemum,White Rust,"Puccinia horiana, a microcyclic rust. This federally quarantined disease was rarely reported until the early 1990s when several California nurseries reported problems. It has been found and eradicated in several nurseries in the greater Portland, OR area off and on since 1995 and in British Columbia since 2001. Usually it is found in nurseries that 'hold-over' mums from the previous growing season. The fungus can be systemic in the root crowns of some cultivars allowing overwintering in many areas. High humidity, free water, and moderate temperatures (63°F is optimum) favor the fungus. Teliospores are killed by 80% relative humidity for only 5 min. Telia may survive up to 8 weeks on dry leaves unless they are buried, in which case they last only 1 week. Spores produced in telia can be blown by the wind and reinfect chrysanthemum up to 0.5 mile away. Splashing water and human handling can also spread spores. Germ tubes, arising from basidiospores, penetrate the host epidermis directly without appressoria. No alternate host is known. Any green tissue of the plant can be infected, but younger leaves are most susceptible.
Florists', hardy, and garden chrysanthemums are highly susceptible. Variations in host range have been detected, which suggests two or more races of the fungus.The following cultivars were observed to have little damage from this disease: Albert Heijn (Royal and White), Finmark, Freedom, Hawaii, Helsinki, Kes, Majesty, Paso Doble, Statesman (also had little damage from several insect problems), Tiger, Tigerrag, and Westland (Winter and Yellow).


","Small, pale green to yellow spots develop on upper leaf surfaces. On the undersides, buff to pink pustules (telia) form. Pustules turn white with age (production of basidiospores) and eventually become necrotic late in fall. Portions of the leaf may fall out, giving a shothole or tattered appearance. Severe infections may result in premature defoliation. Early symptoms are similar to brown rust.
If you think you have this disease please call the USDA APHIS PPQ office in Portland, OR and/or the ODA Invasive species hotline (1-800-INVADER).


","

1) Carefully inspect all cuttings and/or cut flowers coming into your operation. Imported plants should be isolated from any growing areas.

Clover ,(Trifolium spp.)-Clover Broom-rape,"Orobanche minor (clover broom-rape) is a federally listed noxious weed that has quarantine significance to many of Oregon's trading partners.
From 1923 to 1997, there have been 6 reports of clover broom-rape in Oregon. In 1998, clover broom-rape was identified in a single field. In 2000, clover broom-rape was found in 15 fields in northwestern Oregon. Native species of broom-rape can be found in all parts of Oregon.
Clover broom-rape reproduces and spreads only by seed. One broom-rape plant produces up to 500,000 dust-like seeds that may be dispersed by wind, machinery, contaminated seed crops, animals, or clothing. Flowering plants that are hand-pulled may still mature and produce viable seed. Seed can remain dormant in the soil for 10 years or more. After germination, clover broom-rape attaches to and penetrates the root of the host plant, disrupting nutrient and water transport in the host root system. Parasitism by clover broom-rape may reduce host crop yield, and, in heavy infestations, kill the host plant.
Red clover is currently the only host in Oregon but greenhouse studies have identified several other weed and crop species that can be clover broom-rape hosts. Clover broom-rape germinated and attached to nasturtium, arrowleaf clover, subterranean clover, white clover, sweet pea, lettuce, snap bean, sunflower, and carrot.


","Annual or perennial, yellowish, brown or purplish root parasites that lack chlorophyll. Stems are simple or branched and fleshy and bare scale-like leaves. Flowers racemose or solitary, white, yellow-white, or slightly purple, resembling a snapdragon.

Clover ,(Trifolium spp.)-Common Leaf Spot,"Pseudopeziza trifolii, a fungus. It attacks red clover primarily but also white and crimson species. Leaf spot occurs throughout the growing season but is most severe in fall. Long-term infections may reduce plant vigor and contribute to winter injury. The fungus survives in plant residue. No resistant cultivars are known; tetraploid cultivars are more susceptible than diploids.


","Leaf spots are dark brown to black with irregular or fringed edges. Spots are on both leaf surfaces. Fruiting structures (raised disks) appear on the upper surface and ooze an amber liquid under moist conditions. Lesions on petioles are rare.


","

1) Cut early to minimize leaf loss and to reduce inoculum.

","Foliar fungicides effectively reduce disease severity and may be considered for clover seed crops.

",
Clover ,(Trifolium spp.)-Damping-off,"The soilborne fungi or fungus-like microorganisms, Fusarium spp., Pythium spp. and Rhizoctonia solani, may attack before, during, and after germination. In the Pacific Northwest, Pythium spp. are the major cause of pre- and post-emergence damping-off of young clover seedlings. Pythium is favored by cool, wet soils. Rhizoctonia solani is more often associated with post-emergence damping-off of older seedlings and soil temperatures are warm; it is favored by warmer soil temperatures. These fungi can survive several years in soil and can infect other plant species including beans and other vegetable crops. Red clover becomes more resistant to these soilborne pathogens after plants reach the 4- or 5-leaf stage.


","Seeds either do not emerge, or emerged seedlings often develop blackened stems and wilt. Very few infected seedlings survive and root die-back maybe evident.


","

1) Encourage rapid emergence by managing planting depth (shallow), timing, and soil moisture. Work soil at moisture conditions that reduce soil compaction.

2) Avoid planting in wet or poorly-drained soil.

3) Rotate clover crops with grass and grain.

4) Use good quality seed.

5) Lime acid soils to get a pH of 6.5 or 7.0.

Coleus ,(Plectranthus scutellarioides)-Damping-off,"Both Pythium spp and Rhizoctonia solani can cause pre- and post-emergence damping-off. Pythium is favored by cool and overly moist soil conditions.
Rhizoctonia survives in the soil as sclerotia or as mycelium colonizing bits of organic matter. Roots become infected as they grow past these structures. The fungus then grows along the root surface, forms an aggregation called an infection cushion, pushes into the root where it colonies, spreads and kills the tissue. The fungus can form knots of mycelium that develop into sclerotia. These are released into the soil as the plant debris decomposes.


","Stems of seedlings or recent transplants collapse at the soil line and die. Cuttings may also rot. Rhizoctonia causes stems to become blackened and water-soaked.


","

1) Plant in pasteurized, well-drained raised beds at the proper depth.

2) Rotate to different beds from year to year.

3) Avoid reusing pots or trays from a previous crop for propagation. If pots must be reused then wash off all debris and soak in a sanitizing solution or treat with aerated steam for 30 min.

4) Let the soil dry down without drying out. Do not overwater.

5) Media pH should be around 5.6 to 6.4 and note that coleus tend to naturally lower the growing media pH.

6) Seeds should be planted when temperatures favor rapid germination and growth, so plants rapidly emerge and reach a more mature or hardened state. Use bottom heat when starting cuttings.

7) Use as little misting as possible after sticking. Mist should not wet the media until roots are formed. Water cuttings after sticking and once on the bench. Maintain moderate media moisture while cuttings are forming callus. Start drying the media once callus has formed and reduce mist. Media should be light brown in color but not dry. Once roots form, dry media a little more but just enough to prevent wilting. Uniform moisture from top to bottom of media is important.

The disease was found in Oregon in 2007 and 2008, generally in April. It affects newly expanding young leaves. Infection and sporulation occur readily from 59°F to 68°F but are reduced above 77°F. Extended periods of high relative humidity favor disease development. More sporangia can be found in the greenhouse air when long periods of high humidity are followed by low humidity midday. Infections will become inactive or latent once temperatures rise above 77°F and plants may appear healthy. Once conditions become cool and moist the pathogen can resume growth inside the plant.
The cultivars Florida Rustic Orange, Aurora Peach, Aurora Mocha, Fairway Mosaic, Florida Sun Jade, and New Orleans Red were susceptible while the cultivars Florida Sun Rose and Lava were resistant. Additional highly-resistant cultivars include Dark Star, Twist of Lime, Henna, Bone Fish, Under the Sea Electric Coral, Under the Sea Lime Shrimp, Burgundy Lace, Cranberry Bog, and The Whirlpool.


","Infected foliage is chlorotic, distorted (inward curling and twisting of leaves), and stunted, usually turning brown and necrotic. Foliage infection results in defoliation and death of young seedlings. The undersides of leaves may develop an extensive violet-brown growth under high humidity prior to any signs of necrosis. On larger plants the lower older leaves fall off first leaving a tuft of newer leaves near the top of shoots.

Rhizoctonia solani occurs in Oregon on other crops and may incite root rot on other crops including arugula, beets, snap bean, clover, peppermint, and Brassicas. This fungus also causes damping-off of a wide range of plant species. It overwinters in soil or plant debris and can survive many years as sclerotia or chlamydospores.

Coriander and Cilantro ,(Coriandrum sativum)-Septoria Leaf Spot,"A fungus, Septoria petroselini, which can be seedborne affects both cilantro and parsley. Infected seed can have reduced germination and emergence. Once this fungus is introduced to a field, it survives on non-decomposed plant debris and produces conidia under a wide temperature range (50°F to 86°F). Spread occurs under moist conditions (wind-driven rain, dew drips, irrigation) and by mechanical means (tools or workers). The pathogen may overwinter as diseased plants, which survive mild winters.

Corn ,(Zea mays)-Bacterial Stalk Rot,"Erwinia chrysanthemi pv. zeae (syn. = Dickeya zeae = E. carotovora f. sp. zeae), a bacterium that persists on crop residues in soil. Stalk rot is observed sporadically in the Pacific Northwest; a top rot is observed in fields with overhead irrigation using contaminated river, lake, or ditch water. Warm (86ºF to 95ºF) temperatures and high relative humidity promote the development of bacterial stalk rot. Moisture collected in the whorl of overhead irrigation equipment, especially if nitrogen is applied by overhead irrigation, or from heavy dew formation is believed to be the contributing factor for top rot. Top rot has been severe in some fields in Oregon and Washington. Observations in Washington and Oregon indicate the disease frequently is severe in plants when growing on sulfur-deficient soils. The variety 'Jubilee' is very susceptible.


","Stalk rot symptoms usually appear in midseason. The first and/or second internode above the soil line appears water soaked, turns tan to brown, and becomes soft and mushy. Affected plants suddenly collapse and fall over with their vascular strands still intact. Infected tissue has a foul odor.

",
Corn ,(Zea mays)-Common Smut,"The fungus, Ustilago zeae (syn. = U. maydis), overwinters in soil as teliospores. Spores may survive 2 or 3 years. When cattle feed on corn stalks, spores are carried through into the manure. Spores may be wind-blown long distances. In the Pacific Northwest, the fungus attacks only corn. Younger plants are more susceptible. After ears form, plants are resistant. Any aboveground plant part may become infected. Infection increases with injury from hail, detasseling, earworms, or insect borers. Smut usually is more severe on plants heavily fertilized with nitrogen.
In a warm growing season, the amount of smut coincides closely with soil moisture, especially in June. If temperatures are lower than average, there may be little smut even though soil moisture is high. Below 61°F there is little spore germination. Optimum for spore germination is 79°F to 100°F. Higher temperatures and/or higher spore numbers likely contribute to generally increased levels of infection in corn fields planted later in the season (June) compared to those planted prior to May 15th in the Columbia Basin. Moist soil that has been manured generally favors smut infection. 'Golden Jubilee' and 'Super Sweet Jubilee' are very susceptible.


","Young, and/or actively growing parts of the plant are susceptible to infection. Infected tissues are transformed into galls by the fungus, sometimes 4 to 5 inches in diameter, containing a mass of black, greasy, or powdery spores. Spores are covered with a greenish white to silvery white membrane. The covering becomes dry and brittle, breaks open, and permits the black powdery contents to spill out. These spores can fall to the ground or become windborne. There is no stringy mass of vascular tissue as in head smut.


","Controls generally have been unsatisfactory.

1) Planting tolerant cultivars is the best control. Cultivars that show improved resistance over two years of testing in the Columbia Basin include: Elite, Chase, Conquest, Eliminator, Diva, and Marvel.

2) Avoid mechanical injury to plants during cultivation and spraying.

3) Provide a well-balanced soil fertility.

4) Cut and ensile green corn before spores mature. In home gardens, remove and throw away or burn galls before they rupture.

5) Plant before May 15th.

","Seed treatment is of no value because spores are not transmitted with the corn seed. Topical applications of fungicides may prove to be effective but none are recommended at this time.


",
Corn ,(Zea mays)-Crown and Stalk Node Rot,"Fusarium spp. are known to cause a crown rot of corn, both on field and sweet corn. Crown rot has been observed on sweet corn in the Willamette Valley. These fungal pathogens are able to colonize other plant species, especially grassy plant species. These soilborne fungi can also survive in affected plant residues, on other infected hosts, as well as in soil. Sometimes pathogen populations reach high levels in fields when corn is planted after grass seed. Dry, hot conditions favor the development of crown and stalk node rot while wet, compacted soils promote Fusarium root rot. Excess nitrogen or imbalanced applications can favor development of crown rot; heavy manure applications have been associated with crown rot of field corn.


","In affected fields, crown rot may be present as early as the 6-leaf stage, and commonly by silking. Affected plants usually show leaf firing, starting from the base of the plant and progressing upwards. After pollination, plants may wilt during high temperatures and leaves may exhibit a subtle-to-obvious change in green hue. Crown rot is characterized by dark-brown or black-colored rot of inner tissues in the crown. By harvest and often much earlier, stalk nodes appear reddish-brown to dark black in color and can range from a small portion of the node affected to a strip of rot almost ¼ inch wide throughout the node plate. Stalk nodes typically rot progressively up the stalk; however, nodes that bear ears may be darker than nodes immediately below. Internodes can sometimes show discoloration of a few vascular elements but internodes are not typically symptomatic and do not rot.
Little rot of roots is observed at the 4- to 6-leaf stage. Often rot spreads from the crown into brace roots and side tillers, resulting in a mass of rot below soil that can be mistaken for root rot. The severity of disease in affected fields depends on cultivar susceptibility, pathogen population levels, and environmental conditions.


","

1) Frequent cropping with corn will lead to a buildup in pathogen population levels. Avoid planting sweet corn after grass seed in problem fields.

2) 'Jubilee' and related cultivars are very susceptible to this disease so the use of other cultivars will aid prevention for fields where the pathogen propagules are present.

3) Apply balanced nitrogen applications and avoid an excess of N.

4) Irrigate more frequently for shorter periods so as to avoid drought stress as well as overly wet soils.

5) Residue levels may enhance the population of pathogen so maximizing residue breakdown could be important in problem fields.

","Seed treatment with various fungicides can aid in controlling rot of the mesocotyl but isn't thought to offer protection against crown rot later in the season.

Corn ,(Zea mays)-Damping-off,,,,,
Corn ,(Zea mays)-Ear Rots,"Many fungi are associated with various ear rots and kernel rots of corn. In sweet corn, principal pathogens include Fusarium verticillioides, Penicillium oxalicum, Rhizopus stolonifer, Aspergillus spp., and Nigrospora oryzae. These fungi survive on plant debris in or on soil and may be found on seed. Ear rots are more severe following injuries, such as those from corn earworm, western bean cutworm, or heavy thrips infestation.


","Fusarium ear rot starts with a salmon-pink to reddish-brown discoloration of individual kernels or groups of kernels scattered over the ear. A powdery or cottony, pink, moldy growth develops later on infected kernels. Kernels develop whitish streaks on the pericarp if infected late in the season. Penicillium-infected kernels show green or bluish-green powdery, moldy growth. Rhizopus-infected ears show rough, whitish growth with black specks. Aspergillus ear rot appears as a black, greenish-yellow, or tan growth on infected areas of the ear. Nigrospora ear rot is not conspicuous until harvest when a shredding of the cob is noticeable. Kernels may have a grayish growth with black specks.

Corn ,(Zea mays)-Head Smut,"Sphacelotheca reiliana (Sorosporium reilianum, syn. = Ustilago reiliana), a fungus that survives as spores in soil, remaining viable at least 5 to 7 years. Spores may be wind-blown long distances. In the Willamette Valley of Oregon, corn pickers are the most likely method of spread. In the Pacific Northwest, the fungus has been observed only on corn. However, there are two strains of the fungus. One fungus attacks only corn, the other only sorghum and sudangrass. Infection reportedly occurs in the seedling stage; however, greenhouse studies demonstrate infection can occur several weeks after the corn has been planted. After infection, the fungus develops systemically. Infection may occur at soil temperatures as low as 59°F but occurs more readily at 68°F to 86°F. The fungus is not internally seedborne but can be carried on the seed surface.


","Sporulating fungal sites occur in the tassel, ear, or occasionally leaf. The gall is coarse and on eruption reveals dry spore masses with strands of vascular tissue. Dwarfing may be a dominant symptom in some cultivars. Ears may be aborted or mere rudiments with leaf buds instead of the normal ear. Usually, smut spores replace the entire ear, but occasionally some ears bear a few kernels. Tassels may be infected completely or partially. Infection may be confined to individual spikelets, or it may proliferate and cause bizarre leafy structures. Smut may infect both the ear and tassel in some plants; if only the ear is infected, tassels are sterile.


","

1) Rotate out of corn for 3 to 4 years if fields are only lightly infested.

2) Several corn cultivars-Style-pak, Commander, Rapidpak, and Reliance-have shown resistance and are useful for commercial plantings. Two other corn cultivars, Goldie and Blitz, are resistant but useful only in home gardens because of other characteristics.

In the Western States, it first was confirmed in Idaho in 1993, in Utah in 1994, and in Washington in 1998. Both dent and sweet corn cultivars are affected. This virus is transmitted by the wheat curl mite (Aceria tosichella), the same vector that transmits Wheat Streak Mosaic and Wheat Spot Mosaic. Wheat, barley, yellow and green foxtail, rye, and witch grass may be sources of the virus.


","Infected plants are stunted and yellowish. Mosaic symptoms usually are evident in the whorl and on older leaves. One or more yellowish or reddish-purple bands about 0.25 to 0.5 inch wide running parallel to the veins frequently are observed on midsize to fully developed leaves.

Usually these diseases have not had great economic significance in the Pacific Northwest. The fungi overwinter on infected plant debris, and winds can move spores long distances. Moderate temperatures and high humidity favor the disease. Other grass species are affected.


","In each of these diseases, the symptoms are long circular to elliptical, grayish green or tan lesions. In moist weather, concentric dark rings may be observed in the lesions. Lower leaves are affected first, and the disease moves up the plant. The plant's premature death resembles frost or drought injury.

Corn ,(Zea mays)-Maize Dwarf Mosaic,"Maize dwarf mosaic virus (MDMV) was first found in Ohio in 1962 and was not known to be in the Pacific Northwest until 1977, when losses in sweet corn occurred in the Twin Falls area. Severe losses have occurred most years since 1962 in most major corn-producing states east of the Rocky Mountains and in California. MDMV is transmitted by aphids and can infect sorghum, Johnsongrass, yellow foxtail, crabgrass, and other wild grasses. There are several virus strains, which differ in their host range.


","Initial symptoms are small yellowish spots and streaks generally concentrated in the lower third of newly forming leaves in the plant's whorl. These may coalesce to form light green or yellow mosaic patterns. Mosaic symptoms may increase in extent and intensity over time but frequently decrease in intensity later in the season, making identification based on leaf symptoms difficult. If infection is early, plants may be stunted, only a third to half as tall as healthy plants. Infected plants may be barren or, if they form ears, seed fill may be spotty and incomplete.


","

1) Field corn is more resistant than sweet corn. Sweet corn cultivars vary in tolerance, and some are tolerant at some locations but not at others. More information is needed on the interaction between virus strain and variety before varietal recommendations can be made.

2) Early-seeded sweet corn may escape aphid flights.

","Root rot may develop as early as the 6-leaf stage on the primary or seminal roots and is noted by the present of rot or brownish lesions on the roots. Root rot may continue to develop and can be severe on the adventitious root portion, including rooted brace roots. Severe root rot may be apparent early season, at silking, or later.

Corn ,(Zea mays)-Stalk Rots,"Several fungi can cause stalk rots. The principal ones are Fusarium verticillioides and Pythium spp. They can overwinter on corn crop residue or in soil, and Fusarium propagules may be carried on seed. Incidence of the root and stalk rot phase is associated with moisture stress and over fertilization with nitrogen. Stalks or roots previously injured by cold or insects are especially susceptible to attack by these fungi.


","Brown decayed spots appear on roots, and the disease moves into the crown. Root rot is usually, but not always, accompanied by stalk rot. Root and stalk rot causes premature dying, and rotted stalks break over as the crop matures. Fusarium stalk rot develops a whitish pink to salmon discoloration of the pith. A characteristic of Pythium stalk rot is that the internode just above the soil line becomes brown, water-soaked, and soft and collapses.


","

1) Use -free seed

2) Crop rotation and burying residues reduce the amount of disease.

3) Do not overfertilize with nitrogen.

4) Avoid root pruning when close-cultivating and injecting fertilizer.

5) Use resistant varieties such as 'Champ' or 'Dugan'. Other resistant varieties may be available from your seed distributor.

Corn ,(Zea mays)-Stewart's Disease (Stewart's Bacterial Wilt),"This disease is observed only rarely and is not considered a significant problem for Pacific Northwest corn plantings. It is caused by Pantoea stewartii subsp. stewartii (syn. = Erwinia stewartii), a bacterium vectored by several insects including the 12-spotted cucumber beetle and seed corn maggots. However, the corn flea beetle is the most important insect for overwintering and spreading the bacterium. Warm winters favor survival of the beetle vectors and increase the risk of Stewart's disease. Nutrition influences disease severity: high ammonium, nitrogen, and phosphorus levels tend to increase susceptibility; high calcium and potassium levels tend to decrease susceptibility. High temperatures also enhance disease development.


","Initially, leaf lesions originate from flea beetles' feeding scars. Leaves show linear, pale green to yellow streaks with irregular or wavy margins parallel to the veins. Entire leaves may be blighted as lesions coalesce. Infected plants wilt rapidly and may die.


","

1) Use resistant hybrids.

2) Control insect vectors. See the     for details.

Cosmos,Powdery Mildew,"Golovinomyces cichoracearum (formerly Erysiphe cichoracearum) has not been reported formally for the Pacific Northwest, but it is a common garden problem on cosmos. This fungus is favored by conditions that produce high humidity but dry leaves. It is a highly specialized pathogen that forms a close association with the host. Conditions that favor the host also favor the pathogen. Much of the fungus remains outside infected plant parts where it grows on the surface but sinks root-like structures called haustoria into plant cells to obtain nutrients. The white growth seen is composed of both mycelium and fungal spores.


","Grayish-white, powdery spots develop on leaves. Some yellowing and premature defoliation may be observed.

Crabapple ,(Malus spp.)-Powdery Mildew,"Podosphaera leucotricha, a fungus that overwinters in terminal buds. Infected buds that survive the winter open later than healthy buds and are already covered with many conidia. Young growth is infected and supports new colonies, which continue the cycle many times during the growing season. New terminal growth is particularly susceptible. Other host plants include pear, fruiting apples, and quince. Can be a problem in nursery production when the leader is infected and stunted rather than producing more desirable rapid, long growth.


","The disease occurs on foliage, twigs, blossoms, and fruit. On the leaves, small gray or white felt-like patches of fungus develop, frequently on the undersides. Young infected leaves increase in length but not in width, and become curled and distorted. The fungus often covers entire terminals with its masses of white mycelium and powdery spores. Infected foliage is brittle and may be killed or cease to function normally, thus devitalizing the tree. Diseased blossoms are brownish, shriveled and soon die.

The cedar-apple rust (G. juniperi-virginianae) common in the Eastern States has not been reported from the Pacific Northwest. Other, rosaceous hosts may be infected besides crabapple, including pear, hawthorn, mountain ash, and serviceberry.
Spores (teliospores) produced on incense-cedar or juniper infect crabapples from April to June. Aeciospores produced on the crabapples can infect the alternate host from June to August during favorable weather. Telia are not produced until the following year but can continue production for the next 3 years.
Spores (teliospores) produced on Alaska yellow-cedar infect crabapples from mid-May to June. Aeciospores produced on the crabapples can infect the alternate host from June to late September during favorable weather. Uredinia may be produced the following year to reinfect other Alaska yellow-cedar from June to October. Telia are not produced until the second year after initial infection.

Crabapple ,(Malus spp.)-Scab,"Venturia inaequalis, the fungus that causes scab on commercial cultivars of apple. This is the most serious disease of crabapple and can almost completely defoliate susceptible trees. Wet, cool spring weather favors the disease, which affects leaves and fruit. Trees that lose many leaves due to scab may become weak and more susceptible to other pests and environmental problems.
The fungus overwinters in diseased leaf debris on the ground. Ascospores on leaves are produced in wet spring weather. Wind carries spores to young leaves and flowers where they initiate primary infections. Infections eventually produce millions of conidia, which splashing rain and wind spread to new leaf or fruit surfaces in the tree. Spores germinate to cause new lesions. Several secondary cycles of conidial germination, infection, and sporulation may occur during a growing season.


","The first visible leaf symptoms in spring are pale, chlorotic, water-soaked spots the size of a pinhead. These enlarge, becoming darker and smoky in appearance, later taking on an olive shade and ultimately a brownish black color. Spots may be any shape but frequently are circular. Young infections often show a radiating spread of fungus tissue through the leaf; such areas later appear as irregular, brown infections. Diseased leaves can be curled and distorted and often drop early, thus defoliating and weakening the tree.


","

1) New plantings:

1.1) If possible, plant disease-resistant trees (see Crabapple Cultivar Susceptibility). The following types did not develop scab over a 33 year evaluation period at Wooster, Ohio: M. sargentii 'Sargent', M. baccata 'Jackii', M. x 'Beverly', M. x 'Silver Moon', and M. x 'White Angel'. 
1.2) Plant trees in full sun and/or avoid too much shade.
2) Existing plantings:

2.1) Avoid wetting the leaves when irrigating.
2.2) When possible, rake and destroy fallen leaves before they become dry and brittle.
","Do not apply if fruit is to be consumed. Apply fungicides early and thoroughly to protect new growth. The first susceptible tissues exposed in opening cluster buds are the tips of the leaves and sepals. The most critical period for scab development is from the breaking of the cluster buds until leaves are fully expanded. Use only one fungicide from any single fungicide group once a year. Always tank-mix and/or alternate products to prevent buildup of resistant pathogens.
An interesting study from Indiana found apple orchard isolates of this fungus resistant to Group 1 fungicides (such as the thiophanate-methyl-based products below) but not isolates from ornamental crabapples.

Crabapple ,(Malus spp.)-Stem Rot,"Phytophthora syringae, a soilborne fungus-like microorganism. It grows and is active at lower temperatures than the Phytophthora species that cause crown and collar rot of apple. This pathogen survives in soil and in fallen leaves. P. syringae occurs as a winter disease of nursery stock, especially on trees that have been harvested and are stored in either coolers or heeled-in outdoor sawdust beds. The fungus can invade wounds caused by handling or pruning or through leaves and leaf scars. It can spread rapidly during cold, rainy periods. It produces zoospores that move passively with rain splash, surface water, and in water in soils near saturation. The disease also occurs frequently on flowering pear, Asian pear and white ash. It has also been found on chestnut, Chionanthus, Forsythia, flowering Prunus, Hawthorn, Jasminum, lilac, Mt. Ash and Zelkova.


","Cankers may occur anywhere on the stem of young plants but primarily on the lower stems and the base of tree trunks. Infection of apple bark tissues causes them to become necrotic, turn brown and give off an alcoholic odor. The leading edge of an active lesion may be irregularly mottled, merging imperceptibly into healthy tissue. In young nursery stock, cankers may appear slightly sunken and darker than normal. The color of the canker ranges from black to brown depending on tree taxa. May be difficult to find when dry. Wetting cankers can make them more noticeable. Cankers may girdle the tree producing a general lack of vigor, which may result in smaller leaves, reduced shoot growth, sparse, chlorotic foliage and premature autumn color.


","

1) Prevent mechanical injury to trees, especially late in the season.

2) Avoid leaving trees on the ground during rainy winter weather.

3) Plant on well-drained sites.

4) Avoid mounding soil around the trunks. Also, do not ""heel-in"" higher than the collar.

5) Harvest highly susceptible nursery trees during dry weather.

6) Remove and destroy all infected plants and plant debris.

","To minimize the development of resistant fungi, alternate or tank-mix fungicides from different groups that have different modes of action.

Crabapple ,(Malus spp.)-Twig Dieback and Canker,"Phacidiopycnis washingtonensis and Sphaeropsis pyriputrescens have become a problem in apple orchards with 'Manchurian' crabapple pollinizers that are very susceptible to these fungi and are a significant source of inoculum for apple storage rots. The disease in apples is called Speck rot and Sphaeropsis rot, respectively. Fruiting bodies on twigs and fruit contain millions of spores, which serve as inoculum for fruit or twig infection. These fungal spores are then spread by rain, irrigation water, or over-tree cooling.


","Twigs become discolored, dry, and dieback. Small branches may become girdled and turn light-brown distal to the leading edge of the canker. The cankers may transition from a light-brown dieback into a dark-brown area before transitioning into health wood. The dead, papery, light-brown epidermis may be seen flaking off these dead twigs. Larger limbs may also die. Many black dots (fruiting bodies) may be seen in the cankered tissue. Crabapple fruit may also be infected becoming dark, mummified, and developing many fruiting bodies.


","

1) Remove and destroy cankers, dead twigs, and mummified fruit.

2) Avoid overhead irrigation.

3) Limit over-tree cooling to keep trees wet for shorter periods of time.

Cranberry ,(Vaccinium macrocarpon)-Botryosphaeria Fruit Rot and Berry Speckle,"Phyllosticta vaccinii (sexual Botryosphaeria vaccinii) (formerly Guignardia vaccinii), a fungus. The disease is found most often in beds or portions of beds that have soil or crop management problems. The asexual stage is found in the Pacific Northwest and causes a minor fruit rot known as berry speckle. The fungus overwinters in plant debris in and around planting beds. Cool moist weather encourages disease development. Spores are expelled in a gelatinous mass that is soluble in water. This stage is produced during the growing season and is  probably spread by water.


","Runners and uprights defoliate after leaves redden prematurely. Fruiting structures generally do not form until after the leaf or fruit have fallen from the plant. Black, circular, pinpoint-size, subepidermal fruiting structures usually are on one side of the midrib of the lower leaf surface. Fruit develop small light colored lesions about 1 to 2 mm in diameter on the epidermis. Lesions remain light in color while the fruit ripens and turns red around them. Faint red ring spots may also appear on the fruit.

Cranberry ,(Vaccinium macrocarpon)-Cottonball,"Monilinia oxycocci, a fungus that overwinters in mummified berries from the previous season. Apothecia (spore cups) arise from these berries in the spring. Spores (ascospores) released from the cups infect new shoot growth in early spring, causing tip blight. Blighted shoot tips appear in June. Fruit infections are from a second, asexual spore type (conidia) produced on blighted shoot tips. This disease was a problem in Washington during the 1920s and 1930s but is rarely found now, except in British Columbia where it is still considered an economic problem.


","In the tip-blight stage of disease, young growing tips of new upright growth turn brown, curl over and wilt. Masses of whitish gray spores (conidia) form on a portion of the stem of the blighted upright. Affected berries remain yellowish-tan rather than coloring normally. In some cases infected berries turn brown and shrivel before sizing up. Diseased berries also remain firm instead of becoming soft, as is the case with other fruit-rotting fungi. Diseased berry seed cavities contain a white, cottony fungus growth. Late in the season, fruits shrivel, harden and darken, and eventually mummify.

Cranberry ,(Vaccinium macrocarpon)-Early Leaf Spot,"A fungus, Protoventuria myrtilli, common in the cranberry production areas of Oregon and Washington. Whether it affects plant vigor or yield is unknown. It overwinters in the previous season's leaves and in dead leaves in the duff layer.


","Infected second-year leaves develop distinct reddened circles or rings on the upper surface early in spring. Close examination reveals dark, radiating, subcuticular hyphae. The reddening may disappear by summer, but then rings appear darkened due to the hyphae's presence. Small, dark, fruiting structures, pseudothecia, are produced on the outside of spots after the leaf tissue becomes senescent.

Cranberry ,(Vaccinium macrocarpon)-False Blossom,"A phytoplasma that is transmitted only by the blunt-nosed leafhopper. This disease was first detected in Wisconsin in the 1920's and susequently brought into New Jersey and Massachusetts. The disease was noted in the 2001 edition of ""Cranberry Production PNW 274"" with symtoms observed in both Oregon and Washington. The disease is not spreading actively and is of only minor importance because the insect vector is not found in Western North America. However, after decades of its absence in commercial beds in New Jersey and Massachusetts, it has been found in several beds in the mid 2010's. If vines are secured from either of those two states, they should be inspected for the disease and the vector before being imported into the PNW.


","The lobes of the calyx become enlarged at bloom, and petals are short and streaked with deep pink, red, or green. Flowers usually are sterile (do not produce berries). Branching is stimulated, resulting in a witches' broom. Foliage on infected plants might redden prematurely and fall. Diseased vines grow few if any runners and tend to die out over time. The symptoms of the disease are often confused with other blossom problems.

Cranberry ,(Vaccinium macrocarpon)-Fruit Rots,"Several fungi including Godronia cassandrae (asexual: Fusicoccum putrefaciens), end rot; Phomopsis vaccinii, viscid rot; Botrytis sp., yellow rot; Allantophomopsis cytisporea and A. lycopodina, black rot; Gomerella cingulata (asexual Colletotrichum acutatum), bitter rot; Coleophoma empetri, ripe rot; Botryosphaeria vaccinii, berry speckle; and Physalospora vaccinii, blotch rot.  Two yeasts have also been shown to rot cranberry including Hanseniaspora uvarum and Candida railenensis.  Fungi that cause fruit rots are in the beds and can be troublesome especially when rainy conditions persist during bloom. The two types of rot are field rots that develop before harvest, and postharvest rots that form after harvest in fresh fruit in refrigerated storage. Field rots have not been economically important in well-managed beds but levels are on the increase. Postharvest rots are important only for fresh fruit; frozen storage has eliminated them for fruit to be processed. Control of fruit rots in the field near fruit set reduces decay when fresh berries are held in refrigerated storage. Bacteria have not been shown to cause fruit rots.


","Any change in normal color or consistency of the berry during development such as softening, discoloring, or shriveling. Symptoms on fruit infected by different fungi are very similar, making it nearly impossible to distinguish between rots based on symptoms alone.
Low temperature breakdown, from berries stored at freezing for over 2 weeks, is characterized by a dull external appearance and watersoaked or rubbery deep maroon flesh.

Cranberry ,(Vaccinium macrocarpon)-Nematodes,"Three genera, the ring nematode, (Mesocriconema spp.), the stubby root nematode (Paratrichodorus spp.), and the sheath nematode (Hemicycliophora spp.) are the most common in the Pacific Northwest. A survey in the mid-1990s of 53 Oregon and Washington cranberry beds showed the incidence and population densities of these nematodes were slightly higher in weak areas of beds but not significantly greater than in strong areas. It has been suggested that nematode parasitism may increase the severity of root-rot diseases caused by soilborne pathogen fungi, but this has not been demonstrated experimentally. No nematode-resistant cranberry cultivars are known.


","These three nematodes have been reported in greenhouse studies to reduce runner growth and to cause darkened, stunted, or galled roots. It is unclear what role they play in cranberry plant health under field conditions.


","Most data suggest that nematode control is not warranted in mature beds. However, the establishment of new plantings may be reduced on nematode-infested sites.

1) Vine cuttings from beds with a history of nematodes should not be used to establish new plantings.

","Soil fumigation is recommended before replanting on land with a history of nematode problems.


","


1) MeloCon WG (  strain 251) at 2 to 4 lb/A plus a soil wetting agent can be applied to established plants, although it might be better used when applied to plants just before planting. Stable for only days at room temperature, weeks in the refrigerator or for a year if frozen. Unknown efficacy in the PNW. 4-hr reentry.

"
Cranberry ,(Vaccinium macrocarpon)-Phytophthora Root and Runner Rot,"Although three Phytophthora spp. have been found in Oregon and Washington beds P. cinnamomi is the most pathogenic. These fungus-like microorganisms have spores that swim to healthy plants, enter them, and destroy roots and runners under flooded conditions. Most beds with root rot were wet picked; root rot in dry-picked beds occurs in areas with poor drainage.


","Dead spots in the bed occur first in poorly drained areas. Dead spots continue to expand to healthy areas. Plants at the margin may be stunted, usually have reddened foliage, and exhibit unthrifty growth. Lower (underground) runners have a red to olive-brown discoloration and lack feeder roots. Newly planted vines also die.


","Focus on these methods first.

1) Improve drainage in low areas of the bed.

2) Sand-in and replant poorly growing and low areas.

3) Uniform application of sprinkler irrigation will help avoid excessive water.

4) Maintain ditches and drains around the beds.

5) Construct new beds so that the crown is high enough to drain adequately into surrounding ditches or install internal drains.

","Use if needed but rotate materials from different groups to prevent or delay the occurrence of resistant fungi. Resistance to Group 4 fungicides has been detected in New Jersey.

Cranberry ,(Vaccinium macrocarpon)-Pyrenobotrys Leaf Spot,"The fungus Pyrenobotrys compacta produces a conspicuous disease, but it appears to cause little damage. Spores in the fruiting bodies (pseudothecia) mature in early summer and infect new leaves in summer or early fall.


","Clusters or rings of discrete black fruiting bodies appear on the lower leaf surface in late winter or early spring. Purplish red lesions with diffuse margins are seen on the upper leaf surface above the fruiting bodies. Leaf lesions turn brown, and a few leaves yellow and fall from the upright by early summer. Symptoms are only on the previous season's growth.

Cranberry ,(Vaccinium macrocarpon)-Red Leaf Spot,"Exobasidium rostrupii, a fungus. Disease may be severe on newly planted vines treated with high-nitrogen fertilizers for rapid growth during the first and/or second year. Shaded areas with poor air circulation may contribute to disease development. Fruit buds and blossoms injured by frost or insects are very susceptible. Symptoms may appear during rainy (misty), cloudy weather beginning in midsummer on new growth.


","One or several glossy red spots appear on the upper leaf surface. Spots may coalesce to form large blotches. The lower leaf surface is covered with cream-color spores beneath the spots. The petiole and stem may become infected, enlarge, and turn red. If severe, terminal growth of the uprights and runners dies, and the next crop is reduced. Fruit is attacked occasionally. Reddened tissues often turn black as they are invaded by the black spot fungus, Ramularia nigromaculans (formerly Mycosphaerella nigromaculans). In combination, the two diseases occasionally do serious damage but only when the incidence of red leaf spot has been high.


","

1) Use a controlled nitrogen fertilizer program.

2) Remove trees around the bed to decrease shade and improve air circulation.

3) Protect from frost and insect damage.

Cranberry ,(Vaccinium macrocarpon)-Rose Bloom,"Exobasidium vaccinii (formerly Exobasidium oxycocci), a fungus.The disease occurs occasionally in some Pacific Northwest beds. It has a 1-year life cycle-infections in spring do not develop symptoms until the next spring. Basidiospores produced on thickened lateral shoots infect nearby lateral buds on new shoot growth. Spores are forcibly discharged, and wind carries them around the bed. Yield on infected fruiting uprights is reduced by a third; that is, yield falls 5% in a bed with 15% infected uprights.


","The fungus normally attacks only the axillary buds, causing them to produce abnormal branches with thickened, hypertrophied, rose-colored leaves that resemble miniature roses-hence the name. The fungus occasionally attacks terminal buds and blossoms. Infected blossoms are deformed and usually enlarged. Affected berries are deformed.

Cranberry ,(Vaccinium macrocarpon)-Twig Blight,"Lophodermium oxycocci (the more common species) and L. hypophyllum, fungi. They overwinter as mycelium in last season's leaves. The spores are ejected forcibly into the air, where wind disperses them. New growth is infected between late June and mid-August, but exactly when varies from year to year. Twig blight may be severe the year after planting. Check vines in the second year and protect new growth if needed. This disease can slow the establishment of new beds. Yield on infected uprights is lowered by one-third, and the following year's crop is also impacted as infected uprights are less likely to set a mixed bud for the next crop year.


","Infected leaves turn from dark brown to bleached tan in late winter and spring and remain attached to the dead uprights. Blighted uprights may be scattered, or they can be in areas ranging from a few feet in diameter to the entire bed. Black, glossy, fruiting bodies (apothecia) begin to form on the lower surfaces of infected leaves in spring. As apothecia mature, they become football-shaped and open along a median slit to release spores.

Cranberry ,(Vaccinium macrocarpon)-Upright Dieback,"This fungal disease, caused by Diaporthe vaccinii (formerly Phomopsis vaccinii), occasionally is in Pacific Northwest beds. This same fungus produces a disease of the fruit called viscid rot. Godronia cassandrae (asexual: Fusicoccum putrefaciens) has also been shown to be a causal agent, but at significantly less incidence than Diaporthe. Practices that encourage overly vigorous growth favor the disease. Current-year, spring growth is the most susceptible growth stage, although plants can be infected throughout the season if wounded. One study showed that stem-pierce wounds resulted in infection of more plants and typically greater tissue death than other wound techniques. Isolates from blueberry can also infect cranberry. Most cranberry cultivars appear to be susceptible to the disease.


","Leaves take on a yellowish cast early in spring and later become orange or bronze. Leaves often exhibit a yellow mottling before they turn completely yellow. Infected uprights generally die before bloom. Diseased and healthy uprights may be on the same runner. Vegetative and fruiting uprights are both affected. Roots are not affected. The disease may be in clusters or, more usually, scattered through the bed. As many as 25% of the uprights may be affected in certain beds.

Cranberry ,(Vaccinium macrocarpon)-Viruses,"Several virus diseases have been reported on cranberry. A strain of the Blueberry red ringspot virus, a caulimovirus, has been associated with symptoms of cranberry ringspot. Although Tobacco streak virus (TSV) has been reported to occur in symptomless cultivars, fruit scarring and reduced berry weight and fruit set have been associated with this virus in cranberry. Plants, however, recover from these symptoms the following year. Uprights infected with Blueberry shock virus also produced scarred, disfigured berries that turn red prematurely. Plants have also been shown to recover from Blueberry shock virus symptoms. The carlavirus Blueberry scorch virus (BlScV) has been described from symptomless cranberry plants.


","
BuRRV - Light greenish-yellow rings appear on red fruit.
TSV - Scars appear on berries as necrotic, irregularly shaped, and indented lesions ranging up to half an inch long. Affected berries turn red prematurely. Some berries abort while others matured but were distorted with lesions causing deep indentations and/or cracks. Other parts of the plant seem normal. Plants do not show symptoms the following year.


","

1) For all viruses, use virus-tested (and found to be free of all known viruses) certified stock.

2) Let    run its course. Plants that have recovered appear to produce a full crop, but these plants can continue to serve as an inoculum source for nearby plants and for any new plantings.

Erysiphe overwinters in dormant buds. These buds are covered with conidia in the spring, which start the season's epidemic. Warm days and cool nights along with extended periods of dry weather favor development and spread of the disease. Young and succulent tissues are more susceptible than older hardened tissue.


","The disease occurs on young shoots in the spring. Small, circular white patches are on young leaves. These leaves may become stunted, attain only a third their normal size, and become abnormally thickened. Affected plant parts become covered with a white, mealy to dusty growth. Internodes are short, flower stems are stunted, and buds often fail to develop flowers. Infected portions often have a reddish discoloration under the white coating. Defoliation may also occur.

Crocosmia,Corm Rot,,,,,
Cucumber ,(Cucumis sativa)-Black Root Rot,,"Cucumber plants start to wilt late in the season, usually after fruit have formed. Wilting develops very rapidly over the whole plant, usually without initial yellowing (chlorosis) or necrosis of the leaves. Symptoms on roots include salmon-colored to gray or brown lesions, sometimes with dark-black lines (pseudostromata) that demarcate infected areas of roots. The crown and tap root of infected plants become dry and corky and, when severe enough, plants start to wilt very rapidly. Root symptoms, including the dark lines and pseudosclerotia, may only be observed after the onset of severe wilting. Distinct, rectangular, black pseudosclerotia can be observed in individual cells of the cortex, creating a checkerboard appearance. The fungus occasionally forms black pycnidia in infected roots and crowns.

Often, dead tissue is torn away from the healthy portion, leaving large, irregular holes. Water-soaked spots on fruit are smaller than on leaves, and they are circular. Lesions usually are superficial, but the injury may permit entry of soft-rot organisms. Affected tissue becomes white and may crack open.


","The following control program is a combination of those used in other areas.

1) Use clean, bacteria-free seed.

2) Practice a 2-year rotation out of cucurbits.

3) Plant resistant cultivars. Pickling cultivars Regal, Royal, Pioneer, Express, Calypso, Cross Country, and Frontier have shown tolerance under Washington and Oregon conditions. Slicing cultivars Victory, Bel Aire, Raider, Encore, Poinsett 76, Slice Nice, Dasher II, Turbo, Quest, and Sprint-N are resistant.

4) Stay out of wet, infected fields.

5) In the Hermiston, OR area, do not irrigate with water draining from another cucumber field.

Cucumber ,(Cucumis sativus)-Bacterial Wilt,"Erwinia tracheiphila, a bacterium that overwinters in the bodies of the striped and 12-spotted cucumber beetles. In Oregon, the disease is on cucumbers occasionally. The bacterium affects plants only in the cucumber family such as cucumber, muskmelon, pumpkin, squash, white gourd, and a number of wild plants.
The relationship between the bacterium and the beetles is very close: if the beetles are eliminated, so is the bacterium. The bacterium hibernates in the digestive tract of a few beetles and in spring finds its way through the feces of the carriers to the young plant. It can enter plant tissue only through deep wounds such as those produced by feeding beetles or, later in the season, grasshoppers. Bacteria are not carried in or on seed.
When beetles chew on affected leaves, which they seem to prefer, their mouth parts are contaminated with bacteria, which they carry to the next few plants on which they feed. Infection occurs only if there is a film of water sufficient for the pathogen to reach the wound in the inner leaf tissue. The beetles do not migrate in rainy periods, and the disease rarely is found where annual rainfall is more than 45 or less than 18 inches. Optimum average daily temperatures for disease development are 52°F to 60°F.


","General wilting of the plant. Infection begins on one or a few leaves, which droop suddenly. This usually is associated with insect damage. The disease spreads from foliage down to the petioles and stems until the plant has wilted and died. Fruit also wilts and shrivels.


","Controlling carrier beetles is effective. See PNW Insect Management Handbook for details.

Cucumber ,(Cucumis sativus)-Fusarium Wilt,"Fusarium wilt is caused by the fungus, Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cucumerinum, which may persist for long periods in the soil as durable spores (chlamydospores) or in association with plant debris. Seed can also transmit Fusarium wilt, usually by contamination of the seed coat. Melon seeds may have an internal infection just under the seed coat.
There is specialization within this fungal species towards various plant hosts affected. These formae speciales of Fusarium oxysporum, which incite Fusarium wilt on cucurbits are as follows: f. sp. benincasae (wax gourd), f. sp. cucumerinum (cucumber), f. sp. lagenariae (calabash gourd), f. sp. luffae (vegetable sponge), f. sp. melonis (muskmelon), f. sp. momordicae (bitter melon), and f. sp. niveum (watermelon). No formae speciales of Fusarium oxysporum has been reported for squash; however, some cultivars of summer squash can be affected by F. oxysporum f. sp. niveum, the wilt strain, which affects watermelon. There are also races within the formae speciales; at least three watermelon races, four melon races, and three cucumber races have been reported.


","The fungus can attack a susceptible plant at any stage of growth. Infection of the hypocotyl of young plants can result in pre- or post-emergence damping-off. Infection of older plants can cause yellowing (starting in the older leaves), stunting, or wilting, and once wilting occurs, death may result in 3 to 5 days. Affected melon plants may develop a lesion on the lower stem. The fungus affects the vascular system and infected plants may not show noticeable symptoms until they begin bearing fruit. Browning of the vascular system is usually evident in the lower stem, crown, or tap root. After the plant dies, a white mycelium mat may form on external plant surfaces. Root rot is not observed.


","

1) Plant clean, quality seed of resistant cultivars. Because there are races of wilt forms, it is necessary to know, which races are present before choosing a resistance variety.

2) Plant on land not previously cropped with the cucurbit species.

3) Liming applications to bring the soil pH to 6.5 to 7.0 can reduce disease.

4) Do not move soil from infested fields.

5) Not replanting to the same cucurbit species for 5 to 7 years can help manage watermelon wilt but is consider ineffective for melon and cucumber wilt.

Infection can occur between 50°F and 90°F with 68°F to 81°F being optimum; temperatures above 100°F are reported to halt disease.
Rarely is the sexual stage (chasmothecium) observed in the Pacific Northwest. However, these fungi readily produce conidia, which can be dispersed from infected plants in greenhouses or in the field. Conidia can be moved by wind across long distances. Warm temperatures and dew formation in summer favor disease development; high relative humidity favors infection while drier conditions promote colony growth as well as production and dispersal of conidia. In 3 to 7 days after infection, colonies are visible. Dense plantings and low light conditions promote disease.


","First, tiny white superficial spots appear on leaves and stem. Spots become powdery white and expand to cover all portions of the plant. Sometimes the mycelium becomes covered with small black structures (chasmothecia) about the size of a pinhead but these chasmothecia are rarely present.

Cucumber ,(Cucumis sativus)-Scab (Gummosis),"A fungus, Cladosporium cucumerinum, that overwinters in cucumber debris and on seed. Spores are disseminated by insects, clothing, and tools, and are blown long distances in moist air. Host penetration occurs less than 9 hours after germination; infection is visible in 3 days. Spore production may occur on the fourth day. The fungus severely injures fruit, which can be infected at all stages of growth but is particularly susceptible while young.


","At first, a sticky substance is exuded in drops as if the trouble were the result of an insect puncture. Spots then gradually turn gray, become slightly sunken, and enlarge to about 0.375 inch in diameter. The canker gradually grows darker, and the tissue collapses farther into the cucumber until a pronounced cavity forms, lined with a dark green, velvety layer of fruiting fungus.
The first symptom on foliage is the appearance of a slightly water-soaked, paler-green area. Spots usually are numerous. Gradually they turn gray-to-white and become angular, often with yellow margins. The fine vein in the spots may remain brown or tan and are distinct against the white background. The dead tissue cracks, breaking away until the whole leaf has a ragged appearance.


","

1) Use a 2- to 3-year rotation with non-cucurbit crops.

2) Plow under plant debris after harvest.

3) Use resistant cultivars whenever available. Scab-resistant cultivars include Dasher II, Raider, Encore, Sprint, Poinsett 76, Turbo, Regal, Flurry, Calypso, Quest, Gemini, Marketmore, Pioneer, SMR-58, and SMR-18. Commercial growers should consult processors for the resistant cultivars to grow.

Cucumber ,(Cucumis sativus)-Verticillium Wilt,,,,,
Cucumber ,(Cucumis sativus)-Virus Diseases,"Several viruses can cause a mosaic symptom including Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV), Zucchini yellows mosaic virus (ZYMV), and Watermelon mosaic virus 2 (WMV2). Each is spread by aphids, and CMV also may be spread by cucumber beetles. CMV overwinters in wild cucumber seed and in wild perennial milkweed, ground cherry, and matrimonial vine.


","CMV-leaves are markedly mottled and wrinkled with yellow and green blotches and edges cupped down. Early-season infection dwarfs the plant; later infections show the typical mosaic symptoms only on late-season growth following infection. Fruit develops raised wart-like bumps with pale, whitish green areas between, and it tastes bitter. Some cultivars of small, later fruit have a pale greenish white appearance.


","

1) Remove all infected vines.

2) Remove wild cucumber vine, milkweed, and other susceptible weed hosts within 1000 ft of the field if possible.

3) Control aphid vectors. See the     for details.

4) Avoid unnecessary field activity, which can spread the virus.

5) In slicing cucumber cultivars, Niagara is resistant; there is also some tolerance to the virus in Dasher II, Multipik, Burpee, Surecrop, Gemini, Marketmore, and Sensation. For pickling cucumbers, the cultivars MR-17, SMR-18, SMR-58, and Pioneer have high tolerance and are recommended for planting.

Cyclamen,Black Root Rot,,,,,
Cyclamen,Botrytis Blight,"Botrytis cinerea (sexual: Botryotinia fuckeliana), a fungus that colonize senescent, dead, dying, or wounded plant parts. Naturally senescing leaves are readily infected. From these infections they can attack healthy tissues. A moist, humid environment is ideal for pathogen sporulation and spread. Initial infections follow a buildup of inoculum on dead and senescing leaves within the canopy. One sufficient inoculum has been released, healthy leaves and flower can be infected. Petioles are often infected followed by adjacent healthy tissues. Conidia may come from sources in and outside the greenhouse. The fungus is everywhere plants are grown and has a wide host range. Shipping and storage conditions that result in the presence of ethylene (such as with fruit) can increase disease.
This fungus may be seedborne and grow systemically in the plant without producing symptoms until flowering and/or senescence.


","The petiole base and flower stalks may rot and may eventually cause whole portions of the plant to collapse. Then the characteristic grayish brown spores of the fungus cover infected tissue. May be confused initially with Fusarium wilt or bacterial soft rot. Petals develop watersoaked flecks that grow into tan necrotic spots. An intense color may form around lesions on colored petals. Spots on dark-flowered cultivars are often white while on colored flowers they are dark-pink-to-red.


","

1) Remove all dead and dying plant parts (particularly blossoms) on and around plants and take them out of the greenhouse. Take care not to injury healthy plants in this process.

2) Maintain a relatively dry environment (humidity below 90%). Increase spacing between plants for good air circulation and take care not to splash water on foliage during watering. Heating the greenhouse at night and/or venting around sunset may be necessary.

3) Using subirrigation systems can also help reduce canopy humidity.

4) Spacing plants also allows better light penetration, reducing senescence of the lower leaves and thus helping reduce the amount of highly susceptible plant tissue.

5) Place fans in greenhouse to get better air circulation.

6) When shipping, use paper not plastic sleeves around plants.

7) The use of ethylene blockers (EthylBloc or Ethylene Buster) before shipping may be helpful.

","Best when used with cultural controls. Tank-mix and/or alternate products from different groups with different modes of action to prevent the buildup of resistant fungi. Limit any one group during the growing season.

Cyclamen,Fusarium Wilt,"Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cyclaminis, a soilborne fungus that causes a vascular wilt of cyclamen. It can be transmitted by seed (or debris associated with the seed) or from plant to plant by overhead watering, contaminated tools, or infested soil. Transmission by shoreflies or fungal gnats is suspected but has not been definitively proven. More plants become infected in an ever-widening circle as the pathogen is moved around. Disease severity is a function of inoculum load. It can survive in contaminated growing media or Styrofoam propagation trays. It survives in the soil as thick-walled, dormant chlamydospores, which germinate in response to exudates from nearby plant roots. Hyphae then penetrate the roots, colonize the cortex, and move into the xylem tissue. Small spores (microconidia) are produced and carried up into the plant. Sphagnum peat media favor disease development. It will not affect different plants grown in the same greenhouse. Temperatures above 70°F favor the disease, which may occur in 2 to 4 weeks. However, at 60°F symptoms may not show for 7 weeks. Drought stress can increase symptom development.
The use of sodium chloride has been reported to have growth benefits but was not effective for disease control.


","Aboveground symptoms include a bright yellowing and wilting first on lower leaves, then on the rest of the plant. Older plants develop chlorotic patches on the leaf blade of at the leaf edge. The corm does not get soft and mushy as with bacterial soft rot, but in cross-section shows patches of reddish-brown to black, or purple, discoloration in the vascular system. Roots exhibit vascular discoloration and may be totally discolored and darkened. Any growth stage is susceptible to infection, wilt, and death. If growing conditions are good, plants may be symptomless until hot weather, heat stress. or flowering occur.


","A strict sanitation program with regular scouting and quick removal of infected plants is critical to overall production.

1) Remove and destroy infected plants as they develop. Scout plants at least once a week.

2) Discard or sterilize contaminated media.

3) Clean bench surfaces with steam or disinfectants.

4) Use composted bark media, which suppress this fungus.

5) Adjust growing medium pH to 6.5 to 7.

6) Shade and cool the greenhouse in summer.

7) Use drip-tubes, capillary mats, or ebb and flow systems rather than overhead irrigation.

8) Use nitrate nitrogen when fertilizing instead of ammoniacal nitrogen.

","Not effective as a sole treatment but must be integrated with cultural controls and/or biologicals. Even then, losses still will occur. Use these materials preventively only. Do not use to salvage the crop, as treatments are generally ineffective and only help increase the risk of developing resistant fungi.

Cyclamen,Impatiens Necrotic Spot,,"The most common symptom of Impatiens necrotic spot virus on cyclamen is necrotic ringspots. They may be concentric, or tissue within the ringspot may become yellow. The petiole end of the leaf may brown, but infection by bacterial soft rot and Fusarium wilt also have this symptom. Early symptoms can include a silvery speckling that resembles thrips damage. Colored flowers may develop light streaks that run the length of the flower. Necrosis in the vascular bundles of the corms also has been observed as well as brown, zigzag line patterns. Symptoms may not occur for several months after exposure to western flower thrips.

Cypress ,(Cupressus spp.)-Canker,"Seiridium cardinale (formerly Coryneum cardinale),  a fungus. Monterey cypress (Cupressus macrocarpa) has the worst damage, but other Cupressus spp. also are affected. Spores are rain splashed; the fungus also can be moved on pruning tools and infected nursery stock. It enters trees through natural occurring wounds or insect damaged tissue. Favored by prolonged periods of mist and light rain with moderate temperatures. Cankers enlarge faster on drought-stressed trees. The fungus can infect many genera of the Cupressaceae including Chamaecyparis, Juniperus, and Thuja, as well as hybrids such as Leyland Cypress. A different species of Seiridium may be involved with cankers of Port-Orford-Cedar in Oregon. Cupressus glabra, C. lusitanica, and C. torulosa are more resistant although not immune.


","Old foliage yellows and browns in spring, followed by a fading green or death of new foliage. Small branches are infected first, then larger ones. A typical lens-shape, sunken canker can be found on the branch below affected foliage. Top death and dieback are common. Bark turns brown, and small, black fruiting bodies (acervuli) may form in the cankered area. Drops of resin frequently are in and at the sides of cankers. The expansion of cankers is slow on large branches and trunks of mature trees. Could be confused with Monochaetia canker.

Cypress ,(Cupressus spp.)-Root Rot,,,,,
Daffodil ,(Narcissus spp.)-Basal Rot,"Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. narcissi, a soilborne fungus that can remain viable for at least 10 years. Basal rot principally affects daffodil bulbs in storage or transit but may develop during later growth stages in the field where bulb yield is reduced. Infection occurs as new roots are emerging and when old roots are dying down or when there is mechanical damage. Root infection and disease development are related to soil temperatures above 55°F. Bulb-to-bulb spread is more important than soilborne inoculum. Excessive nitrogen fertility increases incidence of basal rots, splits, and bruises. Warm storage conditions also favor disease development. The cultivars Carlton, Golden Ducat, Golden Harvest, and Dutch Master are susceptible.


","After planting roots may fail to emerge or may emerge but then become dark colored. Small dark spots may develop on the basal plate. The disease usually begins in the root plate at the base of the scales and spreads through the bulb, generally attacking the central portion first. After infection, the rot extends more rapidly within the scale than across the faces of successive scales, but the fungus can spread in all directions. In partly resistant cultivars, the rot tends to advance in streaks and layers with layers of healthy tissues intervening. Rotted tissue is chocolate or purplish brown. The mycelium appears as a weft of whitish pink threads between the scales. Bulbs become soft, dehydrated, brittle, and then mummified. Shoots from infected bulbs are short lived and crooked while foliage is weak and senesces prematurely. Usually there is no slimy or mushy breakdown.


","

1) Disinfect cutting knives, containers, and equipment.

2) Dig bulbs as early as practical before soil temperatures rise to far; keep them as dry as possible.

3) Prevent sunburning, bruising, and wounding.

4) Discard diseased bulbs or any that are soft, lightweight or damaged.

5) Store bulbs in thin layers under cool (55°F to 60°F) and well-ventilated conditions with good air circulation.

6) Rotate out of daffodils for 8 years or more if practice.

7) Reduce planting density in infected stocks.

8) Avoid high rates of nitrogen.

Disease development and spread can occur very rapidly under mild to warm, moist conditions in the field or in storage after digging. The disease is widespread and can be serious. In the Pacific Northwest, crown rot is more common on bulbous iris, tulips and lilies than daffodils.


","The bulb surface generally is covered with a coarse white growth. Small, reddish brown fungal bodies (sclerotia) may be seen in the growth or in or between scales. Infected plants turn yellow and die prematurely. The disease may be in patches in the field.


","

1) Remove and destroy all infected bulbs and plants.

2) Wash equipment and machinery between fields.

3) Do not plant daffodils in infested soil for at least 3 years.

4) Reduce planting densities.

5) Early digging before the warm temperatures of summer and rapid drying of harvested bulbs has been helpful.

Daffodil ,(Narcissus spp.)-Fire,"Botrytis polyblastis (sexual: Botryotinia polyblastis), a fungus that survives as sclerotia on plant residue in soil. In the spring, these sclerotia produce apothecia and ascospore infection is limited to the flowers. The Botrytis stage then sporulates on infected flowers with conidia blown by the wind to foliage. Initial leaf infections are from spores produced on these infected flowers. Sclerotia are then produced in the dead foliage. The disease is infrequent and sporadic but can destroy all foliage in late spring, reducing bulb yields and subsequent flower production.


","Flowers are affected first. Edges show water-soaked areas that enlarge, turn brown, and wither. Leaf symptoms consist of small, elongated, grayish spots that enlarge and turn brown. Shortly after spots appear, leaves begin to yellow and die. All foliage may be destroyed within a couple of weeks under favorable (warm and moist) conditions.


","Focus on cultural tactics, especially de-heading and removal of flowers in production fields.

1) Rotate out of daffodils for 2 years.

2) Remove all flowers in tight bud before they become infected.

Leaves and flower stalks may be injured as they push up between bulb scales. Under moist or humid conditions, spores infect the plant through these injuries or other wounds. Cultivars vary in resistance but it is reported as a common problem on Gand Soleil d'Or and Magnificence.


","Yellow-red or brown spots appear on the top 2 to 3 inches of leaves as or soon after they emerge from the soil. A yellow band separates diseased from healthy tissue. Small, water-soaked spots with yellow centers appear in discolored leaves or on adjacent leaves.

Daffodil ,"(Narcissus spp.)-Nematode, Root-lesion","Pratylenchus penetrans and P. crenatus. P. penetrans is much more important because of its general distribution and wide host range. Root-lesion nematodes are migratory endoparasites; part of the population is in soil and part in roots at all times. Although not specially examined in the PNW, much of the damage is due to a fungus, Ilyonectria destructans, which gains entry into roots through lesion nematode feeding sites. The root rot has been called decline, replant disease and soil sickness in earlier literature.


","Prematurely yellow foliage and early-maturing plants in target-spot areas of a field usually indicate nematode damage. Infested areas may be difficult to find in an unusually wet season. Roots are greatly reduced; most show dark lesions or dead spots. If plants are severely infected, bulbs have no roots left. Because plants are damaged and mature early, bulb size is greatly reduced.


","

1) Rotate 5 years out of bulbs and remove volunteer plants from previous bulb crops.

2) Soak lightly infected stocks in properly designed equipment, when bulbs are fully dormant. Soak 4 hours in water at 110°F to 111°F soon after digging bulbs. The treatment can distort flowers and leaves and spreads basal rot disease from infected to healthy bulbs; therefore, do not treat basal-rot-infected stock with hot water.

Daffodil ,"(Narcissus spp.)-Nematode, Stem and Bulb","Ditylenchus dipsaci. Infected bulbs are mostly responsible for carrying over infestations and establishing new ones. Stem nematodes infect aboveground plant parts and also are in soil. Can destroy a bulb stock in as little as 3 years. Although they can move short distances on their own, they can be spread passively by moving soil or water. Spread down rows in the direction of soil cultivation is common. The life cycle can be completed within the bulb in storage or in the field. Adults can lay up to 500 eggs, which go through 4 larval stages with the fourth stage being infective. Can also be a problem on tulip, hyacinth and phlox. Different races or biotypes occur with the tulip race highly pathogenic while the hyacinth race causes only minor lesions. The narcissus race can breed slowly in onions, beans, peas and strawberries.


","Foliage is distorted and off-color, yellow to brown depending on time of year. Sometimes, planting zones are severely stunted or rows have barren areas. Infected plants seldom produce satisfactory flowers, and blooming may be delayed or absent. Leaves have localized thickened areas called spikels. These are small, broken, roughened, swollen, yellow patches that usually occur along the leaf margin or the keel of the flower stalk. Infected bulbs have poor root development. Bulb cross-sections show brownish areas in the concentric rings of bulb tissue. Many infected bulbs soften, rot, and disintegrate in storage. Infected bulbs may dehydrate resulting in a survival structure exuding from around the base plate. These pinhead-sized blobs of off-white wool-like material will rehydrate with nematodes becoming active. Roots are not attacked.


","

1) Discard heavily infected plants and bulbs. Remove healthy appear plants for up to 3 feet from infected plants.

2) Harvest infected stocks early, before tops die completely.

3) Disinfect used work areas, trays, cases, tools, and equipment by steam or hot water (185°F).

4) Rotate 5 years out of bulbs andremove volunteer plants from previous bulb crops.

5) Soak lightly infected stocks in properly designed equipment, when bulbs are fully dormant. Soak 4 hours in water at 110°F to 111°F.

Daffodil ,(Narcissus spp.)-Smoulder,"The fungus Botrytis narcissicola survives as sclerotia within bulb scales near the neck or in leaf debris. Emerging leaf tips are infected when they contact germinating sclerotia on the bulb or in the soil. Masses of spores produced in this tissue can infect injured or senescent leaves and flowers. The fungus also can enter the bulb by growing downward through infected leaves and flower stalks. The fungus can also colonize the cut end of stems after harvesting flowers. Plants showing symptoms the previous year will generally show symptoms the following year. Infection is favored by cool wet conditions, frost, hail, multiple-nosed bulbs, and leaving stocks in the ground more than 1 year. Pollen grains can also enhance infection at higher (64°F) temperatures. Bulb yields may be reduced. The cultivar Dutch Master was reported as least susceptible while Ice Follies was most susceptible.


","Newly emerging leaves become red-brown, distorted, and rotten. If partially infected, leaves show a shepherd's crook symptom. Neck rot also may develop. Lesions that develop on leaves later in the year are dark brown and bounded by yellowing areas. Often there are several lesions per leaf, which sometimes spread rapidly and coalesce to cause withering and death of the whole lamina. Flower stalks may be dwarfed with misshapen flower buds.

Daffodil ,(Narcissus spp.)-Virus Diseases,"Twenty-one viruses are known to infect daffodil. Two commonly observed are Narcissus yellow stripe virus (NYSV) and Narcissus white streak virus (NWSV). Both are potyviruses and, after more research, may be found to be the same virus. Aphids are a natural vector for these viruses but spread is slow. These viruses can also be spread by alternately handling healthy and infected plants during flower packing and other operations. They are not seedborne. Other viruses common in the PNW and possible on daffodil include Cucumber mosaic virus and Tomato spotted wilt virus.


","NYSV-infected plants are characterized by light-green, grayish-green, or dull to bright-yellow stripes or mottles mostly confined to the upper two-thirds of the leaf. The surface of the discolored area is most often roughened near veins and may have a peculiar twist. White streaks or blotches may appear on flowers, which are reduced in size. The cultivar Magnificence develops only green stripes.
Narcissus White Streak symptoms appear about flowering time (after temperatures exceed 64°F) on leaves and flower stems as narrow, dark green to purple streaks. Streaks later become white, yellowish white, or gray and may coalesce. They soon become necrotic and sunken, and the leaves die. Plants decline and produce smaller-than-normal bulbs.
Frost injury, water logging, and herbicide damage may be confused with virus diseases. However, virus-diseased plants will usually be scattered, while plants without virus problems are in a more uniform area.


","

1) Remove diseased plant.

2) Plant foundation stocks as far as possible from newly purchased stocks or commercial fields.

3) Purchase and plant virus-tested (and found to be free of known viruses) material.

4) Plant only the largest bulbs.

5) Control aphid vectors. See the for details.

The disease has been found in a few dahlia cultivars: Brandaris, Pop Harris, Oakleigh Champion, Gold Rose, K.S. Snowball, Mary Elizabeth, and Kidd Climax. Probably all cultivars are susceptible. The nematode has occurred infrequently, probably from the introduction of infested dahlia tubers.


","No aboveground symptoms or unusual growth behaviors are associated with affected plants. The cortex of most affected roots usually is roughened in some manner. Roughening greatly hinders an early detection of superficial necrosis that may be the result of any initial infection. Any area with unusually transverse longitudinal cracking, or showing evidence of cortex flaking or sloughing, should be regarded with suspicion. In advanced stages, infected tissues discolor brown to black. The progressive breakdown is a dry granular type.

Dahlia,Virus Diseases,"The following viruses are a problem on dahlia and include Tomato spotted wilt virus, which has a thrips vector, Dahlia mosaic virus (DMV), which has an aphid vector, and a tomato-ringspot-related virus which most likely has a nematode vector. DMV can be transmitted by 16 different aphid species, mechanical inoculation and through the seed. It was detected in cotyledons but rarely in the seed coat. Research in Washington has found 3 viruses associated with mosaic symptoms including Dahlia mosaic virus (DMV), Dahlia common mosaic virus (DCMV), and an endogenous plant pararetroviral sequence (DvEPRS).


","Dahlia mosaic produces distinct chlorosis along veins and may shorten the internodes, giving a stunted or bushy appearance in tolerant cultivars. A survey of commercial gardens, retail outlets, trial gardens and backyards around the USA found a wide range of symptoms in DMV infected plants that could not be correlated to cultivar. These symptoms included mosaic, chlorotic spots, general chlorosis of leaves, systemic chlorosis, deformation of newly emerging foliage and stunting.
The tomato-ringspot-related virus produces necrotic patches and marginal necrosis on the leaf blade.


","

Dahlia,Wilt,"Verticillium dahliae and/or Fusarium oxysporum, fungi that live indefinitely in soil and may be carried in infected tubers. Verticillium grows into the xylem where it colonizes the plant through mycelial growth and conidial production. Conidia are transported passively by the fluid movement in the xylem. Once in the xylem, this fungus partially blocks water movement and produces toxins that result in wilt symptoms.


","Vascular stem tissues darken near the soil level. The top of the plant wilts and dies back. Roots have brown-black streaks.


","

1) Use only healthy tubers for propagation.

2) Remove wilted plants to prevent the fungus from accumulating in soil.

3) Practice flowerbed (crop) rotation.

4) Destroy all affected dahlia stems. Do not add them to the compost pile unless you are hot composting.

5) Sterilize soil with steam, or use a soilless potting mix.

Daphne,Root Rot,"Phytophthora sp., a fungus-like microorganism. This organism can survive as a resting structure (chlamydospores and oospores), as hyphae in the roots of diseased plants and in crop debris. It is easily spread in contaminated potting media, disease cuttings or liners and splashing or flowing water. Recycled irrigation water can also be a source. Cool, wet, or waterlogged soil favors disease development. The disease also can occur on sloping ground if soil stays excessively wet.


","Above ground, foliage and flowers wilt, or the entire plant collapses. Dark brown to black, irregular, water-soaked lesions appear on the stem near the soil line. These may coalesce into larger lesions that girdle the plant. Invaded cambium turns brownish black and is sharply delineated from adjoining healthy areas. Affected roots disintegrate rapidly.


","

1) Improve water drainage around plantings.

2) Reduce irrigation amount and frequency.

3) Maintain at a slightly acidic pH and do not overfertilize with nitrogen.

4) Remove and destroy infected plant and potting material including leaves, cuttings, plants, and potting media.

5) Collect cuttings for propagation only from healthy stock plants.

Daylily ,(Hemerocallis spp.)-Daylily Rust,"The fungus Puccinia hemerocallidis is an exotic rust native to Asia. This pathogen was detected in daylily (Hemerocallis spp.) nursery stock in the southeast in 2000. It has since spread to many other states and was detected at one site in Benton Co., Oregon in 2001. The infected plants were imported from a nursery in Florida. An eradication program was implemented at that site and none was found in 2002.
This rust can cycle on daylily alone or can use Patrinia as an aecial host in a heteroecious cycle. In Georgia, it was noted that the disease did not overwinter on plants that were killed to the ground. However, it may survive on evergreen cultivars or in regions with mild winters. Although infected nursery stock can spread the disease long distances, the spores of the fungus can be blown great distances. Spores germinate rapidly on wet leaves, can complete the infection process in as little as 5 hours once the leaf is wet at 72°F and can produce new uredinia in 1 to 2 weeks.
Many cultivars appear to be resistant to infection or produce few symptoms including Prairie Blue Eyes, Carolyn, Criswell, Mardi Gras Parade, Woodside Ruby, Hush Little Baby, Follow Your Heart, Chicago Apache, Buttered Popcorn, Green Flutter, Plum Perfect, Frankly Scarlet, Mama Cha Cha, Chinese Scholar and Charlie Pierce Memorial. Some cultivars noted to be highly susceptible include Stella DOro, Attribution, Pardon Me, Gertrude Condon, Crystal Tide, Starstruck, Imperial Guard, and Double Buttercup.


","Orange pustules (uredinia) erupt from leaf tissue of susceptible hosts. Lesions may be roughly angular, vein bounded and can appear on both leaf surfaces. Lesions vary from bright yellow to tan and water-soaked depending on the daylily cultivar. Leaves die quickly leading to large amounts of dead foliage. Resistant cultivars may produce only barely visible flecks.


","

1) Cut, collect, and destroy infected leaves and the leaves from other daylilies in that bed.

2) Collect and remove all leaf debris at season's end.

Delphinium,Damping-off,"Damping-off can develop on the seed, radicle, hypocotyl, epicotyl, or stem of an emerged seedling. Damping-off is caused by the organisms Pythium spp., Rhizoctonia solani, and/or Fusarium spp. These organisms can also cause stem lesions and root rot of older delphinium plants.
Fusarium survives in the soil as thick-walled, dormant chlamydospores, which germinate in response to exudates from nearby plant roots. Hyphae then penetrate the roots, colonize the cortex, and move into the xylem tissue. Small spores (microconidia) are produced and carried up into the plant.
Rhizoctonia survives in the soil as sclerotia or as mycelium colonizing bits of organic matter. Roots become infected as they grow past these structures. The fungus then grows along the root surface, forms an aggregation called an infection cushion, and pushes into the root where it colonies, spreads, and kills the tissue. The fungus can form knots of mycelium that develop into sclerotia. These are released into the soil as the plant debris decomposes.


","Poor stand development or seedling collapse are indicative of damping-off. Seeds or emerging radicles may be rotted. After emergence, stem, root, and cotyledon may rot at or below the soil.
Pythium spp. causes a soft, mushy rot of ungerminated seeds. Once the radicle is extended or plant emerged, tissues can be attacked at any point. The infection starts as a brown, water-soaked spot that enlarges, becomes soft, and collapses.
Rhizoctonia solani will cause reddish brown to dark brown lesions that become slightly sunken. Stem and root lesions often are shallow but may extend deeper in young stem or root tissue. Sometimes, brown mycelia on the surface of the lesions may be visible with a hand lens.
Fusarium spp. causes darker red lesions that become brown with reddish borders to brown lesions with diffuse margins or similarly discolored longitudinal streaks. Stem and root lesions extend deep into the plant tissue.


","

1) Plant seeds at the proper depth in well-drained soil of a high pH.

2) Seed germination usually is higher if soils are moistened regularly but not saturated. It is important for the soil to dry down without drying out.

3) Seeds should be planted when temperatures favor rapid germination and growth, so plants rapidly emerge and reach a more mature or hardened state.

4) Avoid reusing pots or trays from a previous crop for propagation. If pots must be reused then wash off all debris and soak in a sanitizing solution or treat with aerated steam for 30 min.

","Chemical treatment should be preceded by an accurate diagnosis since most of the chemicals are not effective against all the pathogens that might cause damping-off.

Delphinium,Leaf Spot and Crown Rot,"The fungus Calophoma aquilegiicola (formerly Diplodina delphinii) has been found by the OSU Plant Clinic. The fungus overwinters on host debris and in the crown of living plants. The disease is favored by warm wet weather, high humidity, and excessive fertilization. Injury is not needed for the fungus to gain entry into various plant parts. In the Eastern United States, the disease was found to be a problem on Delphinium elatum and several commercial cultivars but not on D. grandiflorum or D. cardinale. The fungus may also be a problem on clematis.
Many other fungi can cause leaf spots on delphinium but only a few have been reported in the PNW including Ramularia crassiuscula (formerly Ramularia delphinii)  and Stagonosporopsis delphinii (formerly Phyllosticta delphinii).


","Leaf spots, stem cankers and crown rots are associated with this fungus. Leaf spots are similar to those produced by bacterial leaf spot. Tarry black lesions on the upper leaf surface and light brown lesions on the lower leaf surface. Petioles develop brown water-soaked areas especially near the base of succulent plants. Less vigorous plants show black local lesions on the petiole. Inflorescences and seed pods develop a blackish decay.
Lower stems show localized, brown to black necrotic lesions that are variable in size and shape. Small back fruiting bodies (pycnidia) may be seen in a concentric arrangement in the diseased area. Crowns and root develop black or dark brown vascular systems. The entire crown may rot along with the sudden wilting and death of the entire plant. Generally, crown rot is found on plants 2 or more years old. Young tender basal shoots arising from the crown develop a brown to black water soft rot similar to petioles.

Delphinium,Powdery Mildew,"Several fungi such as  Erysiphe spp. and Podosphaera spp.  can cause powdery mildew but only Erysiphe polygoni and Golovinomyces cichoracearum (formerly Erysiphe cichoracearum) have been reported from the PNW. Conidia are released in response to abrupt decreases in relative humidity. Wind blows conidia to healthy foliage where they start new mildew colonies. Too much water, such as flowing water or rain, destroys spores by causing them to burst. The fungus does not grow in a leaf but rather across the surface. Small anchor cells of the fungus, haustoria, remain in the leaf and take nourishment from the plant, but the main filament and the multitudes of spores it produces are outside the leaf. The disease can develop under relatively dry conditions in spring and summer so long as the air is humid. Plants in shade tend to have more problems because that environment favors disease development. Multiple disease cycles occur during the growing season.


","White or grayish patches on leaves, stems and sometimes closed delphinium buds late in summer. Leaves turn yellow and die from the base of the stem up. Plant vigor and stem quality can be reduced. Curling and stunting of young leaves and growing tips occur when infections are severe.

Delphinium,Pythium Crown and Root Rot,"Several species of Pythium can rot Delphinium species as well as many other bedding and garden plants. It has been found by the OSU Plant Clinic. All Pythium species are strongly favored by abundant moisture and can be especially problematic in poorly drained potting media and planting sites. Pythium usually attacks seeds or seedlings, however, older plants may also be affected, especially if the soil is too wet. Pythium spp. can survive in dust, planting media, or soil particles on greenhouse floors, flats, and pots. Spread can also occur via movement of infected plants. Damaged plants are more easily infected. The disease is usually favored by cool, moist conditions in the field and wet waterlogged soils.


","Often the first symptoms are yellow and brown leaves. The plant may be stunted and, at more advanced stages, may wilt. Inspection of the collar area of the stem, at and just below the soil line, reveals brown, water-soaked lesions. The lesions may be limited or girdle the whole stem. Diseased roots are brown, often starting at the root tips. The cortical layer of rotted cells can easily be pulled away from the white vascular tissue. If roots are pulled when the rot is extensive, the cortical tissue may have already sloughed off, leaving the white vascular tissue.


","

1) Plant in a well-drained site.

2) Plant in raised beds if the site is poorly drained. A small grade of composted bark can be incorporated in the soil of the raised bed to improve aeration. Also, put in drainage tile to facilitate soil drainage and direct water away from the site.

3) Avoid reusing pots or trays from a previous crop for propagation. If pots must be reused then wash off all debris and soak in a sanitizing solution or treat with aerated steam for 30 min.

Delphinium,Stem Canker,"Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. delphinii has been reported on delphinium from Washington. The fungus usually infects the roots or stems through wounds. Macroconidia and microconidia are formed in sporodochia on stems and can be disseminated by windblown and/or splashed rain. Warm temperatures, wet conditions favor disease severity, and pH has little effect. While the resting structures (chlamydospores) formed in plant debris can survive 1 year, the fungus can grow and reproduce in the soil without a host, so the pathogen can live many years in the same site.


","Sunken, water-soaked lesions appear on petioles and stems. Lesions expand inward and rapidly lengthwise and may coalesce. These lesions  darken yet retain a water-soaked appearance. The fungus is visible as numerous salmon-color pustules of spores (sporodochia) in the cankered area, which becomes sunken and cracked. The pith cavity below the canker is filled with white mycelia. In cross section, the vascular bundles of stems and petiols are discolored. Older leaves turn yellow and brown. The fungus may infect roots and invade vascular tissues, resulting in poorly developed root systmes, wilting, and killing the plant. Before death, the inflorescences droop, and leaves yellow, droop, and curl up.


","

1) Use disease free transplants or seeds.

2) Remove affected stems as soon as they are detected.

3) Applying nitrate forms of nitrogen (versus ammonium nitrogen) helps reduce disease severity but will not eliminate the disease.

4) Do not plant delphinium in a bed where the disease has been a problem. Rotate to other areas for several years.

5) Infested soil can be removed and clean soil used to refill a bed area.

6) Preplant soil solarization has been helpful in reducing populations of certain soilborne pathogens and weeds in western Oregon. Place clear plastic (preferably anti-condensation film) directly on smooth, rototilled ground, which has been irrigated to field capacity and then allowed to drain for 1-2 days. Bury the edges of the plastic to trap the heat. Solarize for 4-6 weeks (or longer) during the hottest part of the summer, beginning in early- to mid-July.

","Not effective as a sole treatment but must be integrated with cultural controls. Use these materials preventively only at seeding or transplanting. Do not use to salvage the crop, as treatments are generally ineffective and only help increase the risk of developing resistant fungi.

Delphinium,Stem Rot,"The fungus Sclerotinia sclerotiorum has an extremely wide host range infecting 383 plant species in at least 64 families. The disease develops in cool, wet conditions and is more prevalent when plants form a complete, compact canopy that holds high relative humidity. Individual sclerotia (survival structure of the fungus) can survive 3 years, but the fungus can colonize dead organic plant matter and survive many years. Burying sclerotia deeper than 2 inches prevents production of airborne spores, but burial as deep as 24 inches is needed to reduce sclerotia survival. Tilling can pull sclerotia back toward the surface.
In the potato system, flowers are very susceptible to infection and are the main source of stem infection. Infected petals fall onto stems allowing the fungus to gain entry into the stems. Direct penetration, of stems in contact with the soil, from germinating soilborne sclerotia also occurs.


","The newer delphinium shoots and leaflets wilt first, followed by whole branches (usually lower ones), which progress to wilting of the entire plant. Cankers are on the lower stem and become extensive as the wilt progresses. The fungus may be white, fluffy mycelia at the base of the stem and/or internally in the pith. Black, irregularly oval sclerotia about 0.125 to 0.75 inch long form on the surface of the stem, on the soil, and in the stem.


","

1) Remove infected plants when symptoms first appear.

2) After the disease is detected, plant only tolerant plants such as alyssum, daffodil, salvia, pansy, or ornamental grasses. Resistant crops include rushes, sedges and the fountain grass .

3) Space plants for good air circulation, quick drying and so they aren't crowded when they reach maximum size.

4) Avoid frequent watering; let soils dry partially before watering again.

Delphinium,Tomato Spotted Wilt,,"Pale green, circular, elliptical, or irregular areas that may become surrounded by chlorotic rings occur on leaves. On some leaves, numerous concentric rings varying in size occur. Chlorotic rings surrounding green centers may also be seen. Some leaves may show green or chlorotic banding of veins in large lemon-yellow blotches that may or may not have rings. In advanced stages of the disease, black rings varying in size surround chlorotic tissue which eventually becomes black on the lower leaves. Black patches spread on most of the lobes on the leaves, and petioles, and veins become necrotic. The lower leaves turn brown and dry with the blackened areas still visible.

Dill ,(Anethum graveolens)-Sclerotinia Stem and Crown Rot,"Sclerotinia sclerotiorum is a fungus that overwinters as small black structures (sclerotia) attached to decomposing infected plant portions. Sclerotia may survive more than several years. After a moisture-conditioning period of at least 70 days, they produce a small, stalked, cup-shaped fruiting structure (apothecium), which releases spores into the air. Spores may infect blossoms and senescing leaves. After colonizing, the fungus can invade healthy parts of the plant. Moist conditions within the plant canopy during bloom favor infection, as do rain, dew, and/or irrigation practices that keep foliage wet for long periods.
Other host plants include bean, carrots, pea, lettuce, potato, green pepper, cucurbits, parsnip, radish, other crucifers including canola, flower seed crops, and sunflower. Dandelion (Taraxacum officinale) is a very susceptible weed host.


","The disease is mainly on the lower portion of stems, producing a cottony white mold under wetter conditions or a light-brown appearance to the affected stem area. As the stems decay, small dark sclerotial bodies appear inside. Plants may die before seed harvest.

Dogwood ,(Cornus spp.)-Anthracnose,"Discula destructiva, (formerly Gloeosporium sp.), a fungus that overwinters on dead twigs and on leaves on the tree and ground. Tiny brown fruiting bodies (acervuli) of the fungus are easy to see on dead twigs and leaves. Spores are dispersed by rain and wind then initiate new infections on succulent tissues in the spring. Conidial germ tubes penetrate leaves and tender stems directly. Shade and prior drought favor disease development.
Pacific dogwood (Cornus nuttallii) is very susceptible. Flowering dogwood (C. florida) is moderately susceptible but is severely damaged under conditions ideal for disease development. Many but not all cultivars of Kousa dogwood (C. kousa) are very resistant (C. kousa var. chinensis has been quite susceptible in some studies). Bunchberry (C. canadensis), cornelian cherry dogwood (C. mas), and Japanese cornel dogwood (C. officinalis) are thought to be resistant.


","Most common are large, brown, irregularly shaped blotches on leaves. Often, the diseased area is at or near the leaf tip, centered approximately on the midvein. The blotch often spreads down the midvein, giving a wedge-shaped appearance to the diseased area. Instead of blotches, leaves occasionally have brown spots with dark brown to purple margins. Infected leaves commonly drop before autumn, leaving the tree partially or totally leafless. Affected twigs have sunken tan to brown spots with purple borders, which eventually enlarge and girdle the twig, resulting in twig dieback. Dead gray leaves often remain on the tips of these infected twigs all winter and spring.

Dogwood ,(Cornus spp.)-Branch Cankers,"Various fungi such as Phoma, Phomopsis, and Cytospora. Neonectria ditissima (formerly Nectria galligena)  is a problem on native dogwood. Usually these fungi are opportunistic and are able to attack only trees weakened by drought, cold, root problems, or wounds and mechanical injury. A canker of Cornus nuttallii has been described on wounded trees associated with land clearing in southern British Columbia caused by Dothichiza ambigua (formerly Sclerophoma ambigua).


","Leaf scorch, wilt, or leaf death may be the first indication that something is wrong. Examining the affected branch reveals a sunken dark brown canker with a sharp border between diseased and healthy tissue. Smaller branches may be girdled by the canker, resulting in dieback of everything distal to the canker.
Nectria canker - Small depressed areas of bark around a wound or at the base of a dead branch. The bark over the canker becomes darker than normal and cracked at the edges. Older cankers are often a series of target-like rings or may be completely covered by old bark. Small, red, round perithecia might be seen on some cankers.
Dothichiza canker-Young cankers appear as slightly sunken areas in the bark. Older cankers have bark that is dead and cracked in the center. Beneath the canker, the wood is usually stained grayish-brown. Cankers may occur at any height and may vary in length from a few inches to several feet. The large cankers are usually found only on one side of the stem. Cankers extend more rapidly vertically than laterally, resulting in confluence of cankers, but little girdling. Complete recovery of a tree seems to be rare, but may continue to live for several years. The fungus may fruit in the dead bark of the large cankers, but the presence of epiphytic lichens tends to obscure the pycnidia.


","

1) Identify sources of stress and alleviate them when possible. For example, too much water will stress dogwood.

2) Prune out and destroy affected branches.

","Fungicides are not warranted, since these fungi are not aggressive pathogens on native or cultivated dogwood.

Dogwood ,(Cornus spp.)-Collar Rot,"Phytophthora cactorum, a soilborne fungus-like microorganism. This organism can survive as a resting structure (chlamydospores and oospores), as hyphae in the roots of diseased plants and in crop debris. It is easily spread in contaminated potting media, disease cuttings and splashing or flowing water. Recycled irrigation water can also be a source. Generally it enters through trunk wounds but also can enter from infected roots. Saturated soils due to rain or overwatering favor the disease.


","As a result of the developing canker on the trunk near the soil or on the main roots, usually the first symptom is the lack of vigor and unthriftiness of the tree top. Leaves are small and light green. As the disease progresses, twigs and branches die. At first only one part or side of the tree may show symptoms; however, within 2 to 3 years, symptoms may be apparent over the entire tree.
In the canker at the base of the trunk, the inner bark, cambium, and sapwood are discolored. As the canker progresses, the affected area becomes sunken; the bark falls away, exposing the wood. The tree dies when the canker girdles the trunk or root crown.


","

1) Avoiding trunk wounds is the most important control.

2) Prevent overhead irrigation water from wetting trunks. Do not overwater on low water use (cloudy and/or cool) days.

3) Remove and destroy all infected plants and plant debris.

4) Surgery of small cankers is recommended in BC to prolong tree life. Remove diseased tissue in dry weather using a sharp knife. Leave wound exposed to air during the summer and do not cover with soil or mulch.

","Use fungicides as preventative treatments. The Group 4 and 33 fungicides used to manage Phytophthora do not kill this organism. They can only prevent establishment of the organism before it gets into the plant. They can also prevent continued growth if the organism is already inside the plant thereby delaying symptoms that might have developed. Once chemical activity has subsided with time, the organism can resume growth within infected plants. Rotate fungicides from different groups that have a different mode of action for resistance management.

Dogwood ,(Cornus spp.)-Leaf Scorch,"Leaf scorch and leaf roll result from stress. Drought, heat stress, overwatering, and construction damage are possible causes of both problems. Leaf scorch also can be caused by overfertilization. Similar symptoms can be caused by herbicide damage.


",". Leaf scorch is characterized by browning of the tips and margins of the leaves. Leaf roll is a puckering and upward rolling of the leaf along the midvein. The undersides of rolled leaves are often pinkish or purplish.


","

1) Avoid compacting soil, which inhibits water penetration into the soil and reduces drainage.

2) Provide proper irrigation and fertilization for your plants, especially during dry weather.

3) Try to prevent injury to the roots and trunk, especially during construction or soil excavation.

",,
Dogwood ,(Cornus spp.)-Leaf Spots,"Leaf spots may be caused by a wide variety of fungi including Cercospora, Elsinoe corni (cause of spot anthracnose), Phyllosticta, Ramularia, Septoria, Sphaceloma, Phlyctema vagabunda and others. Botrytis cinerea often comes in as a secondary pathogen once these other fungi have killed the tissue. Botrytis will also cause spotting and blight on leaves injured by cold temperatures. Leaf spots are more prevalent during and following very wet spring weather. Occasionally severe enough to cause defoliation, these fungi are sporadic and usually do not significantly impact the tree's overall health.


","Leaves develop small (less than 0.25 inch) round or angular spots, often with a purplish or brown border. Some lesions may have a whitish bloom in their centers. Elsinoe corni also affect the flower bracts, young shoots, and fruit. Stem and fruit spots are often dark and slightly raised. Septoria causes angular brown leaf spots up to 0.25 inch, often with a purple border. Tiny round fruiting bodies, pycnidia, can be seen with a hand lens on the upper surfaces. Cercospora leaf spots are similar but do not have the fruiting bodies.


","

1) Choose to grow resistant cultivars.

2) Rake and destroy leaves in the fall.

3) Avoid overhead irrigation or apply such that trees are not wet for extended periods of time.

","Fungicides usually are not warranted in yards or landscapes because these fungi usually do not significantly damage the tree. Fungicides may be used if leaf spots were severe the previous year and the weather is very wet. Apply fungicides at regular intervals from bud swell through bloom.

Dogwood ,(Cornus spp.)-Powdery Mildew,"Erysiphe pulchra (formerly Microsphaera penicillata) and Phyllactinia guttata can produce white mycelial growth on leaves, buds, flowers, and new stems of dogwood. Powdery mildew on dogwood has been an increasing problem in Southeastern States since 1995, was reported from Washington during 1999 and found in Oregon in 2002. The predominant pathogen in Tennessee, Erysiphe, overwinters as black spherical spore structures (chasmothecia) on leaf debris. Chasmothecia release ascospores in spring. New growth is particularly susceptible to infection. Conidia are produced on mycelia that colonize new plant growth and are the spore type that caused new infections through the growing season. Under favorable conditions, this fungus can go from spore to spore in as little as 7 days. Buds may become infected but do not appear to be an important overwintering site.
Disease-resistant species, hybrids and flowering cultivars are available including Cornus alba, C. alternifolia, C. controversa, C. kousa, C. mas, and C. sericea. Many red-flower cultivars of Cornus florida are susceptible while only a few white flowering types are resistant.


","The disease is on foliage, current-year twigs, blossoms, fruit, and buds. The first symptom is often yellow patchy areas on a leaf that become necrotic. A white, very thin, dry growth (mycelium) that is somewhat similar in appearance to a very dense covering of plant hair develops on the lower leaf surface directly below affected leaf spots. All plant parts can become covered with mycelia and spores (conidia). If newly expanding tissue is affected, the growth of that part is restricted or distorted. During late summer and early fall, a peppered speckling (chasmothecia) may develop on the white to light gray growth on leaf surfaces.


","

1) Disease-resistant cultivars of  include Karen's Appalachian Blush, Jean's Appalachian Snow, Kay's Appalachian Mist, and Appalachian Joy. The  hybrids 'Aurora', 'Constellation', 'Galaxy', 'Stardust', and 'Stellar Pink' are highly resistant.

2) Improve air circulation to reduce relative humidity and accelerate drying of foliage. Space plants well and plant in more exposed areas; especially avoid planting in heavily shaded areas.

3) Irrigate with microjet sprinklers or soaker hoses to avoid wetting foliage.

4) If practical, prune out and destroy infected tissue as it appears early in the year. If disease continues to build up, stop removing leaves; removing too many leaves is damaging.

5) In the fall, rake up and destroy fallen leaves.

","With an active scouting program, fungicides can be started at the first sign of disease. Fungicides will do best when used before symptoms develop. Few materials have good eradicant activity. Use at 7- to 14-day intervals; using shorter intervals when environmental conditions favor disease development. Alternate or tank-mix products from different groups that have different modes of action. Limit the use of any one group during the growing season.

Dogwood ,(Cornus spp.)-Root Rot,"Several fungi have been associated with necrotic roots of declining trees, but their importance is undetermined. Dogwoods weakened by adverse environmental conditions and poor cultural care are most susceptible to root rot. Trees planted too deeply, in full sun, in poorly drained areas, and those damaged by mechanical injury are at risk. Phytophthora sp. has been found by the OSU Plant Clinic. Cornus nuttallii was experimentally infected with 2 species including P. cinnamomi.


","Root rots cause crown thinning, twig dieback, foliar discoloration, marginal leaf scorch, and wilt. Roots under the bark will be discolored or have black fungal zone lines in them. Secondary roots may be pinched off, leaving only discolored stubs, or may be lacking altogether.


","Preventive measures are paramount.

1) Plant no deeper than the tree grew in the nursery. Dogwoods have shallow root systems, and planting too deeply can mean the tree will fail to thrive.

2) Dogwoods are understory trees, so plant where they will have at least partial shade.

3) Provide supplemental water during the summer; water with a soaker hose 6 inches deep once a week. Do not overwater.

4) Provide good drainage, plant on a mound, or consider planting a different tree when planting into a wet site.

5) Mulch under the tree to conserve moisture during the summer and insulate the shallow roots from heat and cold. Mulch 4 to 6 inches deep out as far as the branches reach (drip line). This also helps prevent injury to the trunk from string weeders or lawn mowers.

6) Once a tree is in decline from root rot, it is best to remove it. Do not replant with another dogwood before determining why the first one died and correcting the conditions that led to its demise.

Dracaena,Leaf Spots,"Many fungi and bacteria cause a leaf spot on Dracaena spp., but Phoma draconis (formerly Phyllosticta draconis) is most common. Peperomia also is susceptible. Wet, humid conditions favor disease development. Yellow spots can also be from magnesium deficiency.


","Lesions appear mainly on older leaves, starting as irregularly shaped, yellow areas that later turn brown with a purple margin. Fruiting fungal bodies (pycnidia) form in necrotic areas. Occasionally, a bright yellow halo may form around older lesions.


","

1) Reduce moisture on leaves. Water from below foliage.

2) Remove and destroy infected leaves.

3) Move to a location with better light, and add Epsom salts for the yellow-spot condition.

Dracaena,Tip Burn,"Both Dracaena deremensis and D. fragrans (corn plant) are very sensitive to fluoride toxicity. Although there are many natural sources or fluoride in water, many municipal water sources inject fluorine (at 1ppm) as an additive to prevent tooth decay. Use of this water for irrigation can result in toxicity symptoms on sensitive plants. Fluoride is an accumulative poison in plant foliage. Accumulation may be gradual over time. Fluoride strongly inhibits photosynthesis and other processes. It will move in the transpiration stream from roots or through stomata and accumulate in leaf margins. Excessive drying between waterings also can lead to brown tips and margins, especially if fertilized too much.
A wide variety of plants are sensitive to fluoride toxicity. Typical indoor foliage plants include Dracaena, Tahitian Bridal Veil (Gibasis pellucida) and the spider plant (Chlorophytum comosum). Sensitive flowering plants include gladiolus, lily, tulip and yucca.


","Tips or margins of leaves turn brown and necrotic.

Eggplant ,(Solanum melongena)-Verticillium Wilt,"Verticillium dahliae, a fungus widespread in soil and that affects a wide range of herbaceous and woody plants. Once V. dahliae makes it way into a soil, the microsclerotia it produces in affected plant tissues can survive for a number of years in soil. It can also be seedborne in eggplant but not likely to be important in the overall disease cycle. Asymptomatic weedy hosts can also perpetuate the pathogen population. The fungus gains entry through the root system; progress in the plant is primarily through the vascular system. This species can cause disease in cooler soils and survives as resistant mycelium as it does not produce microsclerotia. Plant parasitic nematodes in the presence of Verticillium can result in severe disease.


","Infected plants are stunted, and leaves yellow and roll inward. Disease development on eggplant begins with a yellowing of the lower leaves, wilting, reduced growth, and vascular discoloration.

Elm ,(Ulmus spp.)-Bacterial Wetwood,"Wetwood is associated with bacteria including Enterobacter nimipressuralis, Bacillus megaterium, and Pseudomonas sp. Liquid accumulates in diseased tissue of the tree which is then colonized by the bacteria. Anaerobic growth of the bacteria produces gas inside the tree. The high gas pressure forces liquid out of the tree where it dries on the bark. A higher pH also can be detected in diseased tissue. Wetwood has been observed in elm, willow, and locust especially in eastern and southern Oregon.


","Wetwood can be in all parts of the tree but is not obvious in xylem tissue less than 10 years old. Trunks show a circular dark brown discoloration of the wood in cross-section. When freshly cut, wood appears water soaked. In large limbs, the central core is discolored. Wilting twigs and branches show discoloration out to the sapwood.
Wetwood also is associated with wounds. Liquid forced out by internal pressure exits near wounds or high-angled branch crotches and drips down the trunk. This liquid is at first colorless to light yellow but turns brown when exposed to air. Light gray to white streaks stain the outside bark below these areas.


","No controls are known to avoid initiation or development of wetwood. Installing metal or plastic drain tubes to release pressure and drain excess liquid away is not recommended. The tubes are thought to help spread wetwood to uninfected areas, bypassing the tree's normal defense mechanisms. Draining the fluid also is thought to increase the likelihood of fungal decay.

Elm ,(Ulmus spp.)-Dutch Elm Disease,"Ophiostoma ulmi (formerly Ceratocystis ulmi) and O. novo-ulmi, fungi with many subgroups. The first of two North American epidemics began in the 1920s with the introduction of a relatively non-aggressive subgroup, which reduced the native elm population. A second, more destructive epidemic began in the 1940s with the introduction of a more aggressive subgroup, which has been found in Oregon.
Diseased trees were first found in the Pacific Northwest in Boise, ID in 1968. The next reports were from Ontario, OR in 1973 and La Grande and Union, OR in 1974. A single tree was found in Portland, OR in 1976 and was removed promptly. No other trees were identified until a new outbreak in Eugene and Portland, OR in 1986. Since then, additional Oregon locations include Hillsboro in 1987, Salem in 1988, Corvallis in 1995, Heppner in 1999, Pendleton in 2000, and Medford in 2006. Most of the diseased trees have been from the Portland area. The disease continued its spread with reports from Moscow and Weiser, ID and Spokane, WA in 1990 and Tacoma and Bellevue, WA in 1994. The disease has continued to spread into the greater Seattle area. As of 2008 it has not been found in British Columbia.
The disease is spread by several bark beetles, the most important of which is the smaller European elm bark beetle (Scolytus multistriatus). These bark beetles breed in diseased trees but feed on healthy ones.
The fungus produces spores (Graphium type) in beetle galleries beneath the bark of dead or dying wood. Spores on or in the beetle's body can be carried to and infect healthy trees during feeding. Beetles overwinter as larvae under the bark of unhealthy or injured trees or cut logs. In spring, larvae complete their growth, pupate, and change into adult beetles. The adult flies a short distance and feeds on the bark of small branches of living elms (beetles are active from mid-May to early October). After feeding in the canopy of healthy trees, adults seek breeding sites under the bark of dead or weakened trees or logs. They bore through the bark and into the cambium area to lay eggs.
Spores in the feeding site grow into the tree's vascular system. The mycelium continues to invade the vascular system, forming new spores (Sporothrix type) and toxins that clog the xylem and kill living cells. The result is a wilting and dying of the tree distal to the areas the fungus invaded. Trees are most susceptible in spring, during shoot elongation. The entire tree may die in a few weeks or take a year depending on how rapidly the fungus progresses down to the roots.
When elms grow within 40 ft of each other, their roots often cross and form natural grafts. The fungus in the vascular system of one tree can invade the adjoining tree through the graft.
Many elm species are highly susceptible to the disease including American, Belgian, English, red, rock, September, European white, and winged elms. Intermediately susceptible are cedar, European field, and wych elms. Chinese, Japanese, and Siberian elms have resistance. Oregon continues to quarantine all Ulmus, Zelkova and Planera spp., which must be certified free of Dutch elm disease (and elm yellows) before entering the state.


","Early symptoms are wilting leaves and sparse foliage, first on single limbs but later the entire tree may be affected. Yellowing and premature defoliation follow. Symptoms may show only a few days after infection has occurred. If infection is high in the tree and late in the year, disease progress may be slow. If main limbs are infected through lower branches in spring, progress may be rapid, and the tree can wilt and die in a short time. These symptoms may be confused with other vascular wilt diseases or summer heat stress.
Infected sapwood shows brown streaking especially in its current-season growth. A cross-section often shows either a broken or continuous brown ring in outer growth rings.


","Many methods must be integrated to manage this disease. Prompt sanitation is the primary way to prevent disease.

1) The best approach for susceptible trees is to  detect and remove diseased trees. Communities without the disease or with low disease incidence should map all susceptible trees and regularly scout them for symptoms of Dutch elm disease.

2) Trees with 25% or more of the crown showing symptoms cannot be saved. Trees infected via root grafts cannot be saved, either. Detailed pruning may save trees at the earliest stage of the disease. Limbs must be cut well below (several feet) discolored cambial tissue soon after a positive diagnosis.

3) Remove and burn all dead wood and branches before beetles emerge in spring. This includes branches weakened by storm damage, drought, etc. Pruning is best done during the dormant season. Remove the bark if branches cannot be disposed of quickly because the bark beetles can complete their life cycle only in logs with bark intact. Even small patches are enough for the beetles to complete their life cycle. Do not save branches or logs for firewood unless bark is completely removed.

4) Protect trees within 25 to 50 ft by severing root grafts with a mechanical trencher. Do this before removing adjacent, diseased trees.

5) Grind stumps of removed trees, or remove the bark below the soil surface.

6) Plant resistant elm species or hybrids including American Liberty clones, 'Cathedral', 'Delaware', 'Frontier', 'Homestead', 'Independence', 'New Harmony', 'New Horizon', 'Patriot', 'Pioneer', 'Regal', 'Sapporo Autumn Gold', and 'Valley Forge'. Many of these are also reported to be resistant to elm leaf beetle.

7) Maintain tree vigor and health through proper management during the growing season. This may include watering or protection from nearby construction.

8) Avoid developing gardens (rototilling, etc.) directly under trees.

","Use only when integrated with cultural controls. Trunk injections are least effective and must be repeated over the life of the tree (possibly every other year). Injections are recommended only for extremely high value trees. Preventive treatments are much more effective than therapeutic treatments. Hole placement is critical for uptake and complete tree coverage. Generally, make small, shallow holes close to the ground on the root flares. Rates are based on trunk diameter. See labels for details.


1) Alamo at 6 to 10 ml per injection site for each inch of tree diameter at breast height (DBH). There is concern about possible phytotoxicity to the cambium of injected trees. Group 3 fungicide.

2) Arbotect 20-S at 1 to 2 fl oz/5 inches trunk diameter annually or at 12 fl oz/6 gal water/5 inches trunk diameter every 3 years but only if trees are greater than 10 inches in diameter. This active ingredient has been used successfully for many years both as a preventative and therapeutically. 0-hr reentry.

3) Fungisol has had variable results, which may have been to due to rate differences. 0-hr reentry.

4) Phyton 27 is not recommended because it is difficult to get into the trees, is phytotoxic to the cambium around injection sites and has not shown significant control.

","Injecting Verticillium albo-atrum WCS850 into trees has been effective at limiting new infections but must be repeated annually. This treatment will not control infections that arrive through root grafts. There are no commercial formulations.


"
Elm ,(Ulmus spp.)-Nectria Canker,"Nectria cinnabarina, a fungus. It is a common saprophyte on many plant species. The fungus colonizes bark, cambium, and sapwood of stems weakened by freezing, drought, mechanical injury, or other diseases.


","Twigs and branches die back from cankers. Bark of the canker area may be discolored and contain small coral-pink to black fungus fruiting bodies (perithecia). The disease may follow winter injury, drought, or insect injury. Leaves on affected branches often are dwarfed or wilt later in the season.


","

1) Prune out and burn dead twigs and branches. Make cuts several inches below any sign of infection. Paint large wounds with a tree dressing.

2) When pruning, do not leave stubs or make flush cuts up against the branch or trunk.

3) Avoid bark injury from mowing or other practices.

4) Fertilize and water to maintain tree vigor.

After infection, the microorganism spreads mainly in the inner bark tissues of the root and stems. Several spores can persist for several years. Movement of infected plants and/or soil can spread the organism.


","Leaves may turn grayish and/or the entire top of the plant wilts. The vascular cambium becomes dark or cinnamon-brown and there may be a sharp line between diseases and healthy root tissue.

Euonymus,Bacterial Blight,"Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae, a bacterium. Factors that favor the disease include wounds, frost damage, soil pH, poor nutrition, and infection by other pathogens. Sources of bacteria include old cankers, healthy buds, and epiphytes on leaf surfaces, weeds, grasses, and even soil. Bacteria can spread by wind, rain, insects, and infected nursery stock. Two common genetic traits increase the bacteria's ability to cause disease. Most produce a powerful plant toxin, syringomycin, which destroys plant tissues as bacteria multiply in a wound. Bacteria also produce a protein that acts as an ice nucleus, increasing frost wounds that bacteria easily colonize and expand.


","Only black-tip or shoot dieback has been reported on Euonymus, but workers in Oregon also have associated leaf spots with this bacterium.

Euonymus,Crown Gall,"Rhizobium radiobacter (formerly Agrobacterium tumefaciens), a soilborne bacterium, enters Euonymus plants through wounds, either natural or caused by pruning, grafting, mechanical injury from cultivation, heaving of frozen soils, chewing insects, or the emergence of lateral roots. After the bacterium enters a wound, a small piece of its DNA is transferred into the plant's DNA. The foreign DNA transforms normal plant cells in the wounded area into tumor cells. Once transformed, tumor cells proliferate automatically. The result is a gall, a disorganized mass of hyperplastic and hypertrophic tissue.


","Large, fleshy galls occur on roots and anywhere along aerial shoots and branches. These aboveground galls are white to greenish at first and firm like cauliflower but become hard and dark brown with age. Infected plants may be stunted, lack normal green color, and die back during severe winters. Symptoms may not develop for over a year if infection occurs when temperatures are below 59°F.

These fungi can move short distances from tree to tree via root-to-root contact or root grafts. Long distance spread is by a root-feeding bark beetle and two root and crown weevils. Insects breed in the dying roots of stressed trees even before crown symptoms are observed. Although neither is necessary for the other, if insects breed in an infected root system they can spread the fungus to new trees that do not have the disease. Generally found next to roads, in plantations that have been thinned and that have suffered severe soil disturbance during the harvest of the previous stand and in areas of disturbed soil drainage.


","Old needles are lost first followed by reduced terminal growth, chlorosis and sometimes a crop of stress cones before tree death. The black stain can be seen in the wood as broad streaks extending from the roots up the stem. In cross section it appears in crescents and follows the annual rings. Generally limited to one to three growth rings. Wood decay does not occur unless other fungi are present. The staining may fade once the tree dies. Basal resinosis or pitching (large exudations of pitch at the base of the stem at or below the root collar) may also occur.

Ascospores are released in spring at the same time as the unfolding of new shoots. Infection occurs mainly on these new needles but may occur later with continued wet weather. Greatest losses result from the trees' unsightliness, which renders them unsalable.

Trees from the Cibola National Forest (NF) are very susceptible while trees from the Apache NF, San Isabel NF, Lincoln NF and Santa Fe NF have intermediate susceptibility. Trees from the Carson NF, Coconino NF, Rio Grande NF and Upper Clearwater, Idaho have much less disease development.


","The first evidence of the disease appears in the autumn or early winter as minute yellow spots on upper and lower surfaces of current-year needles. Usually, spots are more abundant near the needle's apex. Spots become larger and darker during winter. By spring, many spots coalesce and become deep red-brown with a mottled appearance. Fruiting bodies (apothecia) of the fungus appear on each side of the midrib on the needle's lower surface. The needle's epidermis lifts up as a patch, exposing an orange to orange-brown fungus structure. Infected needles fall off by late June.

"Fir, Douglas ","(Pseudotsuga menziesii)-Needle Cast, Swiss","Phaeocryptopus gaeumannii, a fungus found on trees of all age classes from natural forests to ornamental landscapes. Mortality is rare, but premature loss of foliage reduces growth in forest plantations, as well as in Christmas trees and in nursery stock, so that this disease can impact aesthetics, crown fullness and color, and overall tree health. The most important problem is on Christmas trees where needle quantity and quality determines saleability. The disease probably is native to the Pacific Coast but was first described in Switzerland, hence the name Swiss needle cast. Douglas-fir is the only known conifer host.
The disease became a forest problem during the 1990s in the coastal-fog zones of the northern coast range of Oregon where Douglas-fir has been planted beyond its normal range. Native and naturally regenerated stands also have severe disease development. The most heavily infected areas are around Tillamook County, Oregon up to 24 miles from the ocean. Forests from Bandon, OR to the Northern Olympic Peninsula of WA have symptoms visible from aerial surveys. Hazard zone research has shown that variables associated with increased moisture (such as fog, rainfall, and altitude), warm conditions (such as temperature during the winter), and lack of excessive heat in the summer correlate with higher disease severity. The disease is estimated to reduce mean volume growth in severe situations by 23% to 52%.
Spores produced in spring infect through the stomata of young, rapidly expanding shoots. Cool, rainy weather in spring is conducive to disease development. Symptoms and fruiting bodies of the fungus (pseudothecia) are not produced until the next spring. Production of pseudothecia was related to winter mean daily temperature and spring cumulative leaf wetness. The fungus appears to live as an endophyte within the needle and only causes disease when pseudothecia clog stomates on the underside of the needle. Needles are typically lost after 25% of the stomates are plugged.


","Infected needles usually turn off-color (light green to yellow to brown) and are prematurely cast in early spring. Needles may yellow only at the tips or be generally speckled yellow over the entire length. Current-year needles do not show symptoms. Some trees will retain infected needles and show no symptoms. Diagnostic signs are rows of black pseudothecia (pinpoint-size fruiting structures) on each side of the midrib on the lower needle surface. A hand lens is helpful in distinguishing these structures from sooty mold. Pseudothecia are most prevalent on needles 1 year old and older. Severely infected trees have only current-year needles. When displayed indoors as Christmas trees, infected trees dry out twice as fast as healthy ones.
The forestry problem, sometimes referred to as Tillamook decline, is characterized by chlorotic needles, low needle retention, and poor height and diameter growth. Trees with severe disease had narrower sapwood, narrower growth rings, higher modulus of elasticity, higher wood density, greater proportion of latewood, and lower sapwood moisture content.
Diagnosis solely based on visual symptoms is not able to distinguish Swiss needle cast from needle casts due to Phytophthora pluvialis.


","Silvicultural techniques, such as thinning and vegetation management, have been shown to have no impact on disease severity on forest trees, but will influence stand development and individual tree growth. Cultural tactics combined with chemical management are effective in Christmas tree and nursery settings.

1) Avoid planting in low-lying areas with poor air drainage.

2) Space plants for good air circulation.

3) Control weeds around the bases of trees.

4) Avoid seed from susceptible trees.

5) In heavily diseased areas, plant new forest plantations with species other than Douglas-fir.

6) Although not tested, increase rotation lengths to accommodate for growth losses that peak when stands are in the 10- to 30-years-old range.

","Fungicides are not needed the first few years a Christmas tree is in the ground. Begin spraying 3 years before harvest. If needed, apply once when new spring growth is 1 to 2 inches long. Considering normal spring weather in the Pacific Northwest, it is better to apply fungicides a little early than too late. Although effective, the environmental and economic costs are too high for fungicides to be used in the forest setting.

"Fir, Douglas ",(Pseudotsuga menziesii)-Rust,"The fungus Melampsora occidentalis is the most common cause of needle rust in the Pacific Northwest. The alternate host is black cottonwood and other poplars. The aecial stage is found on the current-year needles. Urediniospores and teliospores are on the alternate host, poplar.


","Yellow pustules in late spring or early summer on the lower needle surface. The area above the pustule, on the upper surface, becomes light green.

Cankers are most often found on trees that are not vigorous or are weak from drought or winter injury, typically 1 to 2 years after the stress. Infections are on new shoots from windblown spores. Mechanical injuries can also be sites for new infections. Dermea boycei has been generally found on young trees of Douglas-fir and grand fir.


","The sunken Dermea cankers are elliptical and vary in size. Larger cankers can be up to 30 inches long. They develop through the dormant season. Branches and stems can be attacked. When the canker has girdled the stem or branch, the portion above is killed. Tiny black pycnidia appear on sunken cankers in the bark.
Symptoms of Phomopsis canker were mainly dieback in the upper crown and stem cankers at the bases of killed branches. Dieback can be as much as 15 to 20 ft. Small regeneration trees can also be top-killed. During the winter, lesions up to 6 ft in length and 1 to 2 inches wide develop downward from the killed top.

If needles appear yellow with a drab green midrib, blotches may have merged or coalesced. All variations of needle symptoms may appear on the tree at the same time. Affected needles generally fall off and can cause defoliation in severe cases. Affected trees usually are scattered within a plantation; the disease does not seem to spread within the plantation.

"Fir, Douglas and True",Armillaria Root Rot,,"This disease is characterized by thin and/or chlorotic foliage, distress cone crops, abundant resin flow or leaching of brown liquid at tree bases (basal resinosis) and tree death. Trees tend to die standing but may be wind thrown. Tree with lesion types that expand more vertically tend to survive and live longer than trees with lesion types that expand horizontally. Bark beetles may hasten tree decline and death. A yellow-stringy root and butt rot is common in non-resinous conifers such as hemlock. Diagnostic mycelial fans can be observed beneath the bark of the root crown of infected plants. Dig down about a foot below the soil line and use a pocketknife to remove thin layers of bark from the root collar. Mycelial fans are thick, white layers of fungus that adhere to the inner root bark and/or the wood beneath the bark. Armillaria also makes black, shoestring-like structures called rhizomorphs, which are occasionally found within the bark and/or extending into surrounding soil. Rhizomorphs may look like roots on the outside but have an entirely different structure when cut open in cross-section.


","

1) Know where disease centers are likely to develop through historical records.

2) Use seed sources adapted to the area. Supplement plantings using seeds that germinate on site.

3) Favor resistant tree species by thinning mixed conifer stands.

4) Cut trees out of infection centers plus a buffer of healthy appearing trees and establish resistant tree species.

5) Avoid frequent salvage cuts in stands with known infection centers.

6) Excavation of infected stumps can be considered where terrain, soil type and economics permit. Burn or let stumps air dry.

"Fir, Douglas and True",Damping-off,"Several soilborne fungi including Fusarium, Pythium and Rhizoctonia species have been reported to cause damping-off. Fusarium and Pythium species are the most common. In most container and bareroot nurseries, Fusarium is ubiquitous in nursery soils, on seeds of several conifer species, and on healthy and diseased conifer seedlings, especially Douglas-fir, western white pine (Pinus monticola), and ponderosa pine. Fusarium commune, however, is the primary species of Fusarium associated with root disease in conifers.
Approximately 20 species of Pythium have been found in forest nursery soils and eight species, including P. dissotocum, P. irregulare, P. mamillatum, P. sylvaticum, and P. ultimum, are aggressive pathogens of tree seedlings causeing extensive Douglas-fir seedling mortality.
Diseases caused by Fusarium and Pythium are generally more serious in bareroot nurseries than in greenhouse container nurseries, where contamination of growing media, temperature, and irrigation are controlled more easily. However, these fungi can become a problem if growing media become contaminated or a pathogen is introduced on seeds or in irrigation water. These fungi are able to survive for various periods as resting spores or as mycelium in soil and residual host tissues, and they can be seedborne. They also can persist in styroblocks and other containers.
Seedlings are infected when favorable soil moisture and temperature conditions and seed or root exudates are present. Pythium produces a motile spore (zoospore), which can readily spread in water film to infect roots. Infection typically occurs early in the growing season when soils are still moist and cool and seedling tissues are young. Fusarium species may be seedborne and can cause pre- and post-emergence damping-off as well as hypocotyl rot and root rot later in the growing season. Cool soil and improper planting depth, with slow germination and emergence rates, favor disease development.
The practice of tilling in ""green manure"" cover crops can aggravate disease problems by providing high levels of organic matter that result in increased pathogen levels. A bare fallow rotation instead of cover crop can significantly reduce pathogens and improve fumigation efficacy.


","Seedlings' fail to emerge from soil or rapidly wilt shortly after emergence. Seeds may rot before they germinate (preemergence damping-off).


","

1) Avoid poorly drained soil.

2) Use seeds that are properly conditioned.

3) Rotate planting beds with nonsusceptible hosts such as small grains to reduce fungal inoculum levels. Avoid legume cover crops. Keeping beds weed free and fallow with periodic tilling during inter-rotational seasons is even better.

4) Designate separate isolation beds for growing nursery stock that arrives from other nurseries.

5) Do not reuse planting containers, or thoroughly wash and disinfect them if they are reused. Sanitizing styroblocks by heat, fungicide, or biocide treatment can help control disease problems. Discard older styroblocks because after multiple uses sanitation efficacy is reduced.

6) Use well water or filter and/or decontaminate surface water used for irrigation. Irrigate only enough to thoroughly wet the root zone. Water as needed based on water use of the seedlings.

7) Plant when soil temperature is warm enough to promote rapid germination and emergence.

8) Soil pH between 5.2 and 5.7 is ideal for most Pacific Northwest conifers.

9) Clean equipment before being shared or exchanged between nurseries.

"Fir, Douglas and True",Dwarf Mistletoe,"Several Arceuthobium spp., parasitic plants, attack important forest species in the PNW. Dwarf mistletoe is an important disease of Douglas-fir (attacked by Arceuthobium douglasii) in southern and eastern Oregon. Arceuthobium douglasii has also been found occasionally on Pacific silver fir and rarely on grand fir and subalpine fir. These mistletoes do not attack oak or other hardwoods.
Dwarf mistletoe also attacks true firs. A. abietinum f. sp. concoloris infects mostly grand fir and rarely Pacific fir and subalpine fir. It has been found east of the Cascade Range and in southwest Oregon but rarely in the Willamette Valley. A. tsugense ssp. amabilae infects noble fir, Pacific fir, mountain hemlock and subalpine fir; occasionally western hemlock and rarely grand fir and western white pine. It has been found on the Cascade Crest from Mt. Hood to the Umpqua River.
Dwarf mistletoes can also be found on ponderosa pine (attacked by A. campylopodum), lodgepole pine (attacked by A. americanum), and western hemlock (attacked by A. tsugense) in much of their native ranges. Western larch can be seriously damaged by A. laricis east of the Cascade Range in the Blue and Wallowa Mountains.
Fruit explodes when mature, dispersing seeds several feet away. Needles of the host tree intercept seeds. Rain then washes seeds down to twigs where germination and penetration occur. Once infection is established, there is an incubation period of 2 to 5 years before young shoots appear. A swelling at the point of infection usually precedes shoot production by a year or more. Pollen from male plants fertilize flowers on female plants, which produce the fruit after several months' development.
They retard the growth of infected trees and cause extensive timber losses through direct and indirect mortality. Host seed production and wood quality can also be reduced. Decay fungi may gain entrance at the site of the mistletoe attachment.


","Small (0.75 to 4 inches) yellowish-green plants growing in clusters on branches. In Douglas-fir, mistletoe plants appear scattered along slender branches of usually dense, large brooms. However, only one mistletoe plant may be present since its aerial shoots arise from an internal systemic infection. In other tree species, plant clusters arise from spindle-shaped swellings. Witches' brooms of great variety form on all hosts.
Occasionally large brooms may form on Douglas-fir with no apparent cause. Large growths of shortened shoots occur in a dense cluster on branches.


","

1) Remove all plants by harvesting or pruning. This is easiest in mid- or late summer when plants are most easily seen. Aerial shoots will re-grow unless the entire host branch is removed.

2) Forestry:

2.1) Clear-cut severely infected stands.
2.2) Remove infested overstory if a manageable susceptible understory is present.
2.3) Favor non-hosts in mixed stands.

","Fusarium hypocotyl rot occurs as sporadic death of emerged seedlings in seedbeds, especially during warm weather. There is a characteristic browning of the stem just below the cotyledons. Fusarium root rot shows as sporadic, patchy death of seedlings in seedbeds. The disease is associated with warm weather and has been called ""fourth of July disease."" Affected seedlings are reddish brown and typically bent over in a ""shepherd's crook."" Roots are poorly developed.
Phytophthora root rot in 1+0 seedlings occurs as reddish brown discolored roots. Aboveground symptoms occur in the szpring of the second year and include patchy chlorosis, browning, and mortality in low, poorly drained beds. Roots initially are discolored and eventually rot off completely. A characteristic dark brown stain in the root cambium, often with a distinct margin between healthy tissue above and diseased tissue below, is diagnostic.
Pythium-infected seedlings have stem tissue that separates around the root collar where the epidermis sloughs away from the inner xylem. Fusarium-infected seedlings undergo a softening of the root collar tissue, and the trees fall over without separation of the stem tissues.

","Several biocontrol formulations have been tested for efficacy in preventing or treating damping-off and root diseases in conifer nurseries, but so far none has proved effective.


"
"Fir, Douglas and True",Laminated Root Rot,"Phellinidium weirii (formerly Phellinus weirii), a fungus (may also be called P. sulphurascens in some reports). This native root pathogen is often found in forested areas, in large old tree stumps where it can live several decades as a saprophyte. Infection spreads from tree to tree through the stand and from stumps to roots of healthy seedlings or trees that contact infected wood. Root infections eventually lead to root and lower bole decay; the tree dies directly or as a result of windthrow. This is the most serious disease of older Douglas-fir and true fir. Bark beetles are often present in trees with P. weirii infections.


","Crown symptoms may not become noticeable until 50% or more of the roots system has been destroyed. Reduced terminal growth is usually the first crown symptom. In the later stages of root infection, affected trees show crown yellowing as well as reduced terminal and lateral branch growth. Basal resinosis or pitching (large exudations of pitch at the base of the stem at or below the root collar) may also occur. Decay appears as reddish-brown-to-chocolate-brown irregular patches or crescent-shaped stains, usually in the heartwood, on fresh cut stump, or root cross sections. Short oval pit then appear and become more numerous. Diseased trees often fall over because most roots have decayed. Pathogen mycelium often covers infected roots. Decayed roots separate at the annual rings like pages in a book; hence the common name laminated root rot. Microscopic brown fungal hairs called setal hyphae, which are diagnostic for this fungus, often cover the laminated rot. Flattened conks develop on the undersides of roots or logs.


","

1) Avoid building near centers of root-rot infection. Construction activity usually worsens the situation and can lead to tree failures and property loss.

2) Remove healthy appearing trees that are next to confirmed infected trees in the landscape, as these are likely to be infected as well. This will reduce root-to-root spread to other trees that are not yet infected.

3) In mixed-species areas, favor resistant species such as cedar, pine, or hardwoods when planting, thinning, or harvesting.

4) Excavating infected stumps has helped on industrial land.

5) Thin stands to decrease root contacts.

"Fir, Douglas and True",Ramorum Shoot Dieback,,"Symptoms associated with Phytophthora ramorum infections include needle blight, a shoot blight resulting from needle infections, and stem lesions resulting from the growth of the pathogen from infected newly emerging needles/shoots into older wood. Symptoms are similar to Botrytis shoot blight on young seedlings. Douglas-fir and grand fir are on the hosts and associated hosts lists, respectively.


",,,
"Fir, Douglas and True-Stem Decays ",(Heart Rots),"Stem decay in living trees is caused by various fungi that enter trees through wounds or small branches. Decay fungi usually do not kill trees but trees, which are affected, are structurally weakened and more likely to break during storms or harvest. Decayed trees can be a serious hazard when near roads, buildings or developed recreation areas. Decay in living trees can also provide important wildlife habitat. Many different trees have decay problems; however, non-resinous species such as true firs, hemlocks and hardwoods have more decay than resinous species such as Douglas-fir, pines and larch.
Wounds can activate dormant infections and provide openings for spores to create new infections. Basal wounds generally have more decay than upper stem wounds. Older trees tend to have more decay as well. Living trees will actively compartmentalize decay columns limiting the amount within the stem. If you see a fungal conk on the trunk of a tree, the rule of thumb is that the decay column or cull factor is about 8 feet below (and/or above) the fruiting body.
Brown Trunk Rot - Fomitopsis officinalis (sometimes called the quinine fungus) - is a problem on Douglas-fir, pine and larch.
Red Ring Rot (sometimes called white speck) - Porodaedalea pini (formerly Phellinus pini) - is a problem on Douglas-fir, grand fir, white fir, mountain hemlock and pine.
Rosey Top Rot - Fomitopsis cajanderi - is a problem on many conifers that have storm damage and top breakage. This fungus and others colonize the damaged tissue.
Rust-red Stringy White Rot - Echinodontium tinctorium (sometimes called Indian paint fungus) - is a problem on true firs and mountain hemlock.
Schweinitzii Root and Butt Rot - Phaeolus schweinitzii (sometimes call the cow pie fungus) - is a problem on Douglas-fir, true firs, pine, larch and spruce.


","
Brown Trunk Rot - Brown cubical decay with white mycelial felts. Large, white to gray conks may develop on the stem.
Red Ring Rot - Initially there is a red stain in a ring when viewed in cross section. Then white, spindle-shaped pockets of decay (white specks) develop parallel to the wood grain. Wood may have a honeycombed appearance in advanced stages of decay. The decay column may extend several feet above or below a conk. Bracket-like gray to brown conks with golden-brown angular pores on the underside may be seen on the stem.
Rosey Top Rot - Brown cubical decay with white to faintly rose-colored mycelial felts. The rose-colored pore layer of fruiting bodies is distinctive for this disease.
Rust-red Stringy White Rot - Brown to reddish orange rot of the heartwood. The wood becomes stringy and eventually takes on a whitish cast in advanced stages of decay. Bright orange rusty pink knots may protrude from the bark and are a good indicator of the fungus. Large, black, hoof-shaped conks with red interior and ""teeth"" on the underside may be seen underneath dead branch stubs.
Schweinitzii Root and Butt Rot - Brown cubical decay. Large yellow to brown conk with soft velvet top develop on the stem. Conk has a short stalk when growing on the ground (and looks like a cow pie) but is bracket-like when growing on a tree. Basal resinosis or pitching (large exudations of pitch at the base of the stem at or below the root collar) may also occur.


","The primary management tactic is to prevent tree wounds.

1) Avoid spring and early summer logging, when bark is soft and loose.

2) Mark ""leave"" trees rather than trees to be cut so that leave trees are easier to distinguish.

3) Plan and mark skid trails before logging.

4) Log skid trails first. Then limb and top trees before skidding.

5) Use directional falling and fell to openings.

6) Remove slash within 10 feet of ""leave"" trees to reduce damage from natural or prescribed fires.

7) If snags and decayed trees are desired, top trees just below the live crown, make hollows or slits at least 25 feet above the ground, or drill 1-inch diameter holes into the trunk at least 6-inches deep. A piece of plastic pipe in the hole will prevent the hole from being sealed with pitch or callus.

"Fir, Douglas and True",Web Blight,"A binucleate Rhizoctonia-like fungus, but not the same one that causes root rot or damping-off of seedlings. The disease affects grand, noble, and Douglas-fir. Some studies have shown balsam fir, western hemlock and Sitka spruce may also be susceptible. The disease is worse in Christmas tree plantations with restricted air flow, close tree spacing, and dense foliage. Although the Rhizoctonia-like fungus can infect needles of all ages, new infections are typically seen only on current year needles. This needle blight has been found in native Douglas-fir trees bordering Christmas tree plantations. The disease has been found only in the mid-Willamette Valley of Oregon.


","The disease usually is first noticed as browning of outer foliage in a roughly circular area. Browned areas can be anywhere on the tree but most often are on lower branches. Affected needles turn brown without any associated yellowing or banding. Needles hang down and stay attached to the branches long after they have died. Under moist conditions, fine fungal webbing may be visible, binding together the discolored needles. Buds and twigs of grand fir are killed but not those of Douglas-fir. The disease, which can spread to affect as much as half the side of a tree, can be distinguished from Botrytis (gray mold) in that the latter affects only current-year needles and shoots.


","

1) Avoid planting in low-lying areas with poor air drainage.

2) Space plants for good air circulation.

3) Avoid planting near native stands of Douglas-fir that appear to have this disease.

4) Control weeds around the bases of trees to improve air circulation.

5) Pruning low in trees that have the disease only in the lower branches may allow harvest at some future date.

6) Scout trees before the first shearing of the year. Look for areas of dead needles on the periphery of the tree. Remove and destroy affected trees.

"Fir, True ",(Abies spp.)-Annosus Root Disease,"Heterobasidion occidentale, a fungus. This native soil pathogen is often in large old tree stumps. It can live several decades as a saprophyte on stumps and roots. Infection is mainly from airborne spores produced by conks on or in old stump hollows. Spores infect freshly cut stump surfaces or trunk wounds. Cut stumps are susceptible only for a short period of time. Infection spreads from stumps to roots of healthy seedlings or trees that contact infected wood. Root infections may lead to root and lower bole decay; the tree dies directly or as a result of windthrow. Trunk infections lead to stem decay. Bark beetles also often infest infected trees.
The disease can be found in forests, ornamental plantings, and Christmas tree plantations where true fir has been partially harvested. New trees planted between the stumps of old infected trees are especially likely to get the disease. More root disease has been found when land has been planted for the second or third time (rotation) to Christmas trees. Pockets of this disease increase in plantations where the disease goes unnoticed and/or untreated. It also can be a problem in stump-cultured Christmas trees, which are cut high and in which a lower branch is then trained into a new tree.
Host range of this fungus includes 150 conifer and angiosperm trees. The disease is especially troublesome on ponderosa and lodgepole pines in southern Oregon, often on drier sites, resulting in tree mortality. This fungus is also a serious wound decay pathogen and butt rotter especially in coastal spruce/hemlock forests and high elevation true fir stands. The disease can be found on Douglas-fir but is consider more of an oddity. Urea in an aqueous solution of 20% or higher has been effective as a fresh stump protectant on pine but more variable on spruce and other tree species.


","In the later stages of root infection, affected trees show crown yellowing and reduced terminal and lateral branch growth. These are general symptoms and can be confused with any other root rot problem. Infected roots may be covered by mycelium of the pathogen, but most often no mycelium or conks are present. Decayed wood may be laminated or stringy with black flecks. Seedlings can begin to die a few years after planting. Diseased trees may occur in pockets in the field.
There may be no aboveground symptoms before Christmas tree harvest. However, a dark staining of the older wood may be evident on the cut surface.


","

1) Monitor for staining in the older wood of recently cut trees that may indicate a problem in one or more fields.

2) Stumps should be excavated between rotations to prevent spread especially when the disease has been found within the plantation.

3) Remove and destroy infected trees and root systems if possible.

4) In mixed-species areas, favor resistant species such as cedar, pine, or hardwoods when planting, thinning, or harvesting. Nordmann fir also has been found to be resistant.

5) Avoid wounding tree roots and trunks.

6) The use of dirt to cover freshly cut stumps has been suggested but has only worked in 2 of 3 tests.

","Treat freshly cut stumps with a surface protectant. This is important in plantations that do not yet show evidence of the disease.

"Fir, True ",(Abies spp.)-Black Mildew,"Rasutoria abietis is a fungus that can grow only as a parasite on needles of grand, white, and alpine fir. It cannot grow on dead needles. Generally, it affects the foliage of young trees in dense shade or very humid sites. The fungus reproduces by ascospores produced in pseudothecia. Although unsightly, the affected foliage can tolerate the fungus, which rarely causes severe injury. The disease is not considered economically important.


","Dark patches or mats of dark hyphae on lower needle surfaces and, sometimes, on green twigs. Superficial hyphae penetrate the needles through the stomata and form clusters of perithecia on the needles' undersides. Affected needles may yellow and have a conspicuous splotchy appearance. Older needles may discolor and be cast prematurely.

"Fir, True ",(Abies spp.)-Broom Rust,"The fungus Melampsorella caryophyllacearum causes large brooms on true firs (Abies sp) including A. concolor (white fir), A. magnifica (Calif. Red fir) A. amabilis (Cascade fir), A. balsamea (balsam fir), A. grandis (grand fir), and A. lasiocarpa (alpine fir). The disease is found throughout the Pacific Northwest. The main problem is growth loss rather than poor wood quality. The disease is considered a forestry problem only in the Northern Rockies and in parts of California. Aeciospores are produced yearly on the fir host while uredinia and telia are produced on the chickweed (Cerastium sp. and Stellaria sp.) alternate host. Basidiospores from chickweed infect fir buds (leaves and new bark) as they open in the spring. Branches remain symptomless until the following spring when infected shoots emerge. The aecia develop and shed spores to chickweed in the summer. Uredinia develop within a few weeks of infection and continue to infect healthy plants and plant parts through the rest of the growing season. Telia develop in the fall and shed spores the next spring during fir bud break. The fungus can be systemic in perennial chickweeds.


","The first symptom may be an elongate swelling of the infected branch in the fall after spring infection. The spring after infection, infected shoots emerge, which are thicker and shorter than normal shoots. These shoots grow vertically from the infected branch, are pale yellow and very conspicuous in the summer. Needles on these shoots are short and thickened as well. Rust pustules (aecia) develop on the leaves. Leaves fall prematurely in August. Infected shoots continue to develop and branch yearly resulting in large brooms. Unlike brooms due to dwarf mistletoe, brooms bear yellow needles that die and drop in the fall making the broom appear bare and dead. The infected branch becomes swollen at the base of the broom into a spindle-shaped or sometimes nearly spherical gall.


","

1) Remove brooms well below the swollen part of the branch.

2) Remove trees with main stem infections early in the life of the stand.

3) Chickweed eradication may be useful in the vicinity of high valued trees.

"Fir, True ",(Abies spp.)-Current-season Needle Necrosis,"Unknown. A physiological disorder that affects needles of noble and grand fir. It has become one of the most common needle diseases on these trees in the Pacific Northwest. There are site differences as well as considerable genetic variation among different sources of noble fir for development of this problem. Growers have noted the problem is not as great at higher elevations and in natural stands. Having the problem on more than 10% of the foliage is enough to cause a reduction in tree grade.


","Current-season needles develop brown to tan bands shortly after shoots elongate. Later these areas turn reddish-brown and may involve the whole needle. These needles are shed, but needles with banding remain on the tree. Worst on grand fir, not as bad on noble fir. Does not seem to be common on Nordmann fir. Not specific to any area of the grand fir tree but does occur more frequently on the upper portions of noble fir. Does not affect all trees in a group nor specific trees year after year. May be confused with needle rust, sunburn or heat stress, herbicide injury, and moisture stress.


","Some ""Danish"" sources of noble fir are more resistant to CSNN than Pacific Northwest sources that are typically use for Christmas trees. Testing of Nordmann and Turkish fir trees also indicates there are sources of more resistant types.

","Foliar applications of calcium chloride during shoot elongation reduce incidence of symptomatic needles; however, this is not recommended because it can burn needle tips. Various fertility programs have also not been effective in reducing symptom development.


",
"Fir, True ",(Abies spp.)-Drought Injury,"Many conifers are susceptible to drought stress especially noble fir, grand fir, Pacific silver fir, Subalpine fir, Alaska yellow cedar, Engelman spruce, Sitka spruce, western red cedar, and western hemlock. Douglas-fir and incense cedar are more tolerant of drought than noble or grand fir but can have similar problems on lower elevation, south-facing or marginal sites. Newly planted trees are most at risk to drought damage. Drought-stressed trees are highly susceptible to secondary attack from insects and canker-causing fungi. Loss of older needles may be a survival mechanism to reduce moisture loss. Drought damage can accumulate over several years of subnormal precipitation and persist after normal conditions return. During extreme warm, dry weather, trees may not regenerate rootlets fast enough to replace those lost to moisture stress. The degenerating root system results in crown decline, which in turn reduces food supply to roots. This process is known as carbon starvation. Hydraulic failure, where water loss from transpiration is greater than the uptake by roots, can also result in progressive cavitation and conductivity loss in the xylem. Similar symptoms occur from winter injury when soil becomes frozen and water is unavailable. This problem can be observed in the landscape and in potted nursery trees. In some potted plants, the root-shoot ratio is so lopsided that trees have a difficult time maintaining water levels.


","Drought injury usually progresses from the top of the tree downward and from the outside to the inside of the crown. Dieback at the top of the tree and/or tips of the branches, where water has the furthest to travel, is also common. Premature loss of needles at the mid-crown; base and tip of shoots can also occur in Douglas-fir. Older needles commonly turn yellow and are shed prematurely. Roots may still be alive even though the entire aboveground canopy appears to be dead but these trees will not survive. Winter injury, gopher and root weevil problems can produce similar symptoms.


","

1) Maintain soil moisture through supplemental irrigation for landscape and potted trees. Trees require infrequent, slow and deep watering to allow water to penetrate soils and be taken up by roots.

2) Plant drought tolerant species on soils more likely to produce drought problems such as thin, porus, or rocky soil.

3) Grass, weed. and brush control will help get rid of competing vegetation and conserve existing water.

4) Plant in the late fall or early spring to help establish root systems before annual summer and fall drought periods.

5) Do not fertilize during droughts, fertilization increases growth and therefore water requirements.

6) Mulching around the base of trees will help conserve water, suppresses weeds, improve soil quality, and enhance tree growth.

"Fir, True ",(Abies spp.)-Grovesiella Canker,"The fungus Grovesiella abieticola can cause a canker and dieback on true fir. The fungus is found growing primarily on lower branches and stems. Young trees are attacked most often, making this a more serious disease in nurseries and Christmas tree plantations than in natural stands. White fir and shasta fir are more susceptible than noble fir or grand fir.
The life cycle is not well understood. Mature fruiting bodies can be found any time of year, even up to a year later on dead branches removed from infected trees. Time and location of infection and the time between infection and canker development are unknown. Cankers continue to expand if not removed from infected trees.


","Sunken, dead areas (cankers) develop on branches or stems older than 1 year. Generally the branch above the canker is swollen or enlarged and tapers distal to the infection. Twigs also may die back. Occasionally entire saplings are killed when the canker completely girdles the stem. Tops of larger trees may survive up to a year after being completely girdled, making early detection difficult. Small (0.5 to 1 mm in diameter) gray-black fruiting bodies (apothecia) of the fungus may be found on the canker's surface. No wood staining accompanies infection.
The disease can be confused with Phytophthora root rot or shoot blight when flagging branches are low to the ground.


","

1) Cut out and destroy infected trees in Christmas tree plantations.

2) Removing and immediately destroying cankered branches from infected trees in ornamental nurseries or landscapes can help. Regular scouting aids in detecting cankers early.

3) Isolating susceptible species from other species may help reduce disease spread in the nursery.

"Fir, True ",(Abies spp.)-Interior Needle Blight,"Unknown. It is thought that it is due to the fungus Mycosphaerella sp.; however, several other fungi colonize the affected needles but are found less frequently. They include Phaeocryptopus nudus, Phyllosticta abietina, and Rhizosphaera pini. It is unknown whether one or more of these fungi are the primary cause or simply infect necrotic needles that have died from some other factor(s). The result is a needle cast of noble fir and, to a lesser extent, grand fir Christmas trees. Cool moist weather during needle emergence and early shoot growth favors disease development.


","Needles on lower, interior branches become brown but remain firmly attached in late summer and early fall. Trees are noticeably affected and are unmarketable that season. Needles abscise and fall off by the following spring. Small, black, fruiting bodies (pycnidia, pseudothecia, or perithecia, depending on the fungus), develop on needles' undersurfaces in spring when they begin to abscise.

During the third growing season, fruiting bodies and spores are produced.


","Infections may remain symptomless until early in the second growing season, when needles turn brown or tan. Both fungi form long, dark brown sexual fruiting bodies (apothecia) on the undersides of needles. They can be differentiated from each other by the arrangement of asexual fruiting bodies (pycnidia) on the needles' upper surfaces. V. robusta forms two rows of light brown pycnidia on the needle margins. L. abietis-concoloris forms a single brown line of pycnidia down the center of the needle. After spores are shed, needles fall off. Repeated infection and defoliation leaves the tree with only two needle complements.

Specific about the life cycle of Neonectria are not known. Research in Scandinavia has shown that this fungus is an active pathogen of true fir and not just a secondary invader of previously-damaged plant tissue. Both landscape and Christmas tree crops have shown damage. Spread of the pathogen is thought to be associated with rain-splashed spores. It is suspected that insect vectors, such as bark beetles, and associations with other problems such as adelgid is possible.


","Sunken, dead areas (cankers) develop on branches. Branch ends and large portions of the canopy (flagging) to whole trees may die. Resin flow may be noted on damaged trees.

These organisms produce swimming spores called zoospores. Generally, a problem on poorly drained sites or areas where water flows through a plantation. Most trees die within the first 3 to 4 years of planting. Shasta, Balsam, Nordmann, noble, white, Fraser, and grand fir are susceptible. Nursery infection can occur but symptoms may not show until planted in the landscape.


","One to several roots become infected and die. The fungus continues to invade the root crown or collar causing the cambium and phloem to become a red-brown or butterscotch color. Seedlings often die, older trees may develop necrotic cankers, which are also dark red to dark brown. There generally is a sharp line between infected and healthy tissues. Stem cankers are narrow, long, and may spiral up the tree starting from the infected root and root crown area. Bark splits and pitch may accompany necrotic cankers. Lower branches may wilt and die, with needles turning dark red. Apical growth is also diminished. Use a pocket knife to determine where the canker is coming from to distinguish it from Grovesiella canker.


","

1) Plant healthy stock plants. Destroy plants with rotting roots before planting.

2) Improve soil drainage.

3) Avoid planting in waterways, ditches, and poorly drained soil.

4) Do not track or move soil from infected sites to other areas of the plantation.

5) Plant less susceptible tree species such as Douglas-fir or resistant Nordman or Turkish fir. Graft susceptible scion onto resistant rootstock such as Fraser scion on momi fir rootstock.

6) Avoid reusing pots from a previous crop for propagation. If pots must be reused then wash off all debris and soak in a sanitizing solution or treat with aerated steam for 30 min.

","Use in conjunction with cultural controls. Rotate between materials from different groups with different modes of action to prevent or delay the development of resistant fungi. Applications of fungicides in noble fir Christmas tree plantations have not generally been effective in controlling this disease. Limited success was obtained on Fraser fir in North Carolina when conditions were not conducive to disease development. Chemical control may only be effective if disease occurs late in the production cycle.

"Fir, True ",(Abies spp.)-Rusts,"The principal rust in Oregon is Uredinopsis pteridis. In Washington both U. pteridis and Pucciniastrum goeppertianum are common. U. pteridis will infect all true fir (noble, grand, concolor, silver, balsam, and Shasta) and its alternate host is bracken fern. The disease is more prevalent on seedlings and saplings. Rusts vary in intensity from year to year. Cool, moist springs favor disease development.
Infection occurs during May and June. A slight discoloration of severely infected needles may occur in fall or winter. Tube-like aecia develop the next spring and for 1 or 2 more years. Aeciospores can infect bracken fern any time in the growing season. Several spore stages occur on the fern, some of which can reinfect other bracken fern. Telia develop on the fern and overwinter in dead fronds. Spores germinate in spring and then reinfect other fir.
P. goeppertianum will infect grand, silver, balsam, and subalpine firs. The alternate hosts are Vaccinium spp., including huckleberry, blueberry, and cranberry. Similar conditions favor this rust; however, a uredinial state has not been found.


","The most characteristic symptom is the white tube-like fruiting structures (aecia) on the lower needle surface. Aecia of U. pteridis can mature on current-year needles in fall or winter but usually develop on previous year's needles in spring. Aecia of P. geoppertianum can mature on current-year needles in late summer or on previous year's needles in early summer. These fruiting structures contain the aeciospores. Uredinopsis spores are white or colorless, P. goeppertianum are yellow. Severe infections will result in needle drop. Aeciospores can be found on needles of all age classes.
Symptoms on fern are chlorotic markings on the upper surface and white pustules (uredinia) on the lower surface.
Symptoms on Vaccinium include a witches' broom of thickened stems with few or no leaves. Telia form in a reddish brown layer around stems each year.


","Remove and destroy the alternate host for at least 1000 ft around plantations. Simply waiting until late summer and applying an herbicide will not prevent sporulation on bracken fern in spring.

","Best used before infections are likely to occur from bud break through new shoot growth.

"Fir, True ",(Abies spp.)-Shoot Blight,"Several species of Phytophthora, including P. citricola and P. citrophthora. This disease occurs is favored when trees are irrigated from overhead. Whether the fungus-like microorganism enters the main trunk or is limited only to branches varies with species. Phytophthora shoot blight has been found on noble (Abies procera), alpine (A. lasiocarpa), Algerian (A. numidica), and balsam (A. balsemea) fir in Oregon and has been reported on red (A. magnifica) and white (A. concolor) fir in California. Both Christmas trees and container-grown trees can develop the disease.


","Branch dieback usually is first noticed when needles at branch tips turn red. Wood under the bark is medium brown with a distinct margin where dead (necrotic) tissue adjoins healthy tissue. Often, necrotic tissue extends farther down the twig than is indicated by the red needles. Infection may move from branches into the trunk. Afflicted branches may appear on any side of the tree and at any height. Leaders also can be affected. Older stems on which the disease is well developed have sunken cankers that ooze sap profusely.
Shoot blight caused by Phytophthora can be differentiated from Grovesiella by the following characteristics. Grovesiella-produces black fruiting bodies; no staining of wood; affected branches swell above the canker. Phytophthora-no fruiting bodies visible; wood of affected branch is brown; no swelling.


","

1) Avoid overhead irrigation.

2) Remove and destroy affected branches below the infection or discolored cambium.

3) Prevent potted plants in nurseries from falling over allowing foliage to touch the ground.

Flax ,(Linum spp.)-Rust,"Melampsora lini, a fungus that survives year to year in flax stubble and moves by spores from field to field. Spores also can be carried on small pieces of plant debris mixed with seed. The fungus has many different races, each of which infects a different set of Linum spp. Weakens plants and reduces quality and yield of linseed.


","Light-yellow to orange-yellow spots (pycnia and aecia) appear on leaves and stems in spring. Later, reddish yellow uredinia form on leaves and stems followed by the black telia late in the season.


","

1) Use resistant cultivars.

2) Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization.

3) Plow in infected stems and stubble after harvest.

4) Rotate crops and remove wild or volunteer plants.

5) Use clean seed.

",,
Flax ,(Linum spp.)-Wilt,"A fungus, Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. lini, which survives in soil and plant debris as thick-walled, dormant chlamydospores. These spores germinate in response to exudates from nearby plant roots. Hyphae then penetrate the roots, colonize the cortex and move into the xylem tissue. Small spores (microconidia) are produced and carried up into the plant. The fungus sporulates on decaying plant tissue, and these spores can be moved by wind or rain to spread disease. This fungus can also be seedborne. Disease is favored by warm weather and often occurs in patches.


","Plants may be attacked at any stage of development. Seedling blight can occur when soil temperatures are high while flax is in the seedling stage. When older plants are attacked, leaves turn yellow or grayish yellow, and growth stops. Often the top of an affected plant turns downward. Sometimes plants die completely, or the primary stem dies and new, apparently healthy laterals arise from the stem base.


","

1) Rotation between flax crops should be at least several years.

2) Use -free seed at sowing.

3) Use resistant cultivars. The cultivar Cascade is resistant to wilt.

4) Use a soilless medium or pasteurized soil to start seedlings. Also disinfect any tools and equipment that might be used and contaminate the media.

5) Use care in watering. If using a hose, take care not to splash, and keep the nozzle and hose off the ground, walkways, or other surfaces that may be contaminated.

6) Keep benches and premises clean. Do not use sides of low benches as a footrest; soil on shoes may be contaminated. Keep walkways and areas beneath benches clean and free of plant debris.

7) Use composted hardwood or conifer bark. The suppressive effect should last about 1 year at which time potted plants may be repotted into fresh media.

8) Use clean irrigation water.

9) Avoid reusing pots from a previous crop for propagation. If pots must be reused then wash off all debris and soak in a sanitizing solution or treat with aerated steam for 30 min.

Forget-me-not ,(Myosotis spp.)-Powdery Mildew,"Golovinomyces cynoglossi (formerly Erysiphe cynoglossi) is a common garden problem. This fungus is favored by conditions that produce high humidity but dry leaves. It is a highly specialized pathogen that forms a close association with the host. Conditions that favor the host also favor the pathogen. Much of the fungus remains outside infected plant parts where it grows on the surface but sinks root-like structures called haustoria into plant cells to obtain nutrients. The white growth seen is composed of both mycelium and fungal spores. Found more frequently after plants flowered and during senescence. Unknown if it is limiting plant growth or production.


","White patches of dense mycelium, tending to become grayish brown, on leaf surfaces and stems. Leaves frequently show chlorotic mottling. Leaves may eventually turn yellow and wither.

Forsythia,Bacterial Blight,"Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae, a bacterium. Environmental factors play an important role with diseases caused by this bacterium. Rainy weather, winter or frost injury, and poor growing conditions favor disease development. Two common genetic traits increase the bacteria's ability to cause disease. Most produce a powerful plant toxin, syringomycin, which destroys plant tissues as bacteria multiply in a wound. Bacteria also produce a protein that acts as an ice nucleus, increasing frost wounds that bacteria easily colonize and expand.
Cold temperature injury is a common diagnosis when no pathogens are recovered from injured tissue.

Freesia,Corm Rot,"The OSU Plant Clinic has found Fusarium spp. on several corm and root rot samples of Freesia. Several different Fusarium spp. have been isolated and shown to cause wilting and corm rots. All fall into the Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. gladioli category.  These fungi live in soil and plant debris for many years as chlamydospores. Spores infect roots and cross the basal plate.

Fuchsia,Botrytis Blight,"Botrytis cinerea, a fungus.  Survives in plant debris, favored by high moisture and low temperatures. Under cool, humid conditions, and low light levels in greenhouses, the disease spreads rapidly. Severe water stress in the spring can cause fuchsia flower buds to abort and lower leaf yellowing or defoliation. This in turn can encourage more disease development as this fungus colonized these dead or weakened tissues. Growing fuchsias under conditions that are too warm can result in soft plants that cannot withstand shipping.


","Infected leaves and flower parts develop a soft, brown decay. Stems can develop dark cankered areas resulting in wilting of foliage above that point. In humid conditions, a fuzzy fungal growth that is brown-to-gray appears around the infected tissues.

Fuchsia,Root Rot,"Pythium rostratum and P. ultimum, fungus-like microorganisms. Found several times over the years by OSU's Plant Clinic. Poorly drained, waterlogged soil or media favors these water-mold organisms. They survive unfavorable periods in soil and infected plant debris. Under favorable conditions, spores germinate and infect roots. After infection, the fungus-like microorganism spreads mainly in the inner bark tissues of the root and stems. A thick-walled survival structure, oospores, are produced that can persist for several years. Movement of infected plants and/or soil can spread the organism.
Allowing fuchsias to dry between irrigations during short days is important for proper growth and root development. Once in hanging pots and especially when flowering, make sure plants do not dry out. Also, growing fuchsias under conditions that are too warm can result in soft plants that cannot withstand shipping.


","Fine roots die, turning dark-brown to black.


","

1) Do not overwater or let plants stand in waterlogged soil. Allow to dry between irrigations especially during short days.

2) Use a well-drained container medium.

3) Use sterile soil or potting mix and disinfect any tools or equipment that might be used and contaminate the media.

4) Growing conditions require 68°F to 70°F nights and partial (not full) sun during the day. Some growers maintain growing temperatures in low 60s for day and high 50s for night, which can be increased to the mid 60s once plants are in hanging baskets.

5) Media pH should be between 5.5 to 6 and check the electrolyte concentration at regular intervals. High salts have been diagnosed regularly by OSU's Plant Clinic and can contribute to Pythium root rot problems.

6) Avoid reusing pots or trays from a previous crop for propagation. If pots must be reused then wash off all debris and soak in a sanitizing solution or treat with aerated steam for 30 min.

7) When transplanting do not cover the root crown with excessive media or soil. Transplant back to the original soil line.

Fuchsia,Rust,"Pucciniastrum epilobii f. sp. palustris, a fungus, has been reported from Oregon and Washington. It also infects fireweed (Epilobium sp.) and true fir (Abies spp.). On fir it produces yellowish, tubular aecia on current-year true fir needles that mature several weeks before P. goeppertianum. Spores produced on fir infect only fuchsia or fireweed. Older fuchsia leaves are more susceptible, and low light favors disease development. The rust can overwinter and maintain itself in the uredinial state independent of alternating to true fir.


","Pale or yellow spots develop that may progress rapidly to tan or brown necrotic spots or blotches. On some cultivars, spots may be on only a few leaves or have purple borders. Small, yellow to reddish fruiting bodies (uredinia) develop in irregular groups along the margins of necrotic spots on the undersides of the leaves but are easily overlooked. Severely diseased leaves dry up and drop off. Defoliation weakens plants, which may recover or die.

Garlic ,(Allium sativum)-Basal Rot,"Fusarium culmorum (formerly F. roseum), a fungus. The fungus also can infect elephant garlic but not to the same degree as garlic. Cereals can be infected, but strains usually found on cereals do not infect garlic. Onion is not a host. Soilborne inoculum infects garlic through the stem plate rather than through roots or storage leaves. Infected cloves may not produce disease symptoms but can be a source of the disease. Transmission can occur when infested soil or debris is transported on equipment, seed, or runoff water. Disease expression is erratic from year to year and field to field. Factors affecting disease development are not known.
The disease has been found in Oregon and British Columbia ranging from low incidence to 40% bulb loss. Additional losses can continue during storage.


","Preemergence decay of cloves and seedlings can occur. Stem plates and storage leaves may decay in the field during the growing season. A reddish fringe to basal rot lesions of actively growing plants may occur but is not diagnostic. Postharvest decay may involve a single clove or the entire bulb.

Garlic ,(Allium sativum)-Neck Rot (Gray Mold),"Botrytis porri and B. aclada (formerly B. alliiaclada), fungi. Both fungi are found in western Oregon but only B. porri is found on garlic east of the Cascade Range. These pathogens survive the winter on dead plant parts in soil, as sclerotia, and on infected bulbs. Infection occurs through neck tissue or through wounds in bulbs. Severe losses are most commonly from excessive irrigation and/or rain. Other factors such as excessive nitrogen, inadequate or improper curing, and improper storage have not been investigated.


","The disease usually appears first on necks near the soil line at any time after spring greenup when weather conditions permit. The disease becomes worse when it starts early in the season. Extensive development of sclerotia is best seen on maturing bulbs just before and during harvest. The fungus moves rapidly into the succulent garlic bulb's neck region, producing a water-soaked appearance. A gray mold develops on the surface of or between garlic scales, later producing black bodies (sclerotia), which develop around the neck. Before bulbing, plants may die or recover if weather permits. Bulbs infected late break down to a soft mass, and secondary infections by other organisms follow.


","Difficult to control in extended wet weather.

1) Allow the tops to mature well, then lift or undercut the garlic.

2) If normal dry weather prevails, cure garlic on the ground for 6 to 10 days.

3) When topping, keep bruising and mechanical injury to a minimum.

4) Store garlic in well-ventilated houses at temperatures of 32°F, or just slightly higher.

5) Avoid frequent and excessive irrigation.

6) Visual inspection of seed garlic with a hand lens may help. Examine the basal plate or bottom of garlic for gray mold.

Garlic ,"(Allium sativum)-Nematode, Stem and Bulb","Ditylenchus dipsaci, several strains of which are known to be in Oregon. The only known hosts for the garlic strain belong to the onion family: garlic, onion, leek, and chive. However, it also attacks shasta pea, parsley, celery, nightshade, and salsify.
The host usually is invaded through natural openings, but these nematodes also can provide their own avenue of entry. Once established, they move through tissues of host plants, break down cell walls, and feed on cell contents. They attack the plant's basal plate. Nematodes can live in stored plant tissue at least 9 years but decline rapidly in soil. They spread principally through planting infected stock. They are carried beneath the protective leaf and abscission layer (where the clove attaches the main stem).


","Diseased cloves generally show no symptoms but can be detected by examining tissue microscopically. In the field, top growth yellows and ripens prematurely. The whole bulb may separate from the basal plate. In severe cases, cloves will break down into a spongy mass due to secondary rotting organisms, leaving little evidence of cloves or bulbs at harvest time. Under cool growing conditions, affected plants may show few or no symptoms. High temperatures bring on symptoms quickly.


","

1) Eradicate volunteer garlic plants from fields having a history of bulb or stem nematode.

2) Avoid other hosts of the nematode in your rotation if possible.

3) Do not plant garlic at least 2 years in fields known to be infested with bulb or stem nematode.

4) Plant only nematode-free cloves.

5) Soak cloves at 100°F for 30 min. in water containing 0.1% surfactant; then soak at 120°F for 20 min. in the same kind of solution. Cool cloves in tap water for 10 to 20 min. before drying for 2 hours at 100°F, or plant if possible. This helps eradicate the bulb or stem nematode from loose (cracked) cloves but not from intact bulbs.

2) Lime soils with a pH below 6. Disk lime into the top 2 or 3 inches of soil so it is in the raised bed formed during planting. It is critical that the lime not be plowed 10 to 12 inches deep.

3) Use soil tests to guide fertilization. Limit potassium chloride applications, which tend to increase manganese uptake.

Garlic ,(Allium sativum)-Rust,"Puccinia allii on garlic, onion and wild Allium species. This fungus has caused major epidemics in California and losses in Arizona and Oregon. California isolates did not infect leek, shallot or elephant garlic. However, P. allii in Europe is extremely damaging on leek.
This fungus may overwinter on volunteer garlic and onions, or on wild hosts. When seed cloves, collected from rust-infected garlic plants, were planted (studies by the University of California), none of the plants that grew from these cloves developed rust. The rust is autoecious, and same-season reinfection by urediniospores is common. Severe losses are reported when rain, fog, or irrigation are excessive. Infection rates are highest at cool temperatures (50°F to 59°F) and 100% relative humidity; at least 4 hours of leaf wetness is required for infection. Temperatures below 50°F and above 75°F inhibit the disease. No resistant garlic lines have been identified.


","Initial symptoms include small white to yellow flecks and spots. The spots enlarge and become oval to elongate or diamond shaped and take on an orange cast as uredinia develop. Later in the season, black oval to elongate telia develop. These telia may or may not break through the epidermis. Telia of a related species, P. asparagi, found occasionally on onion, tend to be dark brown rather than black. Heavily infected plants have an orange cast, outer leaves may yellow and wither prematurely, and bulb size may be reduced.


","

1) Rotate out of  crops for 2 to 3 years and destroy all volunteers and  weeds.

2) Avoid consecutive plantings of garlic or onion.

3) Plow under infected plant residues.

4) Avoid dense plantings which favors disease.

5) Avoid over application of  nitrogen which enhances infections.

6) Avoid wetting of the leaves.

Garlic ,(Allium sativum)-White Rot,"Sclerotium cepivorum, a fungus. Enough sclerotia from an initially high population may survive 20 to 30 years or more in soil without the presence of an Allium host to incite unacceptable levels of disease in the next Allium crop. Only Allium spp. such as onion, leek, and shallot are attacked. Sclerotia can infect plants from 12 inches below the surface. One sclerotium can infect a group of 20 to 30 adjacent plants. Fungal activity is favored by cool soils and is restricted above 75°F. Once the disease is in a field, it is very difficult to grow Allium spp. successfully.


","Leaves decay at the base, turn yellow, wilt, and topple over. Older leaves collapse first. Roots are rotted, and the top of the plant can be pulled out of the ground easily. Fluffy white mycelium may be on remaining roots and bulb. The affected bulb may become watery, and the outer scales crack as it dries and shrinks. Small (0.02 inch) sclerotia form in affected bulb parts and on the surface, often around the neck. Sclerotia are smaller and rounder than those of the neck rot disease.


","Idaho, Oregon, and Washington laws forbid importing cloves, bulbs, or other material infected with white rot into some areas of each state.

1) Plant only pathogen-free cloves in pathogen-free soil.

2) Wash equipment before entering a field to avoid moving soil contaminated with sclerotia into new fields.

3) Hot water seed treatment (see Garlic ()-Nematode, Stem and Bulb) kills sclerotia on clove surfaces but will not destroy all fungus within cloves.

4) If practical, dig out all plants in infested spots in the field. Also remove healthy plants next to diseased plants. Remove some soil with both diseased and healthy plants. Dispose of the material in a landfill or hot composting operation.

","If soil in the top several inches remains above 75°F part of the day through much of the growing season, fungicides can give control. Under cooler conditions, even the best chemicals control only a portion of the disease, and soils frequently become useless for the production of all Allium spp.


1) Treating heavily infected areas of organic soils with tarped fumigation has been useful in reducing inoculum in infested fields but alone may not provide sufficient control.

Geranium ,(Pelargonium spp.)-Bacterial Blight,"Xanthomonas hortorum pv. pelargonii (formerly X. campestris pv. pelargoni), a bacterium. Other Xanthomonas spp. can also cause similar but less severe symptoms including X. codiaei and X. axonopodis pv. poinsettiaecola. These bacteria can survive in association with plant debris in the soil for 6 months or more depending on the rate of plant decomposition. Bacteria cannot survive in association with plant debris in the soil after the plant debris decomposes. Bacteria are readily spread by physical contact, irrigation water, rain, tools, and insects but are not contained in seed. Seedling geraniums are susceptible but are free of the disease unless grown in close proximity to vegetatively-propagated plants. The pathogen enters leaf hydathodes when splash dispersed and then moves into the rest of the plant through the vascular system. Infected plants may remain symptomless at cool temperatures until warm conditions return. Some cultivars of regal or Martha Washington geraniums are very resistant, but leaf spots have been observed. Hardy, perennial geraniums can be non-symptomatic carriers of the bacteria. Sources of bacteria may include poinsettia, croton (Codiaeum variegatum), crown of thorns (Euphorbia milli) and zebra plant (Aphelandra squarrosa).


","Cuttings-sudden black rotting that starts at the base of the cutting. Cuttings usually fail to root.
Stem-blue-black rotting on parts of stems. Leaves drop, then stems partially recover and produce new leaves at the terminals. In the case of Verticillium stem dieback, affected stems do not recover. The two diseases are easily confused.
Leaf-depending on the cultivar affected, symptoms are either round spots or angular, sometimes V-shaped, dead areas. Spots may initially appear as small translucent pustules similar to those, which are characteristic of oedema. Round spots are dark green to black, about 0.0625 to 0.125 inch wide, and slightly sunken. Affected leaves wilt and die; leaves may stay on the plant for some time afterward. Angular, dead areas occur when sectors of leaves bounded by the veins die. This symptom is accompanied by a wilting of leaf edges. Bacteria from leaf spots may spread down the petiole, into the stem, then back to the top of the plant. Ivy geranium foliage loses luster and develops symptoms suggesting nutrient deficiency or mite infestation.


","Prevention is the key because once the disease gets in a crop then destruction of infected plants, as well as the plants adjacent to those infected plants, is the only practical control.

1) Grow plants from seed.

2) Use bacteria-tested (and found to be free of all known bacteria) certified stock plants. Vascular-inhabiting bacteria are carried over in cuttings from symptomless infected plants, from obviously diseased plants, or from recently infested soil.

3) Insist that workers not handle  or  spp. in other locations before working in the greenhouse. Have them wash their hands if they do.

4) Do not grow geraniums around or near the greenhouse production area.

5) Set out stock in sterilized soil or soilless planting media.

6) Prevent contaminating stock plants by disinfecting cutting knives and other tools frequently. Soak tools 60 sec in 10% bleach (Clorox) or shellac thinner (70% ethyl alcohol) or quaternary ammonium (Physan 20).

7) Keep plants from different propagators separate, as an outbreak may be confined to only one source.

8) Prevent or minimize splashing when watering plants.

9) Use no more than 63°F bottom heat. Do not use bottom heat for pelargoniums.

10) Do not put ivy geraniums in hanging baskets over geraniums on the bench.

11) Scout often for early detection. Remove and test any plants that look suspect.

12) Carefully remove and discard any symptomatic plants or those that test positive for the bacteria. Also remove and discard adjacent plants.

13) Discard all remaining geraniums at the end of the production cycle and keep greenhouse free of geraniums for as long as possible before resuming geranium production.

","Focus efforts primarily on cultural controls. Applying copper-containing materials sometimes induces rapid yellowing of infected plants. Such plants are then more easily identified and discarded.

Geranium ,(Pelargonium spp.)-Black Root Rot,,,,,
Geranium ,(Pelargonium spp.)-Blackleg and Damping-off,"Pythium spp., a fungus-like microorganism. Pythium ultimum and P. irregulare have been associated with geraniums in the Northeastern United States as a problem on both cuttings and mature plants. The organism is soilborne and favored by overwatering and poor soil drainage. It survives unfavorable periods in soil and infected plant debris. It can be found in field soil, sand from streams or rivers, and pond or lake sediment. Under favorable conditions, spores germinate and infect roots. After infection, the fungus-like microorganism spreads mainly in the inner bark tissues of the root and stems. A thick-walled survival structure, oospores, are produced that can persist several years. Movement of infected plants and/or soil can spread the organism. Plants grown at high fertility can be most susceptible.


","Poor stand development or seedling collapse are indicative of damping-off. Seeds or emerging radicles may be rotted. After emergence, stems, roots, and cotyledons may rot at or below the soil line. Cutting rot starts at the cut end as a brown water-soaked rot and progresses up, turning coal black until leaves wilt and the stem dies. Mature plants may be stunted, drop leaves, and die. Stems turn black, also progressing up. Root tips appear translucent and water-soaked. The outer layer of root tissue easily strips off leaving the central core of tissue bare. Fusarium sp. infection also can cause a black stem disease.


","Difficult to manage once rot has begun so focus on preventing disease development.

1) Use pathogen-free propagation material.

2) Steam the rooting media or use a sterile, soilless potting mix. Also disinfect any tools and equipment that might be used and contaminate the media.

3) Clean and disinfect cutting knives often.

4) Avoid overwatering plants.

5) Keep hose ends off the ground.

6) Maintain optimum (not excessive) plant fertility.

7) Media pH should be around 6 to 6.6 (5.5 for ivy geraniums) and soil temperature at 65°F; check the electrolyte concentration at regular intervals. Note that geraniums tend to naturally lower the growing media pH.

8) Remove and destroy infected plants and their containers.

9) Control shoreflies that can spread the fungus. Fungus gnats are not a vector of . See the  for details.

10) Avoid reusing pots or trays from a previous crop for propagation. If pots must be reused then wash off all debris and soak in a sanitizing solution or treat with aerated steam for 30 min.

","Use only with cultural controls. Rotate or tank-mix materials from different groups with different modes of action.  Isolates resistant to Banol and/or Mefenoxam or Subdue have been reported from North America. Isolates resistant to Mefenoxam are able to cause more damping-off in the presence of the chemical.

"
Geranium ,(Pelargonium spp.)-Botrytis Blight,"Botrytis cinerea, a fungus. . All aboveground parts of seedlings and mature plants are susceptible. Spores are readily spread by air and the fungus can infect intact or wounded tissues. The disease is most prevalent in cool, moist greenhouses where plants are irrigated frequently. High relative humidity, moisture on the plant, and temperatures between 64°F and 77°F favor infection. Any activity in the greenhouse that changes the relative humidity quickly or disturbs the pants can result in the release of spores. Flower susceptibility increases with age, the lowest point being when they first open. Stock plants can be an important source of infection. Lower leaves of cuttings may yellow, abscise, and harbor the fungus, leading to losses during propagation.


","Brown, water-soaked areas appear on leaves and petals. Spots dry out and are covered by brown masses of fungus growth. Flowers wilt and drop. Brown zonate leaf lesions often result after petals drop on leaves. Stock plants may develop a stem blight, which can progress down the main stem. ""Ghost spots"" can also occur if a lesion has been arrested.


","An integrated strategy combing environmental management, cultural practices, and fungicides will most effectively manage this disease.

1) Thoroughly clean and sanitize the greenhouse before production.

2) Remove and destroy leaves showing infection and any fading flowers. Place into a closed container for removal from the greenhouse.

3) Do not hang plants above that would tend to drop faded flowers onto geraniums.

4) Increase spacing between plants.

5) Water at base of plants and/or with drip irrigation. Do not wet foliage.

6) Reduce humidity by increasing temperature and improving ventilation. Particularly important for stock plants the first 24 hours after taking cuttings.

7) Forcing dry air for 2 days on cut geranium stock plants, beginning within hours of cutting, significantly reduced gray mold.Avoid leaving large stubs on stock plants after cutting.

","Use as foliar sprays in conjunction with cultural control methods. Resistance can become a problem with repeated use of a single product. Tank-mix or rotate materials from different groups with different modes of action. Limit the use of any one group during the growing season.

Geranium ,(Pelargonium spp.)-Mosaic (Impatiens Necrotic Spot),,"Symptomless infections can occur. Mosaic, mottling, stem and leaf necrosis, leaf deformation, yellow spots, and ringspots and stunted growth have been associated with Impatiens necrotic spot virus (INSV) and Tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV).


",,,
Geranium ,(Pelargonium spp.)-Oedema,"A physiological problem on many greenhouse plants including geranium. Oedema (edema) is more prominent when air temperatures are lower than soil temperatures, soil moisture is high, and relative humidity is high. Low transpiration rates with an increase in water absorption increase cell pressure, erupting epidermal cells and allowing the inner cells to enlarge and protrude. This protrusion kills the cells and discolors them (yellow, brown, or rust), giving the impression that a parasitic organism is involved. Light levels, low nutrition, and high soil moisture each contribute to oedema development in Pelargonium spp. Ivy geraniums and the cultivar Irene are considered very susceptible. Also affected are Brassica, Dracaena, Fatshedera, Peperomia, and Polyscias. Other plants that can be affected include camellia, eucalyptus, hibiscus, privet, schefflera, and yew.
Few experimental trials on management of edema exist. Consistent root media water content or supplemental calcium applications did not affect the development of edema on ivy geraniums grown in Kansas. Another study indicated that large fluctuations in root media water might contribute to the development of edema. Plant exposed to far-red irradiation did not develop edema.


","This condition is usually found on lower leaf surfaces. The first symptom is few or numerous watery blisters or galls. Blisters or galls can turn a dark brown-yellow or rust color and look like a rust or bacterial infection. Later the swellings become light brown or tan and corky in texture. Lesions may be concentrated near the leaf margin. They also can be lighter than surrounding areas of the leaf. The entire leaf may yellow and die. Petioles and stems may also show symptoms. Can be confused with mite feeding.


","

1) Do not overwater especially during overcast, cloudy days.

2) Use a soilless mix that drains well.

3) Do not use saucers on hanging baskets.

4) Keep humidity low, by heating if necessary.

5) Maintain higher greenhouse temperature.

6) Media pH should be around 6 (5.5 for ivy geraniums) and soil temperature at 65°F; check the electrolyte concentration at regular intervals.

7) Note that geraniums tend to naturally lower the growing media pH.

Geranium ,(Pelargonium spp.)-Rust,"Puccinia pelargonii-zonalis, an autoecious (can complete their life cycle on this one host) rust fungus that survives on living plants and plant debris. Movement of infected cuttings can also spread this fungus. Infections occur readily if leaves are wet 5 to 6 hours at 55°F to 75°F. Urediniospores may be infective at least 3 months. Considerable genetic variation exists from highly susceptible to immune cultivars.


","Both leaf surfaces first develop white or yellowish spots. Spots on the lower surface enlarge and become blister-like pustules. These brown powdery pustules (uredinia) occur on leaves and, less frequently, on petioles and stems. Severe leaf infection causes yellowing and defoliation. Uredinia containing spores may be in concentric rings and may be surrounded by yellow tissue.

Geranium ,(Pelargonium spp.)-Shoot Proliferation and Leafy Gall,,,,,
Geranium ,(Pelargonium spp.)-Verticillium Wilt,"Verticillium dahliae, a soilborne fungus that survives in soil indefinitely. It can spread in infested soil, container media, irrigation water, or in symptomless infected cuttings. The fungus grows into the xylem where it colonizes the plant through mycelial growth and conidial production. Fluid movement in the xylem passively transports the conidia. Once in the xylem, this fungus partially blocks water movement and produces toxins that result in wilt symptoms. Many other ornamentals can be hosts.


","Infected plants may not show symptoms for several weeks or months. Symptoms can develop suddenly and lead to rapid death. Wedge-shape areas on affected leaves turn yellow; then the entire leaf turns yellow, wilts, or even drops off the stem. A few branches may show foliage collapse, defoliation, a dieback, and/or a brown to black discoloration. Affected plants may be stunted or defoliated. If leaves are left, they may become pale green and show interveinal yellowing. Symptoms can be very similar to those of bacterial blight.


","

Gerbera Daisy,Powdery Mildew,"Golovinomyces cichoracearum (formerly Erysiphe cichoracearum) is a fungus that is favored by moderate temperatures (68°F to 82°F) with alternating cool night and warm days and conditions that produce high humidity (80% to 90%) but dry leaves. A closed canopy and poor air circulation also promote disease development. It is a highly specialized  pathogen that forms a close association with the host. Conditions that favor the host also favor the pathogen. Much of the fungus remains outside infected plant parts where it grows on the surface but sinks root-like structures called haustoria into plant cells to obtain nutrients. The white growth seen is composed of both mycelium and fungal spores. Repeated outbreaks affect plant vigor and production.
The cultivars Snow White and Orange were the most susceptible; while Fuchsia and Hot Pink were less susceptible.


","Grayish white, powdery spots develop on leaves. These may be scattered at first but can quickly cover entire leaves giving them a frosty appearance. All aboveground plant parts can become infected including the flower stalk and petals. Discolored patches may appear on petals but may not look white and powdery, thus being confused with Botrytis or spray injury. Occasionally, a colony may develop on the underside of a leaf with a small, subtle yellow blotch on the opposite side of the leaf. Heavily infected plants lack vigor and may be reduced in size.


","

1) Space plants for good air circulation and light penetration. This will also help initiate more flower buds.

2) Heating the greenhouse at night and/or venting around sunset may be necessary to reduce humitity.

3) Scout regularly for symptoms and signs of the disease. Flag any area where it is found and scout more intensively in that area in the future.

4) Remove plant parts or plants that are infected from the greenhouse. Place in a sealed plastic bag while scouting other areas.

Ginseng ,(Panax spp.)-Alternaria Leaf and Stem Blight,"The fungus Alternaria panax, which is specific to ginseng. The fungus was found in Oregon and Washington for the first time in 2000, although it had been in British Columbia for many years. This disease affects both seedlings and established plants. The fungus will be a problem anywhere temperatures are moderate and relative humidity is at or above 95% in the canopy. The disease is worse in beds that are thickly planted and subject to prolonged moisture retention.
The fungus survives the winter on infected stems or leaves in the ginseng bed. Infection may first appear in the spring on young shoots shortly after they emerge from the soil or mulch. Wind, water splash, tools, or people moving through the beds can disperse the spores from stem or leaf lesions. During damp weather or high humidity, these spores will land on plant surfaces and initiate new infections. Sporulation, dissemination, and infection can occur several times within a single growing season.


","The fungus causes an elongated brown lesion on the stem, which becomes velvety with spores as the disease progresses. Stems may become girdled by the lesion, which causes the top of the plant to wilt or topple over. Leaves may also become infected. Leaf lesions begin as watersoaked or oily looking spots or, depending on the environmental conditions, yellow spots that later enlarge and dry out in the center. Leaf spots are usually noticed when the centers of the lesions are tan or straw color and are bordered by a thin brown margin, which is surrounded by yellow tissue. Roots are not normally affected.


","

1) Avoid overcrowding and space plants for good air movement within the beds. A good goal is 120 plants/sq yard; for example, use 90 to 100 lb seed/A if germination rate is 70%.

2) Increase aeration by planting where neighboring shrubbery or conifer canopies don't obstruct air movement.

3) Lift shade cloth on the sides of gardens on cloudy days to promote air movement.

4) Avoid using straw mulch; disease may be worse where straw is used. Straw is also attractive to slugs.

5) In small gardens it may be possible to hand pick and remove affected stems and foliage.

6) Irrigate early in the day so leaves will have a chance to dry before evening.

","In beds where this disease has been confirmed, applications must begin as soon as plants emerge in the spring. Repeated applications are necessary when environmental conditions are favorable. Tank-mix and/or alternate products from different groups with different modes of action to prevent the buildup of resistant fungi. Limit the use of any one group during crop production.

Ginseng ,(Panax spp.)-Cylindrocarpon Root Rot (Disappearing Root Rot),"Ilyonectria destructans (formerly Cylindrocarpon destructans) can cause a root rot of ginseng as well as a decay of woody seedlings such as confers. This fungus has also been associated with replant failure when ginseng is planted back into ground that had already been used for ginseng production (however, many other problems, biotic and abiotic, are likely involved). A different fungus causes the disorder known as rusty root.
Roots of all ages appear susceptible. The fungus penetrates the epidermis directly followed by intracellular hyphal growth in the cortex. Wounding and acidic (pH 5) growing conditions contribute to disease severity. Increased iron availability either in the soil or as foliar amendments was found to encourage disease severity by encouraging fungal growth and sporulation. Wet soils were not found to be a major factor.


","Plants may fail to come up in the spring; during the growing season, plants may rapidly wilt and not recover or show other symptoms of stress such as premature leaf coloration. Lesions progress over the surface of the root and move deep into the cortex. In advanced cases, lesions extend throughout the cross-section of the root, effectively severing it in two. The disease also can start at the root tip, causing a firm decay that progresses toward the crown. Under cool, moist conditions, the rot may progress to within 0.5 inch of the crown before the foliage wilts. In its most severe form, the disease leaves behind nothing but a fragile shell of the root; with the interior completely rotted away.


","The following have been suggested.

1) Maintain a neutral soil pH through the use of lime for acidic soils.

2) Avoid foliar applications of iron for plants grown on neutral or alkaline soils.

3) Minimize damage or wounding of roots during planting and harvest.

Ginseng ,(Panax spp.)-Damping-off,"Soilborne fungal and fungus-like microorganisms such as Rhizoctonia solani, Pythium sp., and Phytophthora sp. They are widespread in soil and can be very destructive under cool, moist conditions.


","Damping-off kills seedlings before or soon after they emerge from the soil. Beneath the soil a general rot is on affected seed. Seedlings that emerge develop a lesion on the stem near the soil surface. The seedling usually collapses; in some cases it continues to grow even though the lesion girdles the stem, but it grows poorly and eventually collapses. Main roots of affected seedlings are discolored, may develop forks, and lack secondary roots.


","

1) Avoid establishing beds in low areas that collect water.

2) Plant in beds raised at least 6 inches to improve drainage.

3) Do not plant ginseng immediately after alfalfa.

4) Avoid excessive seeding rates. A good goal is 120 plants/sq yard; for example, use 90 to 100 lb seed/A if germination rate is 70%.

5) Avoid excessive manure or fertilizer applications. If using a green manure, allow 3 weeks after turning in the green manure crop before planting.

6) Delay, when possible, shading the gardens in the spring until soil warms up, to encourage more rapid seedling emergence.

7) Avoid excessive fertilization or application of manures, which encourage lush growth that is more susceptible to disease.

Ginseng ,(Panax spp.)-Phytophthora Leaf Blight and Root Rot,"The soilborne fungus-like microorganism Phytophthora cactorum. Spores are produced on infected foliage and in roots. Spores are spread via water splash, surface water runoff, and movement of equipment and workers through the beds. Spores also survive up to at least a year in decayed plant material. The fungus-like microorganism can infect foliage and move down into roots, although direct root infections are more common.


","Plants of any age may be affected. Leaves that become infected are water soaked and wilt rapidly while still green. Symptoms of root rot are usually first noticed when the leaves ""flag"" or droop so they hang parallel with the stem, or they turn fall colors before it is fall. In very dry weather, leaves may wilt and rapidly desiccate. Under some conditions, the stem may be constricted at or near the soil line, or it may collapse altogether at the soil line and become detached from the root crown. The first indication of infection in the root is a yellowish orange or pinkish brown discoloration of the vascular tissue. Secondary roots may be discolored if present or may be lacking altogether. Primary roots of affected plants will be watersoaked, soft, and discolored pinkish brown as opposed to the white, firm appearance of a healthy root.


","

1) Avoid planting in low areas that collect water. In heavy soils, plant in beds raised at least 6 inches to improve drainage. Tile drainage may be needed for some soils.

2) Remove and destroy diseased plants and plant debris.

3) Provide good air movement by not planting too densely. A good goal is 120 plants/sq yard; for example, use 90 to 100 lb seed/A if germination rate is 70%.

4) Do not apply excessive mulch.

5) Weed and perform other tasks in healthy portions of the beds before moving to or through the diseased portions. Clean soil from tools and shoes before moving into healthy sections to prevent moving the fungus.

6) Incorporating composted tree bark in the soil before planting may help produce an environment suppressive to  for the first year. Composted pine bark mulch was shown to result in larger ginseng roots while composted pine, hardwood and fir bark has been shown to be suppressive to in other host systems.

7) Dig a perimeter trench around the garden that is lower than the garden beds to drain and collect water. Be sure to provide a drainage outlet for the trench that is aimed away from the garden.

","Focus on cultural controls. Use these products to prevent, not cure, the disease. The phenylamide and phosphonate fungicides (Group 4 and 33) used to manage Phytophthora do not kill this organism. They can only prevent establishment of the organism before it gets into the plant. They can also prevent continued growth if the organism is already inside the plant thereby delaying symptoms that might have developed. Once chemical activity has subsided with time, the organism can resume growth within infected plants. Rotate fungicides that have a different mode of action for resistance management.

Ginseng ,(Panax spp.)-Rusted Root,"Thought to be the fungus Rhexocercosporidium panacis on Canadian-grown American ginseng (Panax quinquifolius). Rusted root is a problem widely distributed throughout ginseng-growing areas, and has been a problem in cultivated ginseng for over 100 years. In China, Ilyonectria mors-panacis is thought to be the cause on P. notoginseng. The cause of rusted root has previously been attributed to species of Fusarium, Ramularia and Cylindrocarpon (= Ilyonecria for many of the species) in the US and Canada. Rhexocercosporidium panacis requires a selective medium for growth on isolation plates. This is a superficial disease distinct from disappearing root rot.
Growth of Rhexocercosporidium panacis in culture peaks at 15°C to 20°C, although the fungus will continue to grow and produce symptoms at 4ºC. Temperatures of soil under mulch during the summer are not likely to inhibit growth.


","Roots of all ages appear susceptible, but those older than one year are more commonly affected. Symptoms begin as aggregates of pinpoint, raised, rust-colored spots on the surface of the root, often near the crown. As the disease progresses, these aggregates expand into lesions that spread across the root but remain superficial, penetrating only a few cell layers into the periderm. Affected tissues may rupture and become colonized by other fungi. Affected periderm may also slough off, leaving shallow indentations in the roots. Affected plants usually do not produce obvious symptoms above ground, and symptoms may only be noticed upon digging.


","There is no known control for this disease.

Ginseng ,(Panax spp.)-Verticillium Wilt,"The soilborne fungus Verticillium dahliae. The relationship of the strains of V. dahliae that affect ginseng to the Verticillium diseases of other crops such as potatoes has not been determined. The fungus grows into the xylem where it colonizes the plant through mycelial growth and conidial production. Fluid movement in the xylem passively transports the conidia. Once in the xylem, this fungus partially blocks water movement and produces toxins that result in wilt symptoms.


","Foliar symptoms are premature reddening or yellowing, or wilting while green. Vascular tissue in affected roots is discolored a dark brown to black, which appears as a dark ring in cross-section.

Gladiolus,Bacterial Scab,"Burkholderia gladioli pv. gladioli (formerly Pseudomonas gladioli pv. gladioli), a bacterium. Unlike other gladiolus corm rot diseases, scab does not kill the affected plants. Unless very severely affected, corms produce normal flower spikes. The bacteria are widespread and may be introduced into a planting on infected corms or may have survived from a previous planting. Insect feeding wounds, such as those from bulb mites, may serve as infection sites.


","Shallow black surface lesions develop on the corms. Typical scab lesions are sunken, have a definite rim, and have a hard, shiny black layer over the surface of the lesion. Lesions are more numerous at the base of the affected corm; in contrast, Stromatinia lesions are more numerous on the upper portion of affected corms, particularly in the leaf scar region.


","

1) Plant only scab-free corms.

Gladiolus,Botrytis Leaf and Flower Spot and Corm Rot,"Botrytis gladiolorum, and possibly B. cinerea, fungi. They survive in soil as sclerotia and as mycelium on plant debris. The leaf and flower spot phase of the disease is most prevalent in northern Washington, where weather often favors fungal buildup on flowers and old foliage late in the season. High humidity and leaf wetness are needed for infection and sporulation. Usually, infection is too late to seriously interfere with the plant's growth and development; however, spores may wash down to the corms or spread to the corms during digging time to cause serious losses from corm rots. Latent infections may cause significant postharvest losses when in transit to market.


","A vareity of leaf and flower spots. Leaves develop large, round-to-oval brown spots, smaller pale brown spots with red-brown margins, and very small rusty-brown spots that usually show on the leaf's exposed side. Flowers develop pale brown, then dark-brown spots on the flower stem. Soft rotting at bases of florets may follow heavy rain. At first, petals develop translucent water-soaked spots. As petal spots enlarge, dead tissue turns light brown. Under moist conditions the whole flower becomes slimy with rot.
Corm rot-tan to light brown rotted areas that are wet or spongy. Rot may start at the base and spread from the core through the corm or may start at any point on the corm.

Gladiolus,Fusarium Yellows and Corm Rots,"Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. gladioli, a soilborne fungus that survives in soil and plant debris for many years as chlamydospores. It can survive in the absence of gladiolus for many years. Population levels are highest in the top 8-inches of soil and the disease is favored by high soil temperatures. Spores infect roots then mycelia travels up the roots and crosses the basal plate. The fungus in these infections may continue to enter and spread within the vascular tissues. The fungus is spread widely by contaminated soil and infected corms while local spread can be by water flow and rain splash. Excess nitrogen fertility may favor the disease. There may be several types or stains of the fungus as isolates from gladiolus may infect iris but isolates from iris may or may not infect gladiolus.


","Reduced plant growth, stunting and yellow leaves are observed above ground. Yellowing increases until the plant dies. The roots are killed and become dark brown or decay, dropping off when corms are lifted.Infected corms may have dark brown, circular, rotting areas on the side or top; a shallow, dark brown basal rot; or only a light discoloration of conducting tissues above the basal plate. A dry corm rot may develop in storage if corms have not matured properly or are not cured soon after digging.


","Sanitation is important to focus on while integrating many other tactics.

1) Select clean planting stock and discard all diseased corms. Corms grown from cormels in clean soil usually are healthier than corms grown from corms.

2) Plant in clean, well drained soil.

3) Use a 4-year rotation.

4) Avoid excessive nitrogen fertility.

5) Cure corms quickly after digging. Best results are from curing 48 hours at 95°F, turning corms once after 24 hours and cir-culating the air at 200 cu ft/min. Results were good at lower temperatures, but more time was required. Hold corms for 5 days at 80°F and for 2 weeks at 70°F to cure corms to the same extent.

6) Store at temperatures of 50°F or less, discarding all diseased corms before storing.

7) It has been suggested that keeping the soil pH between 6.6 and 7.0 and utilizing nitrate forms of nitrogen may be helpful.

","Remove disease bulbs and soak clean bulbs for 15 to 30 min within 48 hours after digging. Research in India suggests that fungicides may be more effective when used at a low pH (3.0); however, this has not been confirmed in the PNW.

Gladiolus,Mild Mosaic,"Bean yellow mosaic virus is spread by aphids. Transmission can also occur with tools used for harvesting flowers and corms. Beans and other legumes are susceptible. The virus can overwinter in perennial legumes such as alfalfa, clovers or vetch. Almost all gladiolus cultivars are infected and should not be planted close to beans or other legume crops. Mixed infections with Cucumber mosaic virus produce more severe symptoms.


","Generally symptomless or with mild symptoms. Slight dark-to-light-green mottling of leaves, often difficult to detect, early in the summer. Flowers show a variegated white mottling. Also described as faint, inconspicuous pencil-striped break patterns that are lighter in color than the normal flower color. High temperature conditions can mask symptom expression.


","

1) Use new seedling cultivars that have been tested and found to be free of all known viruses.

2) Do not plant gladiolus next to beans, clover, or other legumes.

3) Control aphids. See  for details.

4) Grow plants under fine mesh nets.

5) Prevent contaminating stock plants by disinfecting cutting knives and other tools frequently. Soak tools 60 sec in 10% bleach (Clorox), or shellac thinner (70% ethyl alcohol), or quaternary ammonium (Physan 20).

6) Remove and destroy symptomatic plants.

Gladiolus,"Nematode, Root-knot","Meloidogyne hapla, root-knot nematodes, are sedentary endoparasites, where only second-stage juveniles (infective stage) and adult males (may be rare) are in soil.


","During the growing season, knots develop on roots. Nematodes also can be found in tissue inside the corm above the basal plate. Necrotic areas may indicate their presence. The nematode's location below the corm surface makes it difficult to select nematode-free corms and can be a source of infestation of nematode-free soils and other host plants.

Gladiolus,Stromatinia Neck Rot and Corm Rot,"Stromatinia gladioli, a soilborne fungus that survives in soil indefinitely (> 10 years). Sclerotia germinate in response to nearby gladiolus roots. Other hosts include Crocosmia, Crocus, and Freesia. Daffodil, iris, hyacinth and tulip are not hosts. The fungus enters leaves at or near the ground line and causes a dry rot of leaves and stem, which may kill the plant. Wounds are not required for infection. The disease is favored by cool, wet conditions, and wet soils. Often, secondary organisms enter the infected stem at ground level, causing a wet or slimy appearance. The neck-rot phase of the disease occurs primarily in early summer. Young corms tend to be more susceptible than older ones.


","Symptoms are similar to those of Fusarium yellows. Older leaves become partially yellow and dry; eventually all the leaves become dry and dead. The part of the leaf in soil shows a dry rot, and tiny black fungal sclerotia develop on the dead areas.
Corm infections result in a dry rot and usually do not completely break down corms as with Botrytis and Fusarium rots. Instead, dark surface lesions develop, most abundantly along old leaf scars. Infected areas usually do not extend far into the corm's flesh. Black sclerotia may also be observed in rotted cortical tissue of the roots.


","

1) Select pathogen-free corms.

2) If possible, plant in soil not previously planted to gladiolus.

3) Plant in clean, well drained soil.

4) Use a long 4-year rotation.

5) Remove volunteer plants that occur in areas previously planted to gladiolus.

","Effective (highly toxic) chemicals used in the past are no longer available for use.

Gladiolus,White Break,"Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV), subgroup I, spread by aphids. The source of CMV infection is previously infected gladiolus, in which corms maintain the virus during dormancy and then produce infected leaves each season upon which aphids feed. CMV, however, can infect over 1,200 plant species including important agronomic crops. The mode of aphid transmission is nonpersistent or stylet-borne. Although the virus is mechanically transmitted in many other crop systems it is not generally transmitted this way in gladiolus. Mixed infections with Bean yellow mosaic virus produce more severe symptoms.


","Cultivars differ in symptom expression but are generally symptomless until flowering. The most striking symptoms are in flowers but may not be apparent at cutting time. Most common is color breaking (spotting or streaking) on florets. The degree of breaking depends on the cultivar affected. Spots or streaks, |always lighter than normal color, are usually white, grayish, light green, or yellow-green. Florets may change color, sometimes accompanied by reduced size, thickened petals, and twisted and deformed florets. Also, hue may change from normal to lighter. Gray or yellowish green streaking or flecking can occur on leaves. On some cultivars, the gray or yellowish green spots are small and numerous. Stunting of the plants is often associated with severely affected leaves. Sometimes diseased plants produce warty or deformed corms.


","

1) Use new seedling cultivars that have been tested and found to be free of all known viruses.

2) Plant pathogen-free corms.

3) Rogue affected plants thoroughly and persistently.

4) Control aphids. See  for details.

5) Grow plants under fine mesh nets.

Gloxinia,Botrytis Blight,"Botrytis cinerea, a fungus that colonizes dead, dying, and wounded plant parts. From these infections they can attack healthy tissues. A moist, humid environment is ideal for the pathogen's sporulation and spread. Conidia may come from sources in and outside the greenhouse. The fungus is found everywhere plants are grown and has a wide host range. Flower petals are most susceptible at any stage of development. Frequently colonizes flowers already compromised by other pathogens such as Sclerotinia.


","Small water-soaked lesions form on damaged petioles and spread to leaf blades. Infected flowers fade prematurely. By comparison to Sclerotinia, Botrytis lesions were not as wet and did not cause the complete collapse of flowers.


","

1) Remove all dead and dying plant parts (particularly blossoms) on and around plants.

2) Maintain a relatively dry environment by keeping greenhouse humidity below 90%, increasing spacing between plants for good air circulation, and taking care not to splash water on foliage during watering. Heating the greenhouse at night or venting around sunset may be necessary.

3) Spacing plants also allows better light penetration, reducing senescence of the lower leaves and thus helping reduce the amount of highly susceptible plant tissue.

4) Place fans in greenhouse to get better air circulation.

Gooseberry and Currant ,(Ribes spp.)-Armillaria Root Rot,,,,,
Gooseberry and Currant ,(Ribes spp.)-Blister Rust,"Cronartium ribicola, a fungus that attacks both wild and cultivated species of gooseberry and currant. Black currant (Ribes nigrum) is more susceptible than red currant (R. sativum). Red currant cultivars Viking and Red Dutch are practically immune. The wild species stink currant (R. bracteosum), flowering currant (R. sanguineum), Sierra gooseberry (R. roezli), and Sierra currant (R. nevadense) are very susceptible. The white or five-needled pine is an alternate host for the fungus. Rust of white pine has caused severe losses. Susceptible currants and gooseberries cannot be planted safely nearer than 1000 ft and preferably 0.5 mile from white pine. Ribes and white pines are adapted to disturbance and frequently co-occur in forest and woodland ecosystems.
In spring, spores form in orange pustules (aecia) on tree cankers. Wind distributes aeciospores to currants and gooseberries. Leaves increase in susceptibility as they expand, most susceptible when fully expanded and then decreasing in susceptibility as they age. Uredinia form on the underside of these Ribes hosts and produce urediniospores. The urediniospores can only reinfect more Ribes hosts and continue to do so during the rest of the growing season. Rainfall and long wet periods encourage infection and greater disease development on Ribes. Telia form in late summer where the uredinia are located. The teliospores are not dispersed but germinate to form another spore type called a basidiospore. These spores are blown to white pine, causing new infections. Pycnia appear on the bark the following spring. Aecia erupt from the same area where the pycnia formed the previous year. Aeciospores are produced perennially until the branch dies.


","On the undersurface of affected currant leaves, small cup-like spots (uredinia) develop. Spots are slightly raised and yellow-orange. Later in the growing season, brownish hair-like structures (telia) develop in the same or new lesions. Defoliation of infected hosts is common as the number of lesions increases.


","

1) Remove white (five-needled) pines within 1000 ft of planting.

2) Minimize fertilizer to just what is needed to grow the crop as excessive nitrogen encourages disease development.

Grape ,(Vitis spp.)-Armillaria Root Rot,"Armillaria mellea, a fungus, infects vine roots, killing the cambium and decaying the underlying xylem.  This is a soilborne fungus that is capable of attacking many different plant hosts. These fungi are most commonly found in forests and natural areas where they infect a variety of trees and shrubs. Therefore, the disease is most common in newly established fields that are planted on land recently cleared of native vegetation.
This fungus may form mushrooms at the base of infected vines in fall and winter. Mushrooms produce wind-blown spores, but these spores are not a significant means of infecting healthy vines. The fungus spreads vegetatively, below ground, which leads to the formation of groups of dead and dying plants called ""disease centers."" The fungus can survive on woody host roots long after the host dies. Its vegetative fungal tissue (mycelium) decomposes root wood for nutrients as it grows. When infected plants are removed, infected roots that remain below ground serve as a source of inoculum for vines planted in the same location.
Infection occurs when grape roots come in direct contact with partially decayed tree roots and are colonized by mycelium. Infection can also occur when grape roots contact rhizomorphs (black, shoestring-like fungal structures) that grow out from partially decayed roots and through the soil. Once vine roots are infected, whether they are living or dead, they serve as a source of inoculum for neighboring vines. The infection process takes months to happen. Spread between neighboring vines may take more than 10 years to occur. The disease negatively affects vine mineral-nutrition status and fruit quality.


","Mildly symptomatic grapevines are distinguishable from healthy grapevines only by having shorter canes. Severely symptomatic grapevines not only have shorter canes, but their leaves are dwarfed and may be chlorotic. Wilting, premature defoliation, and shriveling of berries also occurs. Symptoms worsen each year until the vine dies over the winter or shortly after bud break. Diagnostic mycelial fans can be observed beneath the bark of the root crown of infected plants. Dig down about a foot below the soil line and use a pocketknife to remove thin layers of bark from the root collar. Mycelial fans are thick, white layers of fungus that adhere to the inner root bark and/or the wood beneath the bark. Infected wood rots, loosing structural integrity. Armillaria also makes black, shoestring-like structures called rhizomorphs, which are occasionally found within the bark and/or extending into surrounding soil. Rhizomorphs may look like roots on the outside but have an entirely different structure when cut open in cross-section.


","

1) When clearing a new site of forest trees and shrubs or when clearing a site with infected plants (infection centers) there are several precautions to take.

1.1) Girdle large trees before removal to hasten decay of roots.
1.2) After removing aboveground vegetation, clear soil of stumps and large roots. Deep-rip the soil in more than one direction to bring large roots to the soil surface. If possible, remove all roots greater than 1 inch in diameter from the soil.
1.3) Burn all woody debris.
1.4) Leave this ground fallow at least 1 year.
2) If using drip irrigation, move drip-line emitters away from the trunk and in between trees after first year of planting.

3) Permanently removing soil in a 3-ft radius around the crown and main trunk root area has been effective in California and may be of benefit for managing infected vines in the Pacific Northwest. Be sure to keep root collars free of soil, especially in vineyards with high gopher populations.

4) Remove and destroy severely infected vines, being careful to remove as much root material as possible from soil. If practical, do not replant where infected vines have been removed.

","Although preplant fumigation is effective under the right soil conditions, the best materials are no longer available. Post-plant pesticide applications are not effective including soil fumigation or trunk injections.

Grape ,(Vitis spp.)-Black Foot Disease,"Cylindrocarpon and Cylindrocarpon-like fungi are involved with this disease of young vines. C. destructans, previously identified as the cause in California and elsewhere in the world, has been found to be a species complex. There are now 18 fungal species associated with this disease. The species associated with black foot disease is now known as C. liriodendri (sexual: Neonectria liriodendri). In the PNW, Ilyonectria destructans (formerly C. destructans) and Neonectria obtusispora (formerly C. obtusisporum) have been found in association with declining young vines, but the disease has not been thoroughly investigated. Surveys in British Columbia found 5 fungal species associated with this disease; Ilyonectria liriodendri and I. macrodidyma were the most prevalent.
Vines are predisposed to the pathogenic phase of these fungi by stress, in particular water stress. Blocked xylem vessels accentuate the water stress and lead to insufficient water and nutrient supply. This leads to symptom expression, which usually occurs during periods of high water demand. Environmental factors and host stress such as malnutrition, poor drainage, soil compaction, heavy crop loads on young plants, planting of vines in poorly prepared soil, and improper planting holes also play an important part in the development of these diseases.
Vines derived from infected mother plants are thought to be significant sources of infected plants. Cylindrocarpon invades through wounds or natural openings. Poor cold storage and transport conditions of nursery stock can also result in stress and cross-contamination. Vineyard soils are naturally infested with the pathogen and are thought to be a more important source of inoculum.
These root diseases have been found infrequently in the Pacific Northwest. It is likely that these pathogens are and have been in Northwest soils for many years. The widespread planting of new vines and rootstocks during the 1990s has increased awareness of these problems. In general, many other problems have been associated with declining vines including wet soils, ""J""-rooted vines, root girdling, graft failure, crown gall, gopher damage, early fruit load, and water stress. The latter two conditions seem to favor both black foot disease and young esca.


","Young vines generally appear normal at planting, but differences in vigor become marked including reduced caliper size of the trunk, shortened internodes, reduced foliage, and reduced leaf size. The first 3 to 5 years after planting, onset of foliar symptoms may appear as severe leaf scorching, followed by necrosis and early defoliation. Wilting and dieback may also occur. Below ground, symptoms include reduced total root biomass, reduced numbers of feeder roots, and sunken, necrotic root lesions. Uneven wood maturity, usually associated with rapid desiccation, is another common symptom.
Viewing trunks of declining grapevines in cross-section, dark brown to black streaking is evident in the vascular elements due to plugging of individual or aggregates of xylem vessels with amber to black gum (gummosis) and formation of tyloses. Necrosis extending from the bark to the pith is characteristic of black foot disease.
Physical injuries to the grapevine due to root tearing, disbudding, or other trauma during production or planting can result in phenolic depositions and black discoloration, or even outright death of tissue as the result of injury to cambium tissues.
Symptoms of young vine decline resemble other important diseases of grape including uneven wood maturity as in Pierce's disease, virus-induced incompatibility, esca or black measles, and some nutrient deficiencies.


","Good management techniques, which include proper planting, irrigation, and fertility for young vines while avoiding devigorating stresses, both before and after planting, are very important for establishing a healthy and productive vineyard.

1) When planting, sort out vines of poor quality. Do not plant vines that have been rooted from a curved cane (J-rooted), have weak or spindly growth or obvious problems such as crown gall. If you must use these kinds of vines, then cluster them in rows where they can be monitored in future years.

2) Delay fruiting for several years until vines have balanced root and shoot growth. Cropping several tons in the second year after planting has been associated with these diseases.

3) Using grow tubes also has been associated with these diseases. It is suspected that grow tubes cause the vines to produce more shoot growth than root growth.

4) Plant new vineyards in spring or fall when water is not a limiting factor. Irrigate new plantings for a few years before switching to dryland production.

5) Soak dormant cuttings 30 min. in hot water (122°F or 50°C). This has not always been effective and must be combined with other methods.

6) Strict sanitation and protection of all wounds from pruning to grafting will help protect vines during nursery production.

7) Immediately after grafting, nurseries should dip vines into specialized waxes containing plant growth regulators or fungicide-impregnated formulations, which encourage graft union callus development while inhibiting fungal contamination.

","Chemical strategies to control these pathogens are difficult, as traditional techniques used for the control of surface pathogens do not penetrate dormant grapevine cuttings sufficiently to control fungi inhabiting the vascular system. Soaking infected dormant cuttings or vines in fungicides before grafting or planting has reduced disease incidence and severity but none are registered for this use.


","Use in conjunction with other control tactics such as thorough sanitation. Trichoderma sp. have been shown to help protect pruning wounds, basal ends of propagation material and graft unions before infection.


1) RootShield Granules (Rifai strain T-22) at various rates depending on the specific use. For example, use 1 to 1.5 lb/ cubic yard soil mix or 1000 sq ft before nursery planting. Zero reentry interval.

2) Bio-Tam 2.0 or Tenet WP ( and ) at 0.5 to 1.5 lb/cubic yard of substrate. See label for details and other application methods. May take a few weeks after application to be effective. 4-hr reentry unless soil incorporated.

"
Grape ,(Vitis spp.)-Blackleaf,"Unknown. A leaf discoloration known as blackleaf, brownleaf, chocolate leaf, or blattbraune is a problem in eastern Washington. Blackleaf is associated with potassium deficiency, severe overcropping, poor soils, sun exposure, drought, and/or high summer temperatures. Whether these factors are directly responsible for blackleaf or merely correlative with symptom expression is unknown. Blackleaf is particularly noticeable in Vitis labrusca cultivars such as Concord. It has a negative impact on fruit ripening and quality.
Development of blackleaf and classic potassium deficiency appear to be independent. Applying potassium fertilizer has increased leaf tissue potassium content but only partially alleviated blackleaf symptoms.
Research on 'Concord' grapevines indicates excessive sunlight initiates blackleaf symptoms. Prolonged exposure to certain light levels causes dysfunction of photosynthesis and symptom development. Reducing either total sunlight or the ultraviolet component transmitted to the canopy decreased symptom development. Water deficit stress at any time during the growing season increased blackleaf development.


","Symptoms usually appear near veraison. A discoloration of the mesophyll tissue (browning) is followed by a reddish-brown, blue-violet, or black discoloration of dots, flecks, or streaks within the upper epidermis. The discolored areas expand to cover over 50% of the leaf surface. Only the parts of leaves of the outer canopy that are fully exposed to sunlight develop symptoms. In severe cases, the entire sun-exposed leaf area becomes black and chlorotic, resulting in premature defoliation.
Classic potassium deficiency symptoms usually occur shortly after fruit-set in leaves at the midshoot position and are characterized by chlorosis originating at leaf margins and progressing to interveinal regions of the leaf. Unlike potassium deficiency injury, blackleaf has no particular pattern of origination within the leaf.


","

1) Fertilize according to soil or tissue test results. Do not add excess potassium.

2) Maintain adequate moisture above the permanent wilting point but below field capacity. Minimize drought stress especially early in the growing season for 'Concord'.

","The use of sun-blocking compounds is recommended for areas with a perennial problem.


1) Surround WP at 25 lb/50 gallons water/A. A dry white film will result on all treated plant parts and may be a problem for wine grapes after verasion. 4-hr reentry.

Grape ,(Vitis spp.)-Botryosphaeria Dieback,"Various members of several fungal families cause trunk diseases in grapevines, and multiple pathogens may be isolated from an affected vine. Symptoms are not sufficient to identify a particular cause. Trunk diseases should be considered a syndrome or disease complex potentially involving members of the Botryosphaeriaceae, Diatrypaceae (such as Eutypa), and Togniniaceae (Phaeacremonium, Phaeomoniella), which have been found in association with diseased grapevines in Oregon. Members of the Botryosphaeriaceae, including multiple species of the fungus Botryosphaeria, are known to cause a range of symptoms, which have also been referred to as excoriose or ""Bot canker."" These fungi cause perennial cankers and enter vines through fresh injuries such as natural cracks, pruning wounds, or any large cut to cordons or trunks. Spores are released from pycnidia on diseased vines during rain or overhead irrigation. Spores can germinate in a fresh wound when temperatures are above 5°C (41°F). Fresh wounds are more susceptible to spore infection than older cuts. Pruning wounds made early in the dormant period are much more susceptible than wounds made late in the dormant period. These fungi become established in the vine slowly growing toward the roots. Symptoms are generally not noticed until year 8 when disease incidence is about 10% but yield losses are to this point minor. Increasing losses occur from reduced vine productivity, poor yields and extra costs for cultural and chemical management.
The extent of diseases due to the Botryosphaeriaceae in the Pacific Northwest is unknown. B. dothidea, B. quercuum, and Diplodia mutila (formerly B. stevensii) have been found in grapevines in Oregon, and Neofusicoccum parvum (formerly B. parva) and B. dothidea have been found in Okanagan vineyards in British Columbia. Disease due to the Botryosphariaceae is likely to have been overlooked, as symptoms are similar to those caused by Eutypa.
Spread is thought to be by movement of spores from within an infected vineyard, rather than from sources outside of it. Spores, produced in pycnidia in infected vines and on prunings left behind, are spread by water splash up to 6-ft away. Vines as young as five years old may be affected. Water stress will exacerbate the severity of symptoms.


","In cross section, older vines will show wedge-shaped cankers in the trunk and cordons, similar to those caused by Eutypa. On spur-pruned vines, infected spurs may not grow in the spring, or there may be growth followed by rapid wilt and collapse of the foliage. Some spurs may be dead, while others on the same cordon may produce apparently healthy foliage. In California, there are no foliar symptoms apparent on plants that have been infected by various species of Botryosphaeria. This is in contrast to Eutypa, which produces stunted spring growth and yellowed leaves. Young vines may show cankers, vascular discoloration, or dark streaking of the xylem.


","

1) In spring, when symptoms are evident, mark diseased vines for future removal.

2) Prune hard well below the visible canker. Remove diseased wood 4 to 6 inches below discolored vascular tissue, and train a new, healthy shoot into position.

3) If the canker is below ground, remove and replace the vine.

4) Avoid large pruning cuts when possible, and avoid pruning during and before wet weather. Prune later in the dormant period.

5) When making large cuts during wet weather, leave a stub several inches long to be pruned off later during dry weather. Sometimes referred to as double pruning.

6) Remove and destroy all large trunk or cordon pieces from the vineyard.

7) Grow less susceptible cultivars such as Chardonnay.

8) Supplemental irrigation may help manage symptom severity.

9) Treating pruning wounds with sealants or paints has been effective when used within 24 hours of a pruning cut. These products include B-Lock, Spur Shield, or Vitiseal. See labels for details.

","Useful when retraining vines and making large trunk or cordon cuts.

"
Grape ,(Vitis spp.)-Botrytis Bunch Rot,"This disease is common on the west side of the Cascade Range but a sporadic problem in the arid viticulture regions of the PNW.
Many fungal and bacterial organisms, of which Botrytis cinerea is the most important, can infect grapes and result in a bunch rot. Botrytis cinerea has a large host range and grows and sporulates on most of them. The fungus overwinters and oversummers as black sclerotia on old cluster stems, canes, and mummified grapes. Spores spread by wind. Young, succulent shoots can be infected in spring, especially if injured by hail.
Flower parts frequently are infected and can serve as a source of the fungus within the developing cluster. Inflorescences are susceptible to infection at the start of flowering through fruit set. Wet weather favors infection and disease development, especially near harvest when canopies are dense and berries accumulate sugar. Botrytis cinerea will infect grape berries from 53°F to 86°F with as little as 4 hours of berry wetness. The number of berries infected; however, rises as hours of berry wetness increases. The fungus can quickly spread from berry to berry within ripening bunches and can develop readily on wounded or split berries.
Removal of leaves adjacent to clusters aids management of both bunch rot and powdery mildew. The microclimate becomes less favorable for disease development and clusters are covered better with fungicide. Exact timing of leaf removal will depend on geography and vineyard management. Chance of sunburn increases the later leaves are removed and during extreme heat events.
'Cabernet Sauvignon' is one of the least susceptible wine grape grown in Oregon. 'Gewurtztraminer' is less susceptible than 'Chardonnay', 'Pinot Noir', and 'Riesling'. Bunches that are more tight or compact are at higher risk of the disease.
Under certain environmental conditions, white grapes infected solely by B. cinerea may develop a special rot known as noble rot. These grapes can be used to produce a special, very sweet wine.


","Young shoots and leaves may be infected in spring and develop brown, water-soaked areas. These areas generally girdle the shoot, causing it to wilt and die back. The characteristic gray fungal growth may or may not be present.
Generally, rotted berries appear in late summer and autumn as small, brown spots on maturing berries. The berry skin may slip off easily when rubbed. Later, characteristic tufts of gray fungal growth appear on the surface of infected berries. Often, rotted berries are near the center of the bunch. The rot then spreads quickly and may encompass most of the bunch. Other organisms may invade the berries later, producing a large variety of colors, smells, and tastes. Occasionally, immature berries may develop a soft brown rot early in summer.


","

1) Remove leaves adjacent to clusters at fruit set (BBCH 71) to pea-sized (BBCH 75) stage, which also aids in spray penetration and coverage. Removing leaves before BBCH 71 may decrease fruit set and yield, and after BBCH 75 may be ineffective for  control. Avoid sunburn by removing only the morning-sun side (east or north) of the canopy. Earlier and more leaf removal may be required for vigorous vines with dense canopies.

2) Use an appropriate trellising system to increase aeration and sun exposure.

3) Avoid excessive vegetative growth through rootstock selection and management, irrigation management, and judicious use of nitrogen fertilizer.

4) If adjusting yields by dropping fruit, consider removal of clusters that are in contact with other clusters.

5) Manage powdery mildew as it predisposes berries to infection through the establishment of microscopic wounds on the fruit surface.

6) Select varietal clones with loose cluster architecture.

","Spray during bloom and beginning of fruit set (BBCH 60 to 69), just before berry touch (BBCH 77), start of veraison (BBCH 81), and 3 weeks prior to harvest before rain is expected. Focus more on applications before rain storms rather than at vine growth stage. Fungal strains resistant to site specific chemicals can develop quickly. To delay or prevent building up resistant fungi, tank-mix products from different groups with different modes of action. Also, limit applications from any specific group to two (2) or fewer sprays.

Grape ,(Vitis spp.)-Cane and Leaf Spot,"Diaporthe ampelina (formerly Phomopsis viticola), a fungus. The disease has been found sporadically in vineyards west of the Cascade Range. The fungus overwinters in last year's cane growth. Fruiting bodies of the fungus (pycnidia) develop in the periderm and produce many spores in the spring. These spores are exuded during rain events when the bark is wet. Spores are then rain splashed to developing shoots. Warm temperatures during long wet periods favor infection. About 10 hours of shoot wetness is required for light infections at 50°F. Young, rapidly growing tissues are most susceptible. Cluster rachis lesions are associated with the most consistent cause of economic loss. This same fungus has been found infrequently as a trunk pathogen but the connection between cane symptoms and trunk decay is unknown.
The more susceptible cultivars include Grenache, Flame Tokay, and Thompson Seedless. Under high inoculum cultivars Colombard, Cabernet Sauvignon, and Petit Verdot may show symptoms as well. Other cultivars are less susceptible.


","In the dormant season, infected canes may become bleached, and numerous black fruiting bodies (pycnidia) may develop all along the cane's basal region. This is the most common symptom in the Pacific Northwest; however, other nonpathogenic fungi can cause similar cane bleaching. Susceptible cultivars may show elongate lesions on the cane's basal internodes. Small leaf spots also can occur early in leaf development, which can severely crinkle or misshape the leaf. Leaf petioles and cluster rachises also can develop lesions in severe years. Fruit rot has not been observed in the Pacific Northwest on vines grown for wine.
This same fungus has also been found infrequently as a trunk pathogen causing cankers, interior wood discoloration, poor vigor, and die-back. Historically, the disease was called Dead Arm.

Grape ,(Vitis spp.)-Chemical Injury,"Several classes of herbicides and pesticides can cause damage to grapevines. Some of the most damaging chemicals are 2,4-D herbicides. Grapes are very sensitive and frequently are damaged by chemical drift from nearby applications. Grapes are most sensitive from bud break through bloom but can become damaged anytime during the growing season. The ester form, commercially available as Crossbow, Brush Killer, and other trade names, is more volatile than the amine form. Common uses of 2,4-D esters are blackberry and brush control and broadleaf weed control in grass seed fields. On warm days, the herbicide can volatilize from sprayed areas and move several miles downwind.
Other herbicides that are damaging include Dicamba, Glyphosate, Sulfonylurea, Imidazolinone and others. The most damaging time for herbicide drift is from budbreak to fruit set. Significant exposure to these herbicides can cause fruit deformation and potential crop loss, depending on the timing and intensity of the herbicide drift.
Sulfur products used for powdery mildew control can burn foliage when applied above 85°F. The temperature relationship is correlated with increases in the daily maximum, within a few days after application. Grapes in California can withstand sulfur applications (at lower rates) above 85°F if there are no major short-term changes in the daily maximum. Once vines are acclimated to higher temperatures the chance of burn is greatly reduced. Some grapes, such as labrusca types like 'Concord' and interspecific hybrids, are genetically sensitive to sulfur even at low temperatures. Application of horticultural oils too close to sulfur applications can also damage grape leaves.


","Leaves affected by 2,4-D herbicides have a distinctive fan-shape appearance with parallel, strap-like veins. These veins are clear and terminate in sharp points at the leaf margin. (Kind of reminds some folks of chicken feet.) Small, puckered, interveinal spots retain some green chlorophyll. In severe cases, clusters shrivel up. Can take up to 3 years to recover.
Sulfur burn appears first as a bleaching between the veins. These turn brown, necrotic and dry out becoming brittle. Defoliation may occur. Injured fruit can develop brown to black scar tissue.


","

1) Talk to neighbors within a half-mile radius of the vineyard and advise them about the sensitivity of grapevines to herbicide drift. If possible, encourage them not to use the more volatile forms of 2,4-D. Be aware of potential drift from highway department sprays or those that may occur at parks or substations.

2) Use lower rates of sulfur when the daily maximum is expected to increase significantly within the next few days. Make applications during the cooler, early morning hours.

Grape ,(Vitis spp.)-Crown Gall,"Agrobacterium vitis (which may also be called Rhizobium vitis), a bacterium that attacks only grape and chrysanthemum. Crown gall is most commonly found in regions with cold winters like southern Oregon and areas east of the Cascade Range. The bacterium survives for years in old galls, infected vines, and infected plant debris in the soil. It can enter the plant through wounds, such as grafting wounds, mechanical or cold damage, or pruning cuts. More often than not, the bacterium has already infected the vascular tissues of symptomless grapevines. The bacteria are systemic within the vine and may also have an epiphytic phase on green shoots including shoot tips and meristems. Despite this the bacteria are not found uniformly on or throughout the vine. Roots may provide a nitch for survival in the soil.
This bacteria is a genetic engineer that modifies the grapevine to make it a home and produce a food source. Winter damage that causes minor wounds can trigger the infection process. After the bacterium enters a wound, a small piece of its DNA is transferred into the plant's DNA. The foreign DNA transforms normal plant cells in the wounded area into tumor cells. Once transformed, tumor cells proliferate automatically and produce unique substances that the bacteria can use readily as a food source. The result is a gall, a disorganized mass of hyperplastic and hypertrophic tissue. Crown gall is a greater problem on grafted vines than own-rooted vines as the graft union can result in active gall growth even without winter freezes or mechanical damage. Necrosis in the graft union can inhibit graft take. Grape production can drop by 40% on affected vines. Crown gall is also a greater problem on younger vines with a smaller circumference.


","Fleshy, hard galls are typically found midsummer on the trunk, located at the root crown and on the first 2 ft of the vine above the soil line. Large galls may develop rapidly and completely girdle young vines in one season. Galls may also be numerous at or near graft unions. The galls turn brown by late summer then become dry and corky. After 1 or 2 years, dead galls may flake off the vine. Galled vines generally produce poor shoot growth, and vine portions above the galls may wilt, become chlorotic, and die due to the gall blockage. Infection of young vines may result in stunting and reduced productivity especially in the first two years after planting. Few clusters develop on these shoots and if fruit does form, it often shrivels or will not ripen. Galls are rarely seen on roots but the bacterium may cause areas of dark necrotic lesions on the roots.


","Cultural management tactics to reduce or eliminate crown gall include planting crown gall-free vines, preventing vine injury, and removing diseased tissue or vines. Regular monitoring then replacement or renewal helps minimize the impact of this disease.

1) Growers can purchase crown gall-tested vines from several nurseries. The Clean Plant Center Northwest-Grapes Program in Washington produces vines tested for the crown gall bacteria and other plant pathogens and makes those certified vines available to nurseries to propagate. See:

2) Soak dormant cuttings 30 min in hot water at 129°F (50°F to 54°C, more bud death as temp increases) to help eliminate most of the bacteria. Primary buds are killed, but secondary buds should grow well. Some cultivars may be more sensitive than others. Disinfect grafting equipment often.

3) Resistant rootstocks are available but grafting will not allow for retraining of vines after severe winter cold damage. Rootstock 3309 is more resistant to gall formation.

4) Choose a vineyard location where rapid temperature changes in the fall and spring are not common.

5) Use wind machines to raise surface air temperature during winter temperature inversions.

6) Avoid any injury near the base of the vine.

7) Remove diseased vines including as much old root material as possible from the vineyard. Sterilize pruning tools between vines with 10% Clorox (bleach, which also will oxidize your pruning equipment) or shellac thinner (70% ethyl alcohol).

8) If the gall is high enough on the trunk, a sucker replacement may be brought up from well below the galled areas in nongrafted plants.

9) Use a multiple trunk training system, which may allow for trunk replacement without losing an entire vine.

10) Do not graft over to a new cultivar on vines that are exhibiting crown gall.

11) Prevent late season vigorous growth through water and/or fertility management.

","The efficacy of chemicals such as copper-based compounds, other chemicals and antibiotics is not satisfactory and thus not recommended.


1) Gallex (ready to use) painted on very young galls to reduce further development. Galls may return the next year or if treated late, may continue to develop. Tissue surrounding the gall may be injured especially on younger plants. Prepare the surface by removing soil from around the galled area, and allow the area to dry before applying. Not generally recommended for use because it is often too labor- and time-intensive to apply. . 24-hr reentry.

","Agrobacterium radiobacter K84 (Galltrol) is ineffective since it does not prevent infections. O Nonpathogenic Agrobacterium vitis strain ARK-1, A. vitis strain F2/5 and others have been shown to be effective but are not commercially available. Use of nontumorgentic A. vitis strain F2/5 with a knocked out gene has been shown to prevent root necrosis by blocking the infection process. These various strains could be used to prevent infection during grafting.


"
Grape ,(Vitis spp.)-Downy Mildew,"The fungus-like organism Plasmopara viticola has not been reported from grape in the Pacific Northwest, but the disease has been reported from at least seven California counties. One OSU Plant Clinic specimen from a homeowner was diagnosed with downy mildew in 1966. Several clades (like forma species) of the fungus have been identified with P.v. clade aestivalis encountered the most in Eastern North America. The clade (also called Plasmopara muralis) found on Boston ivy or Virginia creeper does not infect grape and visa versa. The organism was detected on Boston ivy plants in Oregon in 2001. One landscape planting of Boston ivy without overhead irrigation had symptoms of the disease. This may indicate that western Oregon can sustain natural spread and expression of this disease.
Spring weather west of the Cascade Range would be highly conducive to disease development if the pathogen ever is introduced into grape vineyards. It can be spread by transporting infected vines or nursery stock or within plant debris or soil that contains oospores of the organism. The organism can overwinter or be transmitted as mycelium in dormant buds.


","Lesions can be on any green part of the vine. Lesions are yellowish and oily or angular, yellow to reddish brown, and limited by veins. In moist weather, a delicate dense, white growth is on the leaf underside opposite lesions seen on the upper side. Severely infected leaves drop, and vines may show premature defoliation. Shoot tips can die back; immature berries are highly susceptible. Symptoms may be easily confused with the grape erineum mite damage, which produces a puckered area with numerous white trichomes (that later turns darker) on the undersides of leaves.


","Quarantine and scouting are the best ways to keep it out of vineyards.

1) Do not transport infected stock into the region. Do not bring infected plant debris or soil into the region.

2) Scout vineyards for any sign of the disease. Check newly planted stock originating out of state. If it is suspected, get diseased plant samples to a public diagnostic laboratory as soon as possible to confirm the diagnosis.

3) Avoid overhead irrigation or practices that maintain wet foliage for extended periods of time.

","The Pacific Northwest does not have the disease in grapevines, so there is no need for chemical control applications.


",
Grape ,"(Vitis spp.)-Esca, Young Esca, and Petri Disease","Multiple species of Togninia (asexual: Phaeoacremonium)  and Phaeomoniella chlamydospora have been associated with these diseases, although the cause of esca continues to be disputed. Esca (black measles) is considered a disease of older vines, and in California Phaeoacremonium minimum, P. fraxinopennsylvanicum, and T. viticola (formerly P. viticola) are consistently associated with affected vines. Decline of young vines has been variously known as young vine decline, Petri disease, and young esca, with the fungus Phaeomoniella chlamydospora considered the primary pathogen. However, P. chlamydospora, Phaeoacremonium spp. and Togninia spp.  may be isolated from young (less than 7 years) and older plants. These fungi are considered endophytic, but have the ability to become severe pathogens as a result of poor cultural practices. In California, these fungi are widely distributed in vineyards aged 10-80 years old. Surveys in British Columbia found 7 fungal species associated with esca and petri diseases.
Vines are predisposed to the pathogens by stress, in particular water stress. Blocked xylem vessels accentuate the water stress and lead to insufficient water and nutrient supply. This leads to symptom expression, which usually occurs during periods of high water demand. Symptom severity on leaves is directly related to the symptom severity in the trunk. Environmental factors and host stress such as malnutrition, poor drainage, soil compaction, heavy crop loads on young plants, planting of vines in poorly prepared soil, and improper plant holes also play an important part in the development of these diseases. The production of fungal toxins that are then translocated to the leaves and berries may also be involved.
Vines derived from infected mother plants are considered a significant source of plants infected with young esca. Esca is considered to be the result of unprotected pruning wounds. In California, wounds from pruning have been found to remain susceptible to fungal colonization for up to 4 months after pruning, although most infection occurred during the first two months. In general, pruning wounds made early in the dormant period are much more susceptible than wounds made late in the dormant period. Poor cold storage and transport conditions of nursery stock can also result in stress and cross-contamination.
In general, many other problems have been associated with declining vines including ""J""-rooted vines, root girdling, graft failure, crown gall, gopher damage, early fruit load, and water stress. The latter two conditions seem to favor both black foot disease and young esca.


","Vine decline symptoms, caused by any of these pathogens, are indistinguishable and develop slowly in the first few seasons of vineyard establishment and production. Young vines generally appear normal at planting, but differences in vigor become marked: reduced caliper size of the trunk, shortened internodes, reduced foliage, and reduced leaf size. The first 3 to 5 years after planting, onset of foliar symptoms may appear as interveinal chlorosis, followed by necrosis and early defoliation. Wilting and shoot tip dieback may also occur. Uneven wood maturity, usually associated with rapid desiccation, is another common symptom. In older vines, affected leaves show a characteristic and severe interveinal chlorosis and necrosis, sometimes referred to as a ""tiger stripe"" pattern. Berries may show purple or brown spotting on the skin.
Viewing trunks of declining grapevines in cross-section, dark brown to black streaking is evident in the vascular elements due to plugging of individual or aggregates of xylem vessels with amber to black gum (gummosis) and formation of tyloses.
Black gumming in the vascular system may be present. Black or amber streaks in the vascular elements are deposits of phenolic compounds in response to wounding, a general plant defense mechanism. Physical injuries to the grapevine due to root tearing, disbudding, or other trauma during production or planting can result in phenolic depositions and black discoloration, or even outright death of tissue as the result of injury to cambium tissues.
Symptoms of decline in young vines resemble other important diseases of grape including uneven wood maturity as in Pierce's disease, virus-induced incompatibility, and some nutrient deficiencies.


","Good management techniques, which include proper planting, irrigation, and fertility for young vines while avoiding devigorating stresses, both before and after planting, are very important for establishing a healthy and productive vineyard.

1) When planting, sort out vines of poor quality. Do not plant vines that have been rooted from a curved cane (J-rooted), have weak or spindly growth or obvious problems such as crown gall. If you must use these kinds of vines, then cluster them in rows where they can be monitored in future years.

2) Delay fruiting for several years until vines have balanced root and shoot growth. Cropping several tons in the second year after planting has been associated with these diseases.

3) Using grow tubes also has been associated with these diseases. It is suspected that grow tubes cause the vines to produce more shoot growth than root growth.

4) Plant new vineyards in spring or fall when water is not a limiting factor. Irrigate new plantings for a few years before switching to dryland production.

5) Soak dormant cuttings 30 min. in hot water (122°F or 50°C). This has not always been effective and must be combined with other methods.

6) Strict sanitation and protection of all wounds from pruning to grafting will help protect vines during nursery production.

7) Immediately after grafting, nurseries should dip vines into specialized waxes containing plant growth regulators or fungicide-impregnated formulations, which encourage graft union callus development while inhibiting fungal contamination.

8) Avoid large pruning cuts when possible, and avoid pruning during and before wet weather. Prune later in the dormant period.

9) When making large cuts during wet weather, leave a stub several inches long to be pruned off later during dry weather. Sometimes referred to as double pruning.

10) Pruning wound treatments with sealants or paints have been effective when used within 24 hours of the pruning cut. These products include B-Lock, Spur Shield, or Vitiseal. See labels for details.

","Chemical strategies to control these pathogens are difficult, as traditional techniques used for the control of surface pathogens do not penetrate dormant grapevine cuttings sufficiently to control fungi inhabiting the vascular system. Soaking infected dormant cuttings or vines in fungicides before grafting or planting has reduced disease incidence and severity but none are registered for this use.


","Use in conjunction with other control tactics such as thorough sanitation. Trichoderma sp. have been shown to help protect pruning wounds, basal ends of propagation material, and graft unions before infection. Use within 24 hours of pruning and again in 2 weeks.


1) Bio-Tam 2.0 ( and T. gamsii) at 1 lb/A in 25 to 50 gal water plus a dye. May take a few weeks after application to be effective. 4-hr reentry.

"
Grape ,(Vitis spp.)-Eutypa Dieback,"The fungi Eutypa lata var. lata, has been found in all areas and E. laevata has been found in Washington The disease is prevalent on 'Concord' vines in eastern Washington but also on wine grapes throughout the PNW. Symptoms are generally not noticed until year 8 when disease incidence is about 10% but yield losses are, to this point, minor. Incidence is especially high in older vineyards where large pruning wounds were made to alter the training system. A brief preliminary survey found incidence high in non-irrigated vineyards containing old vines in southern Oregon. Moderately infected vineyards can lose 19% to 50% of yield, severely affected vineyards 62% to 94%. The disease has been observed more frequently on wine grapes in the Willamette Valley of Oregon. It is expected to increase as vineyards age and more acreage is planted. Also, the fungus can infect cherry trees, which are heavily planted within many of the same areas and can act as a reservoir of inoculum. The fungus can attack other hosts including many orchard crops such as Prunus spp., apples, pears, and walnuts and plants gown as ornamentals, or in riparian areas, such as big leaf maple, and willow.
Another species, E. leptoplaca, has been found in vineyards of northern California. Isolates of this fungus collected from California bay laurel and bigleaf maple trees adjacent to vineyards were found to cause disease in grapevines when inoculated. The incidence of E. leptoplaca in the PNW is unknown.
Ascospores are released from perithecia during rain events and may be carried long distances on air currents. Ascospores are discharged after 2 hours of rainfall and are released for 36 hours at which time perithecia are depleted of available ascospores. New mature ascospore are available for release after 12 more days. Infection occurs when airborne ascospores contact fresh pruning wounds during or immediately following rain. Pruning wounds become resistant to infection about 2 to 4 weeks after pruning. In general, pruning wounds made early in the dormant period are much more susceptible than wounds made late in the dormant period.
Cultivar susceptibility is dependent on various evaluation systems and high variability. On an unknown basis, it is said that Grenache is susceptible while Pinot Noir is tolerant. One study found the number of inoculated spurs to be 72% for Grenache and 47% for Pinot Noir but the rate of stain spread was significantly higher for Pinot Noir. Cabernet Sauvignon was similar to Pinot Noir and Merlot had the least number of spurs infected and lowest rate of stain spread. Differences in susceptibility may also be due to reaction of the foliage to translocated toxins.
In 2006, surveys in California found that many cankers were caused by several species of Botryosphaeria. This fungus may be more extensive and causing more of a problem than Eutypa. Similar surveys have not been done in Oregon. A survey of grape decline problems in British Columbia (Okanagan vineyards) found Botryosphaeria spp. in declining vineyards. Symptoms of these various fungal canker diseases are virtually the same. Fortunately, management tactics that work for Eutypa dieback will also work for Botryosphaeria cankers.


","Stunted spring shoot growth, yellowed and cupped newly emerged leaves, shed blossom clusters, vascular discoloration, and cankers in stems associated with old pruning wounds. In advanced stages, part or all of a vine dies. Symptoms are best seen in spring when healthy grapevine shoots are 10 to 15 inches long. Later in the season, affected shoots are stunted, and leaves become tattered and scorched. Clusters on infected shoots are poorly developed and often wither and drop. Infected vine foliage may be covered and masked by the foliage of healthy grapevines. Experience in Australia has shown that foliar symptoms may be variable from year to year, especially in 'Shiraz'. It is also common to find one side of a vine dead or with disease symptoms and the other side apparently healthy. Symptoms may not appear on diseased vines for more than 3 years after infection.
Cankers expand lengthwise in both directions from the wound and girdle and kill cordons or trunks of infected vines in 5 to 10 years. Removal of the bark will expose the extent of the canker. When cut in cross section, cankers may show wedge-shaped discoloration where the widest part is near the outside of the trunk or cordon and the thinnest part near the center. This symptom can be produced by several other wood decay fungi such as Phomopsis and/or Botryosphaeria dieback.


","

1) In spring, when symptoms are evident, mark diseased vines for future removal during dry weather.

2) Prune hard well below the visible canker. Remove diseased wood 4 to 6 inches below discolored vascular tissue, and train a new, healthy shoot into position.

3) Use a multiple trunk training system, which will allow for trunk replacement without losing an entire vine.

4) If the canker is below ground, remove and replace the vine.

5) Avoid large pruning cuts when possible, and avoid pruning during and before wet weather. Prune later in the dormant season.

6) When making large cuts during wet weather, leave a stub several inches long to be pruned off later during dry weather. Sometimes referred to as double pruning.

7) Remove and destroy all large trunk or cordon pieces from the vineyard.

8) Pruning wound treatments with sealants or paints have been effective when used within 24 hours of the pruning cut. These products include B-Lock, Spur Shield, or Vitiseal. See labels for details.

Grape ,(Vitis spp.)-Grapevine Red Blotch Disease,"This disease is caused by Grapevine red blotch virus (GRBV), which was first reported in 2012 from New York and subsequently in California, Washington, Oregon, Idaho, and elsewhere in the United States The discovery occurred when grapevines with red leaf symptoms that tested negative for Grapevine leafroll associated viruses (1-10) (GLRaV) were analyzed for possible new viruses. GRBV is the type member of the new Grablovirus genus, in the family Geminiviridae that is graft-transmissible. All grapevines entering Oregon and Washington must be certified free of the GRBV. It has been shown to be transmitted in the greenhouse by the three-cornered alfalfa hopper (Spissistilus festinus) ,and other potential vectors are being studied. The ODA has added GRBV to the quarantine pest list for grape at the wine grape industry's request.
Surveys in Idaho, Oregon and Washington vineyards have indicated the presence of this virus in many winegrape cultivars. Positive samples were collected from symptomatic grapevines of cultivars Merlot, Cabernet franc, Grenache, Pinot noir, Cabernet sauvignon, and Malbec. In addition, the samples of the white-fruited cultivars; Viognier, Chardonnay, Roussanne, Semillon and Pinot gris, which do not develop any red leaf symptoms were also identified in Oregon vineyards. Grapes tend to have multiple viruses at the same time so other symptoms may be present in positive vines. A survey in eastern Washington from 2014-2015 found 8% of the samples were positive for both red blotch and leafroll. A small survey in southern Oregon found some symptomatic vines (in red blotch positive vineyards) tested negative while some healthy appearing vines tested positive.
Research has indicated yield reduction of 22% and 37% in affected 'Merlot' and 'Cabernet franc' grapevines, respectively, compared with corresponding non-symptomatic grapevines. Berries from affected grapevines of both cultivars had reduced Brix (as much as 5 points in some scion/rootstock combinations) and skin anthocyanins, but higher titratable acidity compared to berries from non-symptomatic vines. In contrast, no significant difference was observed in pH of juice extracted from berries of symptomatic and non-symptomatic grapevines of both cultivars.
The three-cornered alfalfa hopper is a green, clear-winged, wedge-shaped (thus the name ""three-cornered"") insect that is about a 0.25 inch long (about the size of a tiny pea). The green color is similar to the grape leaf, so they are difficult to detect. It feeds on many other plants, including alfalfa, beans, cowpeas, melon, oats, sweet clover, tomato, and wheat. It does not feed much on grapevine but when it does, it can girdle the petiole causing the leaf to turn red. It is not known if management of this vector in the field will effectively manage the disease. Current research may also find other arthropod vectors.


","In red winegrape cultivars, symptoms initially appear as small, irregular red-colored areas between major veins on mature leaves at the basal portion of the shoots of affected vines, and symptoms develop on leaves further up the canes as the season progresses. The discolored areas on the leaves expand and coalesce with time to become reddish or reddish-purple blotches that are strikingly apparent towards the end of the season. In some cultivars the veins become red in contrast to the green veins usually observed with grapevine leafroll disease. Additionally, the leaf blades do not curl downward as is often seen in plants infected with the Grapevine leafroll-associated viruses. In general, the two diseases are easily confused. Multiple infections of different virus are likely and contribute to this confusion. At this time there seems to be considerable variation in degree of reddening depending on cultivar and rootstock. Also, nutrient deficiencies, water stress, and other stresses can be mistaken for grapevine red blotch disease.
White winegrape cultivars that tested positive for the virus do not exhibit reddening of leaves, though 'Chardonnay' develops interveinal chlorosis that can progress to necrosis before leaf drop. In the case of 'Pinot gris', the Brix levels were not reduced, though yields were reduced dramatically. In 'Chardonnay' (and 'Riesling') Brix levels were affected significantly similar to that observed in 'Cabernet Franc'.


","Only general control tactics for plant viruses are advised at this time since so little is known about this disease.

1) Plant healthy stock. Clones of most rootstocks and cultivars that have been tested and found to be free of all known viruses are available.

2) Ask nurseries for virus testing results, if using grafted plants ask for results from the grafted plants, or from the rootstocks and scions used to make those plants.

3) Consider having an audit test on the plants once they arrive at your location.

4) Try not to plant a new block adjacent to an infected block or vineyard.

5) Have both scion and rootstock tested when top-working to a new cultivar.

6) Tag or flag positive vines for future management tactics such as vine removal.

7) For other viral diseases of other crops, treatment of infected plants with an approved insecticide prior to removal is used to limit spread of insect vectors. It is not known if this practice will help manage red blotch in grapes.

8) Removing adjacent non-symptomatic vines is helpful for some diseases but it is not known if this practice will help manage red blotch in grapes.

9) Remove escaped seedlings and grape vines adjacent to the vineyard.

10) Maintain vineyard health and vigor through good nutrition, proper irrigation, and reduced crop load to reduce physical and environmental stresses.

Grape ,(Vitis spp.)-Inflorescence Necrosis (Bunch Stem Necrosis),"A physiological problem that has not been explained fully. Frequent attempts to isolate pathogens from necrotic tissue have not resulted in any fungi or bacteria. The disorder is associated with cool and/or wet weather just before bloom. Excessive vigor, shade just before bloom, and general stresses have also been associated with symptoms. The disorder resulted in low yields 4 out of 10 years in the 1980s in Oregon. Although many cultivars have shown symptoms of the disorder, it is more readily observed on Pinot Noir than on Chardonnay.
The problem is thought to be different from other factors that affect fruit set such as cool, wet weather that leads to poor ovule fertilization. Poor fruit set also can be from boron or zinc deficiencies and from excessive nitrogen that leads to excess vigor. In some cases, certain rootstock - cultivar combinations can induce inflorescence necrosis due to differences in nutrient uptake and utilization.


","The problem is characterized by necrotic flower and pedicel tissue. In severe cases, the necrosis can extend into the rachis or peduncle tissue. Necrotic florets may retain their calypteras. The disorder is observed just before bloom through fruit set.


","Avoid excessive vegetative growth through rootstock management and judicious use of nitrogen fertilizer.

",,
Grape ,(Vitis spp.)-Iron Chlorosis,"High pH soils have little available iron and can result in iron chlorosis. This is often called ""lime chlorosis"" as lime additions that increase soil pH impact iron availability. When high soil pH causes iron deficiency, other nutrients may also be deficient. Vitis labrusca and related cultivars tend to be more susceptible than Vitis vinifera.


","Leaves yellow, starting at the margin and progressing inward until, in severe cases, only the areas around larger veins remain green. Deficiency is usually observed in young leaves, which are smaller. Deficiency is difficult to diagnose based on tissue tests because leaf iron concentrations are often within a normal range. Based on experience in the Pacific Northwest, correcting iron deficiency in vineyards has been difficult and depends largely on the soil of a given site.


","

1) Adjust soil pH to around 7.0. Adding sulfur or organic matter, especially conifer needle mulch, which is highly acidic, may help. Note that grapevine rootstocks can endure a range of soil pH between 5.5 to 7.0.

2) Using iron chelate (Fe EDDHA), as a soil treatment or foliar feed, may help chlorotic plants. Read and follow all label instructions.

",,
Grape ,(Vitis spp.)-Leafroll,"There are nine viruses that have been reported to cause leafroll disease in grapevines and are collectively called Grapevine leafroll-associated viruses or GLRaV. Some of the viruses associated with grapevine leafroll disease have been found in Idaho (GLRaV-1, -2, -3), Oregon (GLRaV-1, -2, -3, -4, -7), Washington (GLRaV-1, -2, -3, -4, -5, -9) and British Columbia (GLRaV-1, -2, -3, -4) vineyards. Of the viruses associated with leafroll disease, GLRaV-3 was the virus most often found in surveys in the Pacific Northwest and with transmission by the grape mealybug. The soft scale has also been shown to be a vector of this virus. Symptoms may take 1 to 3 years to develop after infection. Propagating vines from infected stock plants is another way these viruses are moved from one vineyard to the next. GLRaV-1 has even been found in ornamental grapes for sale at retail nurseries. The grape mealybug is common in southern Oregon, eastern Oregon, and Columbia River production areas. It is critical that growers use only certified wood when establishing vineyards. All grapes entering Oregon and Washington are under quarantine and must be certified free of leafroll viruses.
Winegrapes (Vitis vinifera) show symptoms while other grape species are symptomless hosts. The rootstocks AXR and St. George are tolerant of the virus but susceptible to phylloxera. The newer phylloxera-resistant rootstocks; however, are more susceptible to virus problems. Diseased vines tend to be aggregated in the vineyard and disease incidence can increase up to 11% each year. Yield losses of up to 50% to 70% have been observed in vineyards with this disease. Brix reductions also add to the loss over the lifetime of the vineyard. Taken together in one study for an infected Merlot block, losses due to lower yield and Brix reductions translated into thousands of dollars per acre.


","Leafroll, also called red leaf or white emperor disease, reddens the lower foliage of dark-fruit cultivars in September and October. Reddened leaves may also exhibit green veins. Foliage of white-fruit cultivars may have subtle yellowing at this time. Leaf symptoms typically begin around verasion on lower older leaves and progress up to younger leaves through the rest of the growing season. Other symptoms include delayed foliation in spring, downward curling or rolling of leaves, and less vigorous vine growth in adverse circumstances.  Symptoms may take 1 to 3 years to develop after infection. Potassium deficiency mimics many of the symptoms caused by GLRaV. The vein clearing associated with leafroll disease can be used to discriminate it from similar leaf discoloration caused by other stress factors.
Infected vines may produce fewer, smaller clusters of berries lower than normal in soluble solids. The grapes on red-fruit cultivars do not color well and may not all ripen at the same time.
Leafroll will cause less severe symptoms in ungrafted plants. Some of the leafroll viruses can also cause graft union necrosis in grafted plants, usually when present in mixed infections. Symptom severity depends on the virus, rootstock and scion combination. Thus, there is a wide range of symptoms that can be caused by these viruses. Visual diagnosis is unreliable and vines should be lab tested for confirmation. Can be confused with Grapevine Red Blotch Disease.


","

1) Plant healthy stock. Only nonrooted cuttings certified free of fanleaf and leafroll can be shipped into Oregon and Washington. Clones of most rootstocks and cultivars that have been tested and found to be free of all known viruses are available.

2) Control of mealybugs and scales is important in vineyards where the presence of leafroll virus has been confirmed. See the  for details.

3) Remove and destroy virus-infected vines only after treatment for mealybugs. Roguing is more effective in younger vineyards. Due to lag of symptom development the removal of adjacent vines is advised if using a visual diagnostic method.

Grape ,"(Vitis spp.)-Nematode, Dagger","Xiphinema americanum, has been found in 85% of the vineyards surveyed in western Oregon, while X. pachtaicum, and/or X. americanum were found in 74% of eastern Washington vineyards. Only X. americanum is known to be a vector of Tobacco ringspot virus, which has been reported occasionally on grape in the Pacific Northwest. Dagger nematodes are migratory ectoparasites found only in soil. As virus vectors they can be damaging at very low population levels. Dagger nematode populations may be very low in late summer when other nematodes are abundant.


","Enlarged root tips and feeder roots may occur, which could result in a witches' broom effect on roots. Yields may be reduced when nematode populations reach high levels.

Grape ,"(Vitis spp.)-Nematode, Ring","Mesocriconema xenoplax, an ectoparasite which gets its common name from the cuticular ring ornamentation around its body. The nematode moves slowly as it browses along the root and may feed at one site up to 7 days. It feeds from outside of the root by inserting a stylet into an individual root cortical cell. Ring nematode does not disrupt the cell membrane during feeding, but alters the sink strength of the punctured cell and those cells surrounding it, allowing for greater metabolic activity. Ring nematodes were found in 85% of Oregon vineyards surveyed but in only 5% of Washington vineyards. Due to low population densities in typical vineyard soils there is little concern that ring nematode will cause significant damage in Oregon vineyards.


","At high population densities, this nematode can cause extensive root pruning, which stresses the plant and reduces yields. Own-rooted vines are more tolerant of these nematodes.

Grape ,(Vitis spp.)-Pierce's Disease,"Pierce's Disease, (Xylella fastidiosa subsp. fastidiosa),which has been a high-profile and rapidly increasing disease in California, and other Southern States, is not known to be in the Pacific Northwest. Our climate may be too cold for the pathogen to survive. Infected grapevines do not retain the pathogen after a cold dormant-season typical of continental climates. The disease is in Florida and Texas and can be very damaging. Sucking xylem-feeding insects, such as leafhoppers and spittlebugs, vector the bacterium. The majority of leafhoppers found in surveys are Western grape leafhopper, which is not an efficient vector of Xylella. The Blue-green sharpshooter vectors Xylella and has been found in the Willamette Valley, Columbia Gorge, Medford, and Milton-Freewater areas of Oregon. This leafhopper is usually found in surrounding vegetation and less in vineyards.
Another vector (the glassy-winged sharpshooter) was found in California during the mid-1990s. Unlike the blue-green sharpshooter this insect is not restricted to riparian areas. The presence of the glassy winged sharpshooter is having a huge impact on producers in southern California. Several glassy-winged sharpshooters were found near western Oregon ornamental nurseries in 2000. An extensive survey that fall of 291 samples from vineyards, native hosts, and nurseries did not find any evidence of the causal bacterium, Xylella fastidiosa subsp. fastidiosa. Periodic tests of grape and various woody plants with scorch symptoms have been conducted since then, and no Xylella has been detected.
Hosts in which the bacteria go systemic are important harbors for this disease and include Vinca minor and Himalayan blackberry as well as Vitis spp. The same subspecies of bacteria can cause almond leaf scorch but another subspecies (X. f. subsp. multiplex) that can also cause almond leaf scorch does not infect grape.


","Symptoms appear when a significant amount of xylem becomes blocked by the bacteria's growth. Any other problem that blocks, inhibits or limits water from getting to the leaves will produce similar symptoms. Dryland grapes grown in western Oregon during the drought of 2001 displayed some of these same symptoms. Fungal cankers, damaged trunks, girdling roots, gopher damage, herbicide injury and root rots also can produce similar symptoms.
Symptoms of Pierce's Disease first appear as water stress in midsummer. Leaves become slightly yellow or red along margins in white and red varieties, respectively, and eventually leaf margins dry or die in concentric zones. Fruit clusters shrivel or raisin. Dried leaves fall, leaving the petiole attached to the cane. Wood on new canes matures irregularly, producing patches of green, surrounded by mature brown bark. 'Pinot Noir' and 'Cabernet Sauvignon' have highly regular zones of progressive marginal discoloration and drying on leaf blades.
Usually only one or two canes will show Pierce's Disease symptoms late in the first season of infection. Symptoms gradually spread along the cane from the point of infection out toward the end and more slowly toward the base. Cane tips and roots may die back. Vines deteriorate rapidly after symptoms appear. Shoot growth in infected plants becomes progressively weaker as symptoms become more pronounced.

Grape ,(Vitis spp.)-Powdery Mildew,"Erysiphe necator (formerly Uncinula necator), a fungal disease common to all areas of the Pacific Northwest. The disease tends to be more severe on the west side of the Cascade Range but is a chronic problem in arid districts where over-the-canopy irrigation is used for early-season frost protection or watering. There is low tolerance to this disease on the fruit as it can impart negative tastes later in the wine. An infection of 3% to 5% of the berries results in an oily, viscous mouth feel in the wine. Vitis vinifera (European) cultivars are susceptible to powdery mildew while V. labrusca (American) cultivars are more resistant. Hybrids between the two species have various levels of resistance. Other hosts include Boston ivy, Virginia creeper, and Ampelopsis (porcelain berry). The fungus may overwinter as a group of thin threads called hyphae, inside the vine's dormant buds and/or as small black bodies (chasmothecia) on the exfoliating bark of the vine.
Buds on new shoots can be infected 4 to 6 weeks after shoots start growing but not after bud scales become suberized. These new infected buds remain quiescent until the next growing season. The fungus infects developing buds during the growing season. Shortly after budbreak, the fungus becomes active and covers the emergent shoot with a large white mass of threads or mycelium (""flag shoots""). Flag shoots have rarely been observed in commercial western Oregon or eastern Washington vineyards.
Chasmothecia on the exfoliating bark release sexual spores during rainy weather above 50°F from budbreak through bloom. This weather also favors infection that results in individual powdery spots, called colonies, on the surface of leaves growing close to the bark.
Many asexual spores (conidia) are produced on the surface of powdery mildew colonies. Under optimal conditions of mild temperatures and high humidity, a single spore can germinate, infect the plant, and produce a new colony and a new crop of spores in 3 days. Temperatures over 85°F and/or sunlight (ultraviolet) inhibit conidia germination. Nights where temperatures fall below 40°F can damage colonies, increase the time new ones form, and reduce their size. Free water from rain and/or irrigation can wash conidia off a colony, burst conidia, or result in poor or abnormal germination of conidia.
Grape berries are highly susceptible from the time calyptras (hoods) fall off to shortly after bloom when berries are about pea size (BBCH 73 to 75). Susceptibility of the fruit drops rapidly after that time. Grapes do not get new infections on fruit after 8% Brix but can still have sporulation up to 15% Brix. Leaves and canes, however, can be infected up to and past harvest.


","Powdery mildew can attack all aboveground plant parts. In early stages, whitish or grayish patches are on leaves and, if severe, ultimately cover both surfaces. Colonies are more easily detected in full sunlight with the sun over your shoulder. Later in the season, the colony darkens and is peppered with minute black dots (chasmothecia). On fruit, the fungus at first may look grayish or whitish but later has a brownish, russeted appearance. Infected fruit cracks and drops from the cluster. Even blossoms sometimes can be infected, causing them to dry up or fail to set fruit. When green shoots and canes are infected, the affected tissues appear dark brown to black in feathery patches. Patches later appear reddish brown on the surface of dormant canes.
Flag shoots are difficult to detect. Some young shoots may be covered with a large white mass of threads or mycelium. Others may have only a hint of thin threads on the shoot. Shoots generally are delayed in bud break and appear stunted and somewhat yellowed compared to healthy shoots. Can be confused with normal trichome density of young shoots of some cultivars.


","Activities and tactics that increase sunlight exposure to leaves and fruit reduce powdery mildew severity.

1) Prevent excess vigor through proper selection of rootstocks, training systems, irrigation, and fertility for the vineyard site.

2) Practice timely sucker control.

3) Keep canes cut back close to the top wire of vertical trellises for better spray coverage.

4) Removing leaves to manage bunch rot also helps fungicide cover the clusters, which helps control powdery mildew.

5) Manage sources of powdery mildew outside of the vineyard such as susceptible plants found in decorative gardens near tasting rooms or gazebos.

","Begin applications at 6 inches shoot growth and continue at regular intervals through the growing season. Strongest materials and shortest intervals should be used from prebloom (BBCH 57) through bloom and continued for 2 weeks after bloom. A postharvest application may help control late-season infections in some years. Thorough coverage of all actively growing tissue is essential for good control. Do not extend application intervals in the Willamette Valley past 2 weeks.
Research in California has shown that sulfur sprays at budbreak initiate a release of ascospores and have some utility in overall disease management. Although this may occur in the more arid areas of the Pacific Northwest, it may not have the same utility in wetter areas west of the Cascade Range.
Resistance to many different fungicide groups has been documented for grape powdery mildew worldwide. Resistance to Group 3 and 11 fungicides has been documented in Oregon and Washington. To prevent developing resistant fungi, alternate or tank-mix materials from different groups with different modes of action. Also, limit applications from any specific group to two (2) or fewer sprays.  New York recommends to tank-mix Group 3 or Group 11 fungicides with sulfur or other products with a different mode of action. Several forecasting programs are available to help time applications (see below).

Grape ,(Vitis spp.)-Short Shoot Syndrome,"Short shoot syndrome (SSS), a term coined by the Oregon wine grape industry, describes a vine condition where shoots are severely stunted early in spring. Research conducted in Oregon and other cool climate grape growing regions worldwide have shown a relationship of this specific type of stunting with presence of grape rust mites (Calepitrimerus vitis).  Other factors can cause stunting of shoots. Additional research needs to be conducted to further understand the explicit role of mites on grapevines and potential links with shoot stunting. The symptoms of SSS are observed sporadically across years and locations in the Willamette Valley of Oregon and are rarely observed in warmer regions of the state. Young vineyards seem to have the greatest occurrence of SSS related to high rust mite populations. In some cases, crop losses have been observed. Those vineyards managed with sulfur spray programs often do not have high rust mite populations or incidence of SSS.
Stunting can be caused by other factors, including micronutrient deficiencies (boron and zinc), phylloxera infestation, crown gall, lack of irrigation or fertilization over time, many of which can lead to poor vine growth and low nutrient/carbohydrate reserves. When these factors are the cause of stunting, the pattern of short shoots is uniform across a vine and possibly a whole section of a vineyard while SSS is usually more sporadic and related to a pest population of rust mites.
Taking samples of tissue early season and examining them for rust mite presence is important to determine cause of the stunting. Thrips may also cause similar damage such as scarring and stunting of young vine tissues. Research in Oregon has found significant rust mite and thrips populations in vineyards early in spring, and it is difficult to determine which pest is causing specific symptoms such as scarring and stunting.


","The first symptoms of SSS are observed as slow growing buds and stunted shoot growth very early in spring, before the shoots reach 6 inches in length. The basal leaves on stunted shoots appear puckered with a ""drawstring"" effect where the leaf margin fails to expand. These leaves do not develop much further and may fall off. Stunted shoots often have scarring on the stems, and the inflorescence may be damaged. The stems may have a zigzag shape due to the stunting of shoot growth.
Vines with rust mite-associated SSS generally have stunting occurring sporadically across a vine, with some shoots developing normally while others are stunted. In cane-pruned vines, the affected shoots arise from the region of the cane nearest the head of the vine while more distal shoots appear to develop normally. This should not be confused with natural apical dominance, which can cause shoots at the distal portions to grow faster than those at the head of the vine. Stunted shoots observed with mite-associated SSS often outgrow the condition and resume normal shoot growth once daily temperatures increase in spring, if the shoot tip is not damaged.
Damage to the lower portions of the shoot will remain and can be observed later in the season. If rust mite populations increase in the vine canopy, they can cause stippling of leaves (early to mid-summer) and may lead to leaf blackening in mid-late summer, which then leads to bronzing in early-mid fall. Stippling and bronzing have been associated with very high mite populations per leaf.


",,,
Grape ,(Vitis spp.)-Sour Rot,"Sour rot is caused by a succession of events starting with berry wounding, then ethanol production by Saccharomyces yeasts, then acetic acid production from ethanol by bacteria, followed by fruit fly activity. The ""sour"" or vinegar smell is typically associated with the invasion of the bacteria Acetobacter and Gluconobacter. The vinegar smell is due to both gluconic acid as well as acetic acid. The yeasts or bacteria alone cannot by themselves cause sour rot. The specific activity of fruit flies is not known. If fruit is initially damaged as a result of excessive rain (as in the fall of 2013), excessive wind and/or other diseases or insect pests, many secondary invasions by fungal and bacterial microorganisms can occur. Sour rot is of concern when rain occurs after berries are at or above 15 Brix and temperatures are in the 60's. Sour rot typically does not spread from cluster to cluster, but can result in whole cluster loss.
Sour rots can be a significant problem regardless of harvest weather conditions. They are associated with varieties with compact clusters and varieties that are aromatic (and thus, attract insects). Conditions that favor development of grapevine powdery mildew or Botrytis bunch rot can also favor sour rot development.


","Sour rot is best described as a ""wet rot"" in ripening grape clusters. Typical symptoms include a brown discoloration of the fruit and wet or oozing berries, coupled with the smell of vinegar and the presence of fruit flies. Sour rot is often confused with (and in many cases associated with) the early stages of Botrytis bunch rot, but can be distinguished by the associated ""sour"" smell. As a general distinction, Botrytis bunch rot is a dry (fuzzy) rot of ripening fruit, whereas sour rot is considered a wet rot.


","Once sour rot begins in a vineyard, it cannot be controlled. Therefore, the primary tactic in managing sour rot is prevention of fruit damage as a result of other diseases, insect pests, and birds.

1) Dropping affected clusters preharvest may help prevent inadvertent picking of diseased fruit.

2) If sour rot symptoms are severe, pick as early as possible to reduce the amount of spoiled fruit.

","While there are no real effective chemical measures specifically designed for the management of sour rot, in-season programs that provide effective control of powdery mildew and Botrytis bunch rot may reduce the risk of developing sour rot in a vineyard. Methods that target both microbes and fruit flies are necessary after berries are 15°Brix. See the PNW Insect Management Handbook for details on fruit fly management. The following specifically mention sour rot.

Grape ,(Vitis spp.)-Virus Diseases,"The viruses associated with grapevine leafroll disease and corky bark disease have been found in Oregon and Washington vineyards. Leafroll disease spreads through insect vectors, while corky bark either does not move in vineyards or moves very slowly. Of the viruses associated with leafroll disease, GLRaV-3 was the virus most often found in surveys. The grape mealybug, as shown in Washington and California, transmits this virus. This mealybug is common in southern Oregon, eastern Oregon, and the Columbia River production areas. Therefore, it is critical that growers use only certified wood when establishing vineyards. All grapes entering Oregon and Washington are under quarantine and must be certified free of leafroll viruses. As more vines are grafted onto rootstocks to guard against Phylloxera, these viruses will become more damaging if they get established. Leafroll will cause symptoms in ungrafted plants but may cause graft union necrosis in grafted plants as will corky bark. Vitis vinifera cultivars that carry corky bark do not show symptoms until they are grafted onto American rootstocks.
Rupestris stem pitting-associated virus (RSPaV) is in Oregon and Washington and is not listed as a quarantinable virus. It remains an important component of the Washington certification program, although California, Canada, France, and Germany do not have this virus listed as restricted in their certification schemes. It is generally accepted that RSPaV is a minor virus, though its effect in mixed or multiple infections is unclear.
Seven nematode-transmitted viruses (Nepoviruses) are known to infect grapevines in North America including: Arabis mosaic virus, Blueberry leaf mottle virus, Grapevine fanleaf virus, Peach rosette mosaic virus, Tobacco ringspot virus, Tomato black ring virus, and Tomato ringspot virus. In a survey of vineyards in Oregon known to have Xiphinema americanum nematodes, only Tomato ringspot virus was detected and then only in a few vineyards in the Willamette Valley. However, Tobacco ringspot virus and Grapevine fanleaf virus have been detected in several vineyards the Yakima Valley in Washington in plants exhibiting symptoms of fanleaf degeneration/decline. It is not expected that fanleaf would be a problem in the PNW, since the vector, X. index, has not been found in surveys in Oregon and Washington. Similarly, the nematode vector of Arabis mosaic virus is not widely distributed in North America. All grapevines entering Oregon and Washington must be certified free of these Nepoviruses.
A new disease caused by Grapevine red blotch virus (GRBV) was first reported in 2012. The discovery occurred when grapevines with red leaf symptoms that tested negative for Grapevine leafroll-associated viruses (1-10) (GLRaV) were analyzed for possible new viruses. GRBV is the type member of the new Grablovirus genus, in the family Geminiviridae that is graft-transmissible. All grapevines entering Oregon and Washington must be certified free of the GRBV.


","Leafroll, also called red leaf or white emperor disease, reddens the lower foliage of dark-fruit cultivars in September and October. Foliage of white-fruit cultivars may yellow at this time. Other symptoms include delayed foliation in spring, downcurling of leaves, production of fewer, smaller clusters of berries lower than normal in soluble solids, and less vigorous vine growth in adverse circumstances. The grapes of red-fruit cultivars do not color well when infected with GLRaV. Potassium deficiency symptoms mimic many of the symptoms caused by GLRaV. The vein clearing associated with leafroll disease can be used to discriminate it from similar leaf discoloration caused by other stress factors.
Red Blotch - In red winegrape cultivars, these symptoms initially appear as small, irregular red-colored areas between major veins on mature leaves at the basal portion of the canopy of affected vines, and symptoms develop on leaves further up the canes as the season progresses. The discolored areas on the leaves expand and coalesce with time to become reddish or reddish-purple blotches that are strikingly apparent towards the end of the season. In some cultivars the veins become red in contrast to the green veins usually observed with grapevine leafroll disease. However, the symptoms of this disease can be confused with grapevine leafroll disease. At this time there seems to be considerable variation in degree of reddening depending on cultivar and rootstock. Reports of the impact of GRBV on changes in fruit quality vary widely with Brix reductions of 0 to 5 reported as well as changes in the pH and phenolics profile of the juice. White cultivars positive for the virus did not exhibit the symptom of reddening of leaves, and in the case of Chardonnay, leaves developed yellowing and some necrosis late in the season; juice was affected similarly to red grapes.
All of the Nepoviruses are associated with poor fruit set in grapevines. Loose clusters and abundant small shot berries characterize virus infection. Tomato ringspot virus can cause a graft union necrosis in grafted vines, and can result in declining plants leading to plant death in 3-5 years.
Fanleaf symptoms are best seen early in the growing season. New growth on infected vines often is dwarfed on weak, flattened, crooked canes. Young leaves are mottled and deformed, showing excessive dentation (abnormally sawtoothed leaf edge) and a broad sinus at the petiole. Together, these symptoms resemble a partially closed fan, much like 2,4-D injury. Some strains cause bright yellow patterns on leaves, often without the leaf deformation associated with other Grapevine fanleaf virus strains. Grapevine yellow vein virus is another strain, it produces distinct yellowish or whitish bands along leaf veins most of the season. The distribution of the yellow vein strain appears to be very limited at this time.
Corky bark causes an incompatibility to develop at the graft union. Leaf symptoms resemble those of leafroll but are more severe on some rootstocks. Leaves on cultivars such as Pinot Noir may develop a yellow chlorosis before they turn red. The wood at the base of canes may swell slightly, causing the bark to split. Depending on the cultivar, various wood grooving also may occur. On self-rooted grapevines, the symptoms of corky bark are very mild.
Rupestris stem pitting-associated virus is suspected of causing a slow decline of Vitis vinifera. Affected vines are smaller than healthy ones, but leaves appear normal. Delayed ripening and reduced yields have been associated with this problem. Rootstocks of V. rupestris and its hybrids develop pitting in the xylem, observed on woody tissues after bark is removed. Easily confused with corky bark symptoms. On self-rooted grapevines, RSPaV intensifies the symptoms associated with leafroll disease.


","

1) Plant healthy stock. Only nonrooted cuttings certified free of fanleaf and leafroll can be shipped into Oregon and Washington. Clones of most rootstocks and cultivars that have been tested and found to be free of all known viruses are available.

2) ,  and  are transmitted in soil by certain nematodes of the genus  but the vector of fanleaf () has not been found in the PNW. Old grapevine roots infected with fanleaf persist many years in soil and serve as reservoirs of these viruses. Therefore, do not replant grapes in infested ground for 10 years unless you use special fallowing procedures and then fumigate deeply.

3) Control of mealybugs and scales is important in vineyards with confirmed leafroll. See the  for details.

4) Remove and destroy virus-infected vines.

Grape ,(Vitis spp.)-Young Vine Decline,,,,,
Grass for Seed,Barley Yellow Dwarf,"Barley yellow dwarf virus (BYDV) infects many cultivated and wild grasses, including tall fescue, Chewing's fescue, ryegrass, orchardgrass, and bluegrass. Many grassy species in non-managed grasslands present in the Pacific Northwest are susceptible to BYDV, including: Achnatherum lettermanii, A. occidentale, A. thurberianum, Alopecurus pratensis, Bromus inermis, Danthonia intermedia, Elymus elymoides, Poa bulbosa, P. fendleriana, P. secunda, Sporobolus airoides, and S. cryptandrus. A group of virus strains can incite yellow dwarf and cause worldwide disease problems on barley, oats, and wheat. Some hosts may not show visible symptoms of infection, as is common for corn in the Pacific Northwest. BYDV is transmitted by several species of aphid, including the bird cherry-oat aphid (Rhopalosiphum padi), rose-grass aphid (Metopolophium dirhodum), English grain aphid (Sitobion avenae), corn leaf aphid (Rhopalosiphum maidis), and green bug aphid (Schizaphis graminum). Virus strains transmitted primarily by Rhopalosiphum padi are now called Cereal yellow dwarf virus (CYDV)-RPV, while those transmitted by Sitobion avenae are called BYDV-MAV. Virus strains transmitted by both aphid species are called BYDV-PAV. Metopolophium dirhodum is reported to transmit BYDV-PAV strains and possibly CYDV-RPV, while Rhopalosiphum maidis is reported to transmit BYDV-MAV and an additional strain, BYDV-RMV. Several strains of virus associated with yellow dwarf symptoms have been detected in perennial ryegrass (PRG) fields in the Willamette Valley: BYDV-PAV, BYDV-MAV, and CYDV-RPV. Studies during low aphid population years (2011-2012) in the Willamette Valley showed most PRG plants from first year fields tested positive for BYDV at low levels with only a single virus strain being found in individual plants. As aphid populations rebounded to normal-high levels the following season, the majority of plants tested positive for at least one strain of BYDV and multiple virus strains were found in approximately 50% of PRG plants tested from a plot in a commercial planting. Studies in cereals have shown that when BYDV-PAV and CYDV-RPV occur to together in a cereal plant, more severe symptoms develop, than when plants are infected with either virus strain alone.
Disease is more severe in cool, moist weather as these conditions favor aphid populations, which is usually spring or fall in the Willamette Valley. In the cereals, symptoms develop 2 to 4 weeks after infection when temperature is 68°F to 77°F and there is ample light. No symptoms develop in barley when temperature is greater than 86°F and this probably occurs in many grass species. Symptoms are not expected to develop on grass seed crops during the winter months because low temperature and light conditions inhibit symptom development. Plants become systemically infected, therefore, once perennial grass plants are infected, symptoms can reappear during subsequent growing seasons.
Damage is not always severe, it is influenced by the growth stage at infection; more severe symptoms occur when plants are infected as seedlings. Virulence of the viral strain and dosage (aphid levels), amount of primary and secondary spread, and susceptibility of the cultivar/grass species all affect the level of damage that occurs on a grass seed crop. Research in the UK shows that sometimes ryegrass is asymptomatic but that a reduction in perennial ryegrass height and sward growth can still be detected when plants show little foliar symptomology. While some ryegrass cultivars may exhibit a decrease in leaf production, others may have a marked increase in foliage. Infection of ryegrass by BYDV can increase the proportion of vegetative to fertile tillers, and the pattern of seasonal productivity may change. Root development of ryegrass is negatively affected by BYDV and even cultivars that gave increased shoot growth exhibited reduced root growth. Research in cereals has shown that hosts may be more susceptible to root rots, including Take-all, once infected by BYDV. Whether variation exists among cultivars grown in western Oregon grass seed fields is unknown and little is known about the impact of barley yellow dwarf on grass seed crops.


","Symptoms can be variable and may be confused with nutrient deficiencies or stress; the presence of BYDV-PAV, BYDV-MAV, and CYDV-RPV can be confirmed with serological testing done by plant clinics. A common symptom is yellowish or reddish leaf tips. Often the leaf tissue next to the midribs stays greener than the rest of the leaf. The youngest leaves may have normal color. Affected leaves can have yellow blotches, which may become reddish to purplish. Discolored leaves may prematurely die-back during hot, dry weather. Discolored leaves may be more sensitive to cold injury; affected leaf tips of serologically-positive plants were observed to turn necrotic after below-freezing temperatures during the spring of 2013. Phloem tissue may be darkened. Root systems are often underdeveloped and plants may be more susceptible to soilborne pathogens or drought-stress. Plants affected as seedlings may be stunted and not head. In some grass species, seed yield is decreased in the absence of severe stunting. During many seasons, perennial ryegrass fields in the Willamette Valley have been found to contain infected grass plants; circular groups of affected plants can often be seen during early spring (Feb-April). Plants appear stunted and yellowish in color and will often develop purplish-red leaf tips before harvest and on the fall-regrowth. Stand die-out may occur during adverse conditions, particularly after the second year of PRG seed harvest, with dead or unthrifty plants becoming apparent during regrowth after the summer dry period and subsequent winter weather.


","

1) Sow new plantings in late fall or early spring so seedling stage is before or after peak aphid flight.

2) In affected plantings, reduce stress on plants by providing balanced fertility. Consult OSU Extension EM 9086: Nutrient Management Guide for Perennial Ryegrass Grown for Seed (Western Oregon).

","BYDV cannot be controlled directly in grass plants but growers can control indirectly by slowing or stopping spread. Apply granular systemic insecticides in-furrow at planting to reduce aphid numbers. Foliar sprays prior to peak flight in the spring and fall can also reduce aphid numbers. Research by OSU has shown yield improvements during the second seed harvest in limited studies; however, yields may not be boosted under lower aphid populations. (For materials, rates, and procedures, consult the PNW Insect Management Handbook.)

Grass for Seed,Black Holes,"A fungus, Sordaria sp., that is commonly found in the feces of herbivores. It is not considered a pathogen of grass or other plants. It showed up in Oregon seed fields during 2011 in areas of fields treated with high rates of chicken litter under unusually warm and wet early fall conditions. The fungus produces masses of black ascospores, which can coat leaf blades.


","Black powdery masses are found on soil surface, stubble, and grass leaf blades and form roundish black patches. A few, up to many, patches can be found. The spores can be wiped off the leaf blades and healthy green leaf blades are apparent underneath.


","

1) Wait for spores to be washed or blown off leaf blades.

2) Avoid high rates of chicken manure amendments.

",,
Grass for Seed,Blind Seed,"A fungus, Gloeotinia temulenta, that lives in infected grass seed. Over 40 species of grass are susceptible. The disease is most common in annual ryegrass, perennial ryegrass, and tall fescue. In spring, the fungus emerges as stalked, cup-shaped apothecia (one to several per seed). Ascospores are ejected from the apothecia into the air; only those that land on flowers of a susceptible grass host will infect. Within two weeks of infection, secondary spores (conidia) may form on the surface of developing seed. Conidia are spread to healthy flowers by rain splashing. Rainy conditions are required for blind seed development and spread. The disease often develops in early maturing cultivars, especially when prolonged rainy weather occurs during flowering.


","Poor seed germination. Infected seed may be shrunken, rusty in color, or may have a pink coloration. Infected seed are difficult to find. Tests for blind seed include soaking the seeds in water to dislodge conidia, concentration by centrifugation, and examination under the microscope for conidia typical of Gloeotinia sp.


","

Grass for Seed

1) Plant pathogen-free seed. Infected seed stored dry for 24 months is considered safe to plant.

2) Plant later-maturing varieties.

3) Apply optimum rates of nitrogen fertilizer, and maintain a healthy and vigorous stand.

4) Remove as much seed as possible from the field during combining, especially lightweight seed.

5) Harvest at the proper time to reduce seed shatter.

6) Open field burning has proven effective in blind seed control.

7) Plow the field after harvest or bury seed deeper than 2 inches. At this depth the fruiting bodies cannot reach the soil surface.

Grass for Seed,Brown Leaf Rust,,,,,
Grass for Seed,Brown Stripe and Gray Streak,"Cercosporidium graminis (teleomorph: Mycosphaerella recutita), a fungus that overwinters as mycelial stromata in affected leaves and debris and infects all cool season turf and forage grasses including: orchardgrass, fescue, ryegrass, bluegrass, and bentgrass. Conidia develop from overwintering mycelium and are splashed, blown, or otherwise disseminated to healthy leaves. The brown stripe fungus sporulates during cool, moist weather in spring and autumn. Warm, dry summers restrict the ability of the fungus to cause disease.


","Leaf spots appear as brown to gray elongated lesions on leaves by mid-spring or in the fall. Small gray to black groups of conidiophores visibly erupt through leaf stomata. This is one of the common leaf spot fungi observed on orchardgrass, usually appearing later than scald or purple eyespot. It does not appear to attack the head or to cause severe leaf loss late in the season as the scald fungus does, but it can contribute to loss of leaf tissue.


",,"In most years, control is not necessary in grass for seed.

Grass for Seed,Cereal Yellow Dwarf,,,,,
Grass for Seed,Choke,"An endophytic fungus, Epichloe festucae (fine fescue) or Epichloe typhina (orchardgrass), that consists of a mass of white fungal tissue. Choke had been found primarily on Chewings fescue and red fescue but during 1996 was found also on orchardgrass in Oregon. On orchardgrass, the white mass is visible during May and then develops into an yellow fruiting body (stroma), up to several inches in length, producing numerous spore-bearing structures (perithecia) containing spores (ascospores). The fungal stroma is produced around the leaf sheath and may prevent elongation of seed heads, hence the name ""choke."" Ascospores are forcibly discharged, usually in early evening, and presumably serve to spread the disease, although that has been well documented only in orchardgrass. Stroma formation requires that the host's floral apex grow slowly at a critical stage of development (between ""double ridges"" and ""spikelet primordium"") and that the fungus grows rapidly. No choke develops if the host grows rapidly through this critical developmental stage. If a stroma does not form, infected fescue plants can produce numerous seed, a high proportion of which is infected by the fungus. In orchardgrass, seed transmission is very rare. The fungus may exist endophytically in many clones of a grass but fruit only in a few clones. In orchardgrass, the fungus spreads by means of ascospores, ejected from the fungal stroma, which can penetrate healthy plants through the cut ends of stubble at harvest. Ascospore release ceases soon after the stroma-bearing part of a choked plant has been cut off.


","In summer, the mycelium forms a white, felt-like band of tissue (stroma) that encloses all or most of the spike or inflorescence as it attempts to emerge from the leaf sheath. Stroma development may prevent the inflorescence from emerging and developing a seed head. On orchardgrass, the white stroma, typically produced during May, changes to bright yellow as the perithecia form.


","Roguing plants with stroma usually is unsuccessful because of successive tiller formation and seasonal variation in plant growth and development.

1) Plant seed free of the pathogen.

2) In orchardgrass, cutting diseased areas and fields  cutting healthy areas may reduce the spread of the disease.

3) Preliminary studies by the USDA show a reduction in choke increase in young fields that underwent a propane burn.

","Eradicating the fungus in seeds and greenhouse-grown seedlings with fungicides (propiconazole and others) has been reported. However, no successful field treatment for controlling choke with fungicides has been reported.

Grass for Seed,Damping-off,"Several soil-inhabiting or seed-contaminating fungi or fungus-like microorganisms such as Pythium spp., Fusarium spp., and Rhizoctonia spp. Any soil condition that prevents rapid germination and emergence increases the possibility of seed rot, damping-off, or seedling blight.


","Seeds may decay in soil, or seedlings may become blighted by underground attack. Stands are thin and uneven or missing in small to large areas.

Grass for Seed-Drechslera Leaf Blights ,(Helminthosporium Net Blotch),"Drechslera spp. and Bipolaris spp. are fungi that survive as conidia and dormant mycelia in infected plant tissue and debris. Cool season grasses such as tall fescue, perennial ryegrass, bluegrass, fine fescue, bentgrass, and orchardgrass are all affected. This is one of the more common leaf spot diseases of ryegrass and tall fescue. Conidia are spread by wind, rain, irrigation water, or equipment. Cool, wet spring weather favors the disease. Conidia are produced at temperatures from 37°F to 80°F (59°F to 64°F is optimal). Moisture films on leaf surfaces are necessary for infection. Leaf spots generally occur when conditions are cool and wet, but some species are active during warm, moist periods.


","Leaf spot symptoms vary by host grass. In general, lesions first appear small and water soaked. Later, lesions become uniformly dark, reddish brown to purplish black, and elongated.
Lesions on tall fescue and perennial ryegrass may lie parallel and perpendicular to the leaf axis, resulting in a net-like appearance; hence the name ""net blotch."" Lesions may coalesce to form dark brown, solid spots. Heavily infected plants progressively die back from the tips, which can result in leaves' turning all brown.
In fine fescue, lesions appear as small, reddish brown, irregularly shaped spots. Lesions girdle leaves, causing yellowing and dieback from the tip. Lesions also attack the stem, killing the head.
Besides leaf blights, Drechslera spp. also cause crown and root diseases. These do not seem to be widespread in grass seed fields.

Grass for Seed,Dwarf Bunt,,,,,
Grass for Seed,Endophyte,"Neotyphodium coenophialum and N. lolii are fungi that grow within tall fescue and perennial ryegrass, respectively. The name endophyte describes this life habit of the fungi. Natural transmission occurs only by planting endophyte-infected seed; no transmission from infected to uninfected plants has been observed in nature. Both plant and fungus benefit from the relationship. Benefits to the host include enhanced seed germination rate, increased seedling vigor, improved drought tolerance, greater persistence, toxicity to certain herbivores, increased resistance to insects, and reduced disease severity with some, but not all, pathogens. Benefits to the fungus include host nutrition, protection, and a method for dissemination. Obviously, the presence of the endophyte can be positive or negative depending on whether an improved cultivar is used for forage or turf.


","Fungi grow within the host without showing any sign or symptom of infection. Both fungi can produce alkaloids toxic to cattle, sheep, and other livestock; eating endophyte-infected seed, hay, or infected pasture grass can result in toxicosis. The amount of alkaloids produced varies with environmental conditions during plant growth.


","Have plants tested. Feeding or grazing endophyte plant residue must be done with extreme caution.

",,
Grass for Seed,Ergot,"A fungus, Claviceps purpurea, that affects about 400 species of grass as hosts, including all species grown for seed. The disease is most common in bluegrass, bentgrass, and Chewings fescue but may occur in perennial ryegrass or tall fescue. Sclerotia of the fungus overwinter on or near the soil surface and germinate in spring, giving rise to stalked, spherical structures that eject ascospores. The flower is the only part susceptible to infection. The degree of infection depends on the amount of inoculum present and on the susceptibility of the crop species. Temperature, light, and other environmental conditions that affect the duration and uniformity of flower opening also determine the severity of infection. Infected florets exude a sticky, viscous combination of plant sap and conidia, commonly referred to as honeydew. Its high sugar content attracts insects, especially flies, which efficiently spread the disease (secondary spread). The disease cycle begins again when mature ergot fall to the ground.
Flower structure is important in the host's susceptibility to ergot. Species in which glumes tend to remain closed during flowering generally escape infection. Grasses such as annual bluegrass are highly susceptible, and their presence as wild grasses in field borders and headlands are an important source of inoculum.


","Hard, gray to purple-black, elongated bodies (sclerotia) replace seed. Sclerotia range from similar in size to a normal seed to two to three times longer than normal seeds. The sclerotial stage is preceded by a ""honeydew"" stage in which a sticky mass of conidia oozes from infected florets.


","

1) Plant ergot-free seed.

2) Rotate field out of susceptible grasses.

3) Control annual bluegrass or other  species

4) Remove as much ergot as possible from the field during harvest. Ergot can be removed later during seed cleaning.

5) Destroy screenings containing ergot. If buried, they must be more than 3 inches deep.

6) Use resistant cultivars or ones that flower only a short time.

7) Prevent heading in pastures or in field margins.

8) Open field burning will reduce but not eliminate ergot. Propane burning has not proven effective.

Grass for Seed,"Nematode, Grass Seed Gall or Seed Gall","Several species of the nematode genus Anguina can affect orchardgrass, annual ryegrass, bentgrass, and fescue. Recent DNA studies point to the likelihood of a different Anguina species evolving on each susceptible grass genus. These studies also suggest that Anguina agrostis may be limited to infecting only bentgrass. DNA testing can be used to identify the Anguina nematodes to species.
Anguina is believed to infect orchardgrass during the wet conditions (winter through spring in the Willamette Valley). Juveniles emerge from the gall after the gall wall has degraded or broken, migrate to orchardgrass plants, and invade the base of tillers. The nematodes induce small galls within the base of tillers, where they differentiate into males and females and lay eggs. Juveniles hatch from the eggs and migrate from the basal galls to the developing panicle to infect ovaries. By the time panicles emerge in the spring, galls have already been initiated, and conspicuous seed galls may form. Infected seeds contain many hundreds to several thousand juveniles that will serve as next year's inoculum source. Disease usually increases slowly over time and often occurs in localized areas of the field. Yield loss can become quite significant in bentgrass or annual ryegrass fields and occasionally in fescue fields, but in most cases it is primarily a phytosanitary issue.
These nematodes have also been shown to serve as phoretic hosts for Rathayibacter rathayi (see Grass for Seed - Rathay's Disease). Under certain conditions, this bacterium and related species can produce glycoproteins that are neurotoxic to livestock. Consumption of seed screenings with high levels of these glycoproteins has been reported to produce sheep staggers in the Pacific Northwest and Australia.


","In bentgrass, infected seeds form large, spike-shape black galls, three to ten or more times longer than healthy seed. Numerous galls in a seed head gives the floret an irregular appearance. In annual ryegrass, infected seeds form black, spike-shaped galls that are the same size or slightly smaller than healthy seed. Fescue galls are very difficult to detect in the field. Infected orchardgrass seeds are nearly asymptomatic; galls are rarely reported though orchardgrass plants may be stunted.


","

1) Use only -free seed to establish new plantings of orchardgrass, bentgrass, and fescue.

2) Seed galls can be easily transported on equipment, shoes, and pant cuffs, etc. Practice proper sanitation.

3) Because the host range is limited, grass-free rotation for 1 year will greatly reduce or eliminate seed gall nematodes from grass seed fields.

4) Mow to prevent seed head formation.

5) Reduce the return of galls back to seed fields by removing lightweight seed after seed is harvested from field (during subsequent cleaning).

6) Open field burning reduces the number of galls within residues exposed to fire, but galls that fall within the crowns or are covered by soil will likely escape the high temperatures required to kill nematodes. Open burning to control  should be as soon as possible after harvest. Propane burning may not be effective since temperatures may not be high enough to kill .

Grass for Seed,Powdery Mildew,"A fungus, Blumeria graminis (syn. = Erysiphe graminis; anamorph Monilia hyalina), that overwinters on infected plants or as chasmothecia associated with debris and is most commonly observed on tall fescue, fine fescue, and Kentucky bluegrass but all cool season grasses are susceptible, including native perennial grasses. Spores can be dislodged easily and spread by wind. Cool, humid, cloudy conditions favor spore development and infection. Powdery mildew develops over a wide temperature range but is most rapid between 59°F and 70°F. The disease generally is most severe in spring and autumn.


","Isolated colonies of fine, whitish mycelia on leaves and leaf sheaths. It spreads rapidly under favorable conditions to form a dense white to light gray mass of spores on upper and lower leaf surfaces. Older leaves tend to be more heavily infected than young ones.

Grass for Seed-Purple Eyespot ,(Mastigosporium Leaf Spot),"Mastigosporium rubricosum, a fungus that overwinters as mycelium in infected leaves and affects orchardgrass, bentgrass, and timothy. Conidia develop from overwintered mycelium and are disseminated in water and wind. The fungus requires cool, wet weather to infect hosts. The disease is most severe in the cold, rainy, or foggy weather of winter and early spring.


","Leaf spots appear as small, dark purple or brown flecks on leaves. Flecks may enlarge to form elliptical spots with ash-gray or brownish centers. Spots may become gray with red or purple borders. Leaf spot is commonly observed on orchardgrass in winter and early spring. It is the earliest of the common leaf spots to appear in orchardgrass (scald and gray streak are the two others). During the season, the disease does not move much up the plant or into the head, but it can contribute to leaves' early death.


",,"This disease seldom, if ever, needs control in grass for seed. Scald and gray streak cause much more damage; therefore, the decision to spray should rest on the progress of those diseases, not of purple eyespot.


",
Grass for Seed-Rathay's Disease ,(Bacterial Head Blight),"A bacterium, Rathayibacter rathayi (formerly Corynebacterium rathayi), that is seedborne in orchardgrass and survives in affected debris and soil. It does not spread rapidly through a field or appear to affect seed yield except in years with heavy rain during orchardgrass heading. Rathayibacter depends on the Anguina sp. nematode (see Grass for Seed - Nematode, Grass Seed Gall or Seed Gall) in orchardgrass to infect plants. Rathayibacter adheres to the Anguina and is carried into the plant as the nematode migrates among leaf sheaths to the base of the plant. The nematode infects the developing panicle, carrying Rathayibacter to the infection site. Anguina sp. infects the ovary and replaces the seed with a gall containing nematodes but in some cases Rathayibacter will overtake the Anguina and discrete, lemon yellow colored galls will be produced instead of the nematode galls. More commonly, as Rathayibacter proliferates, a yellowish, slimy mass exudes from infected florets. Anguina nematodes do not survive the excessive bacterial growth.


","A gooey, sticky mass of yellow-orange material is visible on seed heads and this later dries to a brittle, glass-like covering. The panicle is the only organ of the plant affected but the yellow exudate can stick to leaves or stems. Yellow-colored galls that replace seed galls from Anguina can also occur.


","Control of Rathayibacter has not been established but control of Anguina is believed to control Rathay's disease (see Grass for Seed - Nematode, Grass Seed Gall or Seed Gall). Removal of infected residues after harvest by baling is believed to reduce the level of Rathayibacter. In addition, burning is assumed to destroy infested residue.

Grass for Seed,"Rhynchosporium Scald, Leaf Spot, and Head Blight","At least two species of Rhynchosporium scald fungi. Rhynchosporium orthosporum infects bentgrass, fescue, orchardgrass, ryegrass, and bluegrass; R. secalis is best known as the cause of scald in barley, but it can also infect bentgrass and ryegrass. Rhynchosporium scald is one of the more common causes of leaf spot on orchardgrass, perennial ryegrass, and tall fescue in winter and spring. Now it also is known to cause head blight in orchardgrass, which, in the early 1980s, Selenophoma fungi were thought to cause. Head infection by the scald pathogen is less common in other grass seed crops than in orchardgrass. All orchardgrass cultivars are susceptible, but early ones are subject to more damage.
The pathogen survives as dormant mycelia in living plants or plant debris. Scald fungi sporulate profusely in wet conditions, releasing conidia that are splashed or blown to uninfected tissue. Prolonged cool (55°F to 65°F), wet, cloudy spring weather favors the disease. Only a day or two of moisture is needed for the conidia to germinate. New mycelia then infect the plant and produce more conidia. Symptoms do not appear for 10 to 14 days after infection. Rainy weather into May favors head blight in orchardgrass.


","Early symptoms include small water-soaked lesions with irregular margins. Lesions enlarge and coalesce to form irregular shaped blotches with defined margins. Color of the blotches varies with grass host and may include light brown, grayish brown, or reddish-brown. Leaves often die from the tip downward.
Head blight in orchardgrass after heading, lesions appear on the stem and panicle that are pale brown with dark borders. Lesions girdle the panicle branches and often are intermixed with healthy green areas, producing a ""barber pole"" effect.


","

1) Field burning has little effect on this disease, but practices that delay heading and reduce lodging may help.

","The key to reducing damage in orchardgrass is to prevent infection of the flag leaf and head. Once scald lesions are on the panicle, it is too late to control the disease, and yields will drop. Apply a fungicide at least once to orchardgrass seed fields at boot stage or very early head emergence, even if weather has been relatively dry. In a rainy spring apply twice: first at boot stage, then at early head emergence. Applications at flowering are less effective.


1) Bravo Ultrex at 0.9 to 1.4 lb /A. One (1) or two (2) well-timed applications of Bravo are more cost-effective than three (3). There has been no advantage to tank-mixes of Bravo and Tilt unless rust is also a problem. Do not apply within 14 days of harvest. Do not allow livestock to graze treated fields. 12-hr reentry.

Grass for Seed,Root and Crown Rot,"The fungi, Fusarium sambucinum, F. culmorum, and F. avenaceum, have been found on orchardgrass plants in Oregon seed production fields. Other Fusarium species are known to pathogenic on turf grasses: F. acuminatum, F. crookwellense, F. equiseti, F. graminearum, F. heterosporum, and F. poae, and these other fungi may be encountered in bentgrass, annual bluegrass, Kentucky bluegrass, Chewings fescue, red fescue, tall fescue, hard fescue, annual ryegrass, and perennial ryegrass.
All of these Fusarium spp. can survive on infected grass plants, in plant residues, and some of these fungi may persist as a durable spore form in the soil. These Fusarium spp. can colonize other plant types, especially other grassy species.
Under warm, wet conditions pathogenic Fusarium spp. will produce spores, which can be moved by wind or water. Infections of root or crown may occur ""rapidly"" but it may be weeks or months before Fusarium crown and root rot is observed; crown and root rot are more obvious during hot, dry weather as plants die. Crown and root rot are promoted by stress, such as that caused by heat, drought, and over-application or unbalanced applications of N.
Warm, wet conditions favor leaf spot and seedling diseases when pathogenic Fusarium spp. are present. When humid conditions persist during cool weather, leaf blight may occur.


","Root and crown rot is first evident by a dry, dark brown rot in root, rhizome, stolon, or crown tissues. Affected plants turn light green then tan and finally brown as these plants die. Crown rot can lead directly to tiller death. If warm, moist conditions arrive, sometimes affected plants will exhibit whitish to pink fungal growth on the lower stem or crown. Leaf spots are not necessarily present on plants suffering from Fusarium root and crown rot but can be incited by these fungi. Leaf spots tend to develop on older leaves first. Leaf spots are usually tan or light brown and are irregular in shape. Spots can appear water-soaked with brownish-purplish borders.


","Minimizing stresses on plants will aid in managing crown and root rot. Chemical means for managing crown and root rot are not effective. Leaf spot doesn't usually require protective fungicide applications in Oregon.

1) Reducing plant residues can help to decrease the pathogen population and subsequent disease. If residues are deeper than 2 inches, mechanical removal is recommended in turf situations.

2) Proper applications of nitrogen (levels and balance of ingredients) can decrease rank growth and decrease problems with leaf spot, leaf blight, and rot of crowns or roots. Maintain proper soil fertility, including soil pH and available calcium, for these factors are important for vigorous root and subsequent shoot growth.

3) Irrigation during dry periods should decrease crown and root rot by reducing plant stress. Water thoroughly but only as needed, avoid overwatering.

Grass for Seed,Rusts,"Puccinia brachypodii var. poae-nemoralis, a fungus that survives as mycelium from season to season in infected foliage. Primary inoculum is urediniospores produced in pustules on overwintering sources; secondary inoculum is produced in pustules from primary infections. Several urediniospore cycles can occur in a growing season. Teliospores are two-celled and develop with urediniospores in fall; they often are covered by epidermis.


Puccinia coronata, a fungus that overwinters on infected plants. Primary inoculum is urediniospores; secondary inoculum (urediniospores) is produced in initial pustules and disseminated by wind. Teliospores are two-celled and are produced in late summer. (The term ""crown"" is associated with the teliospore, not with a location on a plant.) The top of the spore is broad with a ""crown"" of finger-like projections.
Crown rust develops on leaf surfaces when free water is present and temperatures range from 65°F to 72°F. Epidemics are favored by urediniospore dispersal in warm temperatures (about 75°F to 80°F), in conditions that allow persistent dew formation. Survey seed production fields repeatedly to prevent a buildup of crown rust before applying fungicides to susceptible cultivars.


Puccinia crandallii, a fungus that survives from season to season on infected plants. Primary inoculum is urediniospores; secondary inoculum (urediniospores) is produced in initial pustules and disseminated by wind.


Puccinia graminis subsp. graminicola, a fungus that overwinters as slow-growing mycelium in overwintering plants. In spring, the fungus resumes more vigorous growth and produces primary inoculum (urediniospores) that are windborne. Initial pustules often are few and scattered and may be difficult to see because new plant growth obscures those formed within the plant canopy. Urediniospores from these sources produce secondary inoculum, which infects the same or other plants, and the disease spreads. Epidemics result from repeated sporulation cycles (production and spread of urediniospores). After seed harvest and as plants continue to grow, black teliospores are produced within the pustules formerly occupied by reddish brown urediniospores.
This disease develops when free water (rain or dew) is present on plant foliage and temperatures are above 50°F. At 50°F, time for a urediniospore-to-urediniospore cycle varies for cultivars but usually requires 13 to 17 days. At 65°F and above, the disease develops rapidly, and cycles of urediniospores can be produced in 8 to 9 days. Once the pustule ruptures, urediniospores are disseminated and infect other plants or newly exposed plant surfaces. At higher temperatures, cultivar differences in the rate of disease development are less apparent. Because urediniospores are produced and disseminated rapidly, disease cycles often overlap on the same plant or within the same field.


Puccinia striiformis, a fungus that overwinters on infected plants. In spring, primary infection is from windborne urediniospores produced on infected plants. Secondary spread continues from subsequent infections. As the season passes, urediniospore production drops or ceases; black teliospores are produced instead.
On bluegrass, the disease may develop rapidly when free moisture (rain or dew) occurs and temperatures range between 50°F and 55°F. Nearly every year it can be found as early as January or February.
On orchardgrass, the disease is most serious when free water is present and temperatures are 70°F to 75°F. In most years, stripe rust is not epidemic in orchardgrass because higher temperatures are required for growth and increase. However, in low spots in a field or during early warm weather, the disease can be serious.


","Pustules occur mainly on the lower surfaces of leaf blades but also develop on leaf sheaths. Urediniospores within the pustules are yellow-brown or reddish-yellow.
Crown Rust


Pustules occur as small, scattered blisters on upper and lower surfaces of leaf blades, but they also may appear on leaf sheaths. The epidermis along the margin of the pustule is slightly raised but not ragged like stem rust pustules. Urediniospores are bright orange-yellow. Urediniospore lesions (pustules) sometimes develop in stripes, which causes confusion with stripe rust in field diagnosis. Microscopic examination of urediniospores and teliospores is needed for proper diagnosis.
Fine Fescue Rust


Pustules hold masses of dark-reddish-brown urediniospores that form on both sides of the leaves, on leaf sheaths, and on spikes or panicles. In early-season or light infections, pustules often are scattered and separate. In late-season or heavy infections, pustules often coalesce. As pustules develop, bubble-like blisters form on the surface; they feel rough to the touch. After pustules break through the epidermis, surface tissues look ragged and torn.
Stripe Rust


Pustules contain yellow to orange-yellow urediniospores that form in narrow, linear stripes on leaves' upper sides. Pustules also are on stems, the leaf sheath, and the outer and inner side of the glumes.


","

1) Many turf-type cultivars with crown rust resistance have been released.

2) Late planting in the fall or spring planting reduces stem rust in the first year of perennial ryegrass.

","The USDA-ARS has developed a stem rust model that predicts rust activity based on scouting findings and the model can be found on the Stem Rust Website at http://pnwpest.org/cgi-bin/stemrust1.pl . If the rust model is not used, begin applying fungicide when first rust pustules appear; repeat every 7 to 10 days for contact fungicides or every 14 to 21 days for systemic fungicides. Spray dates may vary due to yearly variations in rain and temperatures. Applications at flag leaf emergence, even if rusts are not visible, can help in a year when rust does not develop fully due to low temperatures.
Kentucky bluegrass-one (1) to three (3) applications for stripe rust control beginning about April 15 to 20.
Perennial ryegrass-one (1) to three (3) applications for stem rust control beginning about May 20 to 25.
Tall fescue-one (1) to three (3) applications for stem rust control in late-blooming cultivars harvested in late June or early July. Fewer applications needed for early-blooming cultivars.
Although there are no documented fungicide-resistant rusts in grass seed fields, rotating fungicides with different modes of action may reduce the potential for resistance to develop. There are now fungicides labeled that provide an effective rotation program.

Grass for Seed,Septoria and Stagonospora Leaf Spots,"Septoria spp. (teleomorph: Mycosphaerella) or Stagonospora spp. (teleomorph: Mycosphaerella), fungi that survive winter and summer as mycelia or pycnidia (minute, black, flask-shaped fungal structures) in infected debris. These fungi attack a broad range of hosts, including bentgrass, bluegrass, fescue, and ryegrass. Bluegrass is more susceptible than other grasses. Many species of Septoria exist and may cause leaf spots on other grasses as well.
Conidia reproduce from pycnidia in cool, wet periods in spring and autumn. Rain splashes conidia to healthy tissue. Some of these fungi also have a sexual stage, produced in perithecia on straw in spring and fall. Also, spores from the straw can be airborne for long distances.
The disease is most common in cool, wet weather. Infection requires a film of water on the leaf surface. Septoria spp. have not caused extensive damage on tall fescue and perennial ryegrass seed crops. Serious damage has occurred in bluegrass occasionally.


","Leaf spots vary in color and could range from gray to dark purple. Septoria spp. can cause leaf spots, streaks, or blotches. As lesions enlarge, they become straw-colored, and leaf tips may become chlorotic and mottled. Small, dark pycnidia appear in the dead areas of older lesions.

Grass for Seed,Silvertop,"Several insects, including thrips, stem borers and plant bugs, cause physical damage and/or inject plant toxins during feeding. Poa species and, to a lesser extent, orchardgrass are affected. The fungus Fusarium poae is associated with silvertop but only after damage has been done.


","Affected seed heads die and bleach white, appearing to mature early. Stems of affected heads can be pulled easily out of the leaf sheath if stem-boring insects are involved. Plant bugs often cause the stem to shrivel and turn brownish just above the uppermost joint. Affected heads do not set seed.


","

1) Burning fields after harvest has reduced incidence of this disease when caused by plant bugs.

","Insecticides may reduce incidence of silvertop. See the PNW Insect Management Handbook for details.


",
Grass for Seed,Slime Molds,"Myxomycetes (Physarum spp., Fuligo spp., and Mucilago crustacea) that live in the soil or thatch and are favored by wet weather and an abundance of leaf litter. The appearance of slime mold (sporangia) can cause great concern but is not considered a disease and will recede after 1 to 2 weeks. Sporangia persist in the soil or litter where they have fallen, and they germinate during or after wet conditions. They release motile swarm spores (amoeba-like), which feed on the decaying organic litter as well as on bacteria and other microorganisms. Upon depleting their food source, they change morphologically, forming a plasmodium that grows up from the soil/litter onto the plant. They will grow up virtually any erect surface and when moist, give a ""slimy"" feel to the plant. The sporangia are then produced, and their presence is the only readily visible portion of their life cycle in the grass seed field. Slime molds can reappear year after year.


","Leaves will be covered with a grayish or purplish brown, or a white mass of small, round fruiting bodies (sporangia). The plant does not develop any symptoms; the affected leaves don't normally die or turn yellow. The presence of the slime mold interferes with photosynthesis by shading the leaf, but unless the plant is covered heavily, the grass plant usually isn't weakened.

Grass for Seed,Smuts,"Two fungi, Tilletia caries (formerly T. tritici) and T. laevis (formerly T. foetida), which are carried on seed or may survive a year in soil.


A fungus, Tilletia controversa, which survives as spores in soil or in smut balls in seed.


A complex of closely related smuts, the most important of which is Ustilago bullata. Head smut appears before harvest as powdery spore masses. Often it is called ""loose smut"" to distinguish it from kernel smut. Spore masses disperse in wind. Spores infect seed embryos at flowering. Spores may be on receptive floral parts or on the surfaces of nearby flowers. When infected seeds are planted, the fungus grows systemically within the host.


Fungi in the genera, Tilletia and Sphacelotheca. Spores from infected seeds are distributed to adjacent seeds and into soil. Spores on infested seed germinate when seed sprouts; infection occurs through immature seedling tissue. The fungus continues to grow within the plant and eventually infects the flowers. Rotation may be ineffective because spores of some species remain viable in soil 10 to 25 years, depending on species.


A fungus, Ustilago striiformis. Plants are infected by spores that are seedborne or in soil or thatch. Primary infection occurs when spores germinate and infect seedlings; then, the fungus spreads within the plant. Dissemination occurs when contaminated seed is planted or when vegetative cuttings from infected mother plants are used to establish new plants. Spores can spread locally on contaminated machinery, such as combines, mowers, and dethatchers. If conditions become unfavorable for growth, the fungus goes dormant. When cool conditions return in spring and fall (about 50°F to 68°F), the fungus resumes growth and invades newly developed tissue.


","No symptoms are apparent until the crop heads. In infected heads, all or part of the kernels are replaced by light brown smut balls filled with dark brown spore masses. When smut balls are crushed, a distinctive, foul odor is obvious.


Infected plants are stunted, the heads a quarter to half as high as healthy heads. Kernels are replaced by smut balls containing masses of dark spores with a foul odor.


Infection can lead to reduced seedling establishment. Internodes are shortened in many grasses, producing an erect, short stem with a compact panicle (dwarfed). A loss in seed production and in forage production due to stunting also can occur. At flowering, ovaries in infected plans are converted to masses of spores covered by thin membrane. When the membrane breaks, brown or black spore masses are released.
In kernel smut (see below), spore masses form only in the ovaries, causing smut balls. This usually differentiates the disease from head smut.


Infected plants are stunted. As they grow, their ovaries are replaced by spore masses held together by the pericarp (part of the seed coat); these often are concealed by the glumes. When spore masses ripen at the end of summer, the kernel breaks and releases light to dark brown spore masses with a ""rotten fish"" smell.


Spores form into long, narrow, gray to black stripes in leaves and leaf sheaths. Leaf surfaces appear shredded after spore dispersal, and individual infected plants die, particularly during summer, causing fields to look ragged.

Grass for Seed,Stem Rot,"Unknown, but it is suspected that physical damage caused by thrips as the females insert eggs individually through the epidermis of the stem opens up the stem area to invasion by pathogenic bacteria. If bacteria are responsible, they likely survive in infested residues. This problem has been observed since before the mid-1990s in orchardgrass but is not considered to be yield limiting.


","The primary symptom is death of inner stem tissues, and panicle may not emerge from boot. Affected stems appear healthy green in outer tissues, but the panicle appears tan while inner stem tissues are brown, soft, and somewhat sticky. Eventually the stem completely dies and turns brown. Affected plants often appear stunted.

Grass for Seed,Take-all,"A fungus, Gaeumannomyces graminis var. tritici, which lives in soil or diseased grass stubble. Grass seed fields are seriously affected in western Oregon and Washington, especially during wet years in fields with a heavy straw load.
Infections is favored by soil at 50°F to 68°F and moist conditions. The severity of infection by flowering, soil moisture levels after flowering, and fertility program all strongly influence yield losses. Liming of moderately acidic soils increases disease incidence.


","The stem's base is covered with a coal-black fungal growth under leaf sheaths. Individual roots turn coal black and are coal black on the interior when scraped. Plants are stunted, mature early, and have white, empty heads. Some tillers may fail to head.


","

1) Crop rotation with at least one year out of grass or wheat is very effective at reducing the pathogen population. Vegetables, corn, annual legumes, and oilseed crops are non-hosts.

2) Bury grassy debris to ensure breakdown of infected plant residues.

3) Maintain good nitrogen levels. Using ammonia forms of nitrogen and chloride fertilizers lessen yield losses when soil pH is near 5.5. When soil pH is 5.2 or less, liming can aid, especially when low phosphorus (P) levels prevail.

",,
Grass for Seed,Twist,"A fungus, Dilophospora alopecuri, that infects fine fescue and overwinters in infested residues or soil and may be seedborne. Dark colored fruiting bodies (pycnidia) develop and aggregate between veins on older leaves and leaf sheaths. Conidia are produced and dispersed by rain splashing.


","Twisted or malformed seed heads. Portions of shoots or leaves may be enveloped with a black fungal stroma. In some cases white, deformed or twisted heads may emerge from the boot. Somewhat resembles leaf smut.

"Greenhouse Plants, Ornamental",Black Root Rot,"Thielaviopsis basicola is a widely distributed root pathogen reported from at least 30 plant families, including many ornamental plants. Untreated or improperly treated field soil can be a source of T. basicola if used in potted-plant culture. Most soilless media including commercial peat moss are clean. T. basicola spores from other areas of a greenhouse facility can contaminate potting media and result in disease problems. The pathogen forms thick-walled chlamydospores, which can survive several years in soil. Root exudates stimulate chlamydospores to germinate in soils whose pH ranges from 5 to 8.5, and root rot tends to be more serious in plants grown in neutral to alkaline soils. Root rot also generally is more serious for plants grown in soil at 55°F to 70°F but can be severe on some plants at as high as 77°F. Disease severity tends to be worse when temperatures are not optimal for plant growth, and the soil moisture-holding capacity is 70% or above for extended periods.
Plants that frequently develop black root rot include Begonia sp., Cyclamen persicum, Euphorbia pulcherrima (poinsettia), Fuchsia x hybrida, Gerbera jamesonii (African daisy), Pelargonium x hortorum (florist's geranium), Pericallis x hybrida (cineraria), Scindapsus aureus, and Viola spp. (pansy). Alyssum, kinnikinnick, Lithodora, marigold, petunia, phlox and Vinca also have problems with black root rot.


","Aboveground symptoms are not unique to T. basicola but are typical of many root diseases or soil conditions that are detrimental to root growth. Plants often are chlorotic and stunted and may wilt if root rot is severe. Initially, roots or portions of roots killed by this pathogen are brown and could be mistaken for Rhizoctonia root rot. The diagnostic flat, black root lesions occur because of the abundant formation of chlamydospores on the root surface and in the root cortex. Multiple root diseases, such as Pythium, Rhizoctonia, or Thielaviopsis root rot, can occur coincidentally with black root rot.
The fungus can be seen in infected tissue with a compound microscope. The fungus can be isolated readily by spreading a thin layer of soil or colonized root tissue over 5-mm-thick carrot root disks in sterile dishes. Sterile water is then atomized over the disks to moisten the soil or roots; after 2 to 4 days at room temperature, the incubated disks are rinsed with water and incubated again. If the fungus is present, endoconidia form in about 6 days followed by chlamydospore formation. Bead-like chains of endoconidia can be observed with a dissecting microscope.


","Ruthless sanitation and proper environmental controls are necessary of successful disease management. Fungicides will not compensate for poor sanitation or environmental controls.

1) The disease is greatly reduced at pH levels below 5.5. Some plug producers adjust media pH, however, finished plants often are grown in commercial peat mixes that are buffered at a pH between 6 and 6.5. Also, note that plants like geranium and marigold naturally drop the growing media pH while petunias tend to naturally increase the media pH.

2) Use soilless planting media. If field soil is a component of the growing medium, treat it with steam (122°F for 30 min) or chemical fumigants.

3) Dispose of diseased plants and plant material promptly.

4) Do not let contaminated tools or hands contact sterilized planting media.

5) Keep entire propagation and growing areas clean.

6) Control fungus gnats and shore flies, which may serve as vectors. Consult the  for currently effective tactics.

7) After the production cycle, remove any remaining plants and disinfect the growing area.

8) Avoid reusing pots or trays from a previous crop for propagation. If pots must be reused then wash off all debris and soak in a sanitizing solution or treat with aerated steam for 30 min.

"Greenhouse Plants, Ornamental",Gray Mold,"Botrytis cinerea (sexual: Botryotinia fuckeliana) and other Botrytis spp., fungi that colonize dead, dying, and wounded plant parts. From these infections they can attack healthy tissues. A moist, humid environment is ideal for pathogen sporulation and spread. Spore dispersal is stimulated by changes in relative humidity. Conidia may come from many sources in and outside the greenhouse. Concentrations peak in the greenhouse during irrigating, spraying pesticides, harvest, and shipping. It is found everywhere plants are grown and has a wide host range wide host range including African violet, Ageratum, Ajuga, Aphelandra, aster, begonia, Caladium, Calceolaria, carnation, chrysanthemum, coleus, cyclamen, fuchsia, geranium, gloxinia, hosta, Iberis, impatiens, lily, Lobelia, marigold, orchid, pansy, Pericallis hybrids, petunia, poinsettia, primrose, rose, snapdragon, verbena, viburnum, zinnia, and zygopetalum. Geranium is considered highly susceptible to a point that it could be a significant harbor of the pathogen for other greenhouse crops. Flower petals are most susceptible at any stage of development. Blossom blight, leaf spots, and bud and stem rots are common. Leaf blights can start when infected floral tissue falls on healthy leaves. Plant parts, such as roots, corms, rhizomes and stems, in cold storage can also be injured.


","Blighting of leaves, petioles, blossoms and stems is the most common symptom. Initial infections, particularly of petals, appear as water-soaked brown to tan spots. In humid conditions, a fuzzy fungal growth, brown to gray, appears around the infected plant part. Infections move quickly to healthy tissues under ideal conditions. Blossom infections may cause petals to fade and die prematurely. Crown rots, stem cankers, cutting rots and damping-off are other problems that can occur due to this fungus.


","An integrated strategy combining environmental management, cultural practices, and fungicides will most effectively manage this disease.

1) Thoroughly clean and sanitize the greenhouse before production.

2) Remove all dead and dying plant parts (particularly blossoms) on and around plants and take them out of the greenhouse. Many growers use closed containers to minimize the amount of conidia.

3) Maintain a steady, relatively dry environment by keeping greenhouse humidity below 90%, increasing spacing between plants for good air circulation, and taking care not to splash water on foliage during watering. Heating the greenhouse at night or venting around sunset may be necessary. Heating in the morning before sunup can also help prevent dew formation as air temperature increases faster than the temperature of plant parts.

4) Spacing plants also allows better light penetration, reducing senescence of the lower leaves and thus helping reduce the amount of highly susceptible plant tissue.

5) Eliminate weeds from inside the greenhouse and around doorways and vents outside of the greenhouse.

6) Avoid leaving large stubs on stock plants after cutting.

7) Place fans in greenhouse to get better air circulation.

8) Forcing dry air for 2 days on cut geranium stock plants, beginning within hours of cutting, significantly reduced gray mold.

9) Covering greenhouses with long-wave, infared-absorbing plastic film may help by reducing greenhouse cooling at night. Other coverings that increase the blue: UV ratio can inhibit sporulation of some  isolates but is highly variable between crops and isolates of the fungus.

","Fungicides do not compensate for poor sanitation or environmental controls. Resistance to many different and multiple fungicide groups has been documented worldwide. To prevent developing resistant fungi, alternate or tank-mix materials from different groups with different modes of action. Also, limit applications from any specific group to two (2) or fewer sprays. A bioassay using the sunflower 'Sunspot' will detect fungicide resistance.

"Greenhouse Plants, Ornamental",Impatiens Necrotic Spot,"Impatiens necrotic spot virus (INSV), formerly the I strain of Tomato spotted wilt virus. Affects more than 50 different greenhouse ornamentals. It is especially destructive to aster, begonia, chrysanthemum, cineraria, cyclamen, dahlia, exacum, fuchsia, gloxinia, New Guinea impatiens, pansy, and stephanotis. African violet, Ageratum, Calceolaria, Coleus, Delphinium, geranium, hosta, Lobelia, marigold, petunia, primrose, snapdragon and Verbena can also have problem with this virus.  It is transmitted by thrips, especially by the western flower thrips. Immature thrips (larvae) get the virus when feeding on diseased plants and spread the virus as adults when feeding on healthy plants. The virus multiplies in the plant but may not be distributed evenly. INSV overwinters in infected plants such as weeds or those held over in greenhouses. These plants are reservoirs of the virus from which it can spread again in spring. If not recognized at an early stage, the entire greenhouse planting could be lost.


","TSW and INS symptoms can mimic those of fungal, bacterial, or other viral infections. Both viruses can produce necrotic (dead) spots on leaves, black or discolored areas that follow leaf veins, general or spotty chlorosis (yellowing), black or purple stem streaks or leaf spots, falling of leaves or buds, leaf distortion, blackening of young leaves and growing points, stunting, and colored spots, stripes, or rings on petals, leaves, or fruit. The ringspot symptom is often seen.
Plants infected while young are the most severely affected. Symptoms range from dramatically obvious to no symptoms at all under certain conditions. Most infected plants tend to show the most obvious symptoms during cool weather or low light. An infected plant may not display symptoms at all during warm, high-light, rapid-growth periods. It is also common to find infected plants with only a few symptomatic portions while most of the plant looks normal.


","

1) Have suspected diseased plants tested for the virus. On-site tests are commercially available to detect this and several other viruses.

2) If the virus is present, destroy all infected plants and remove them and their potting soil (which contains the thrips' pupae) from the greenhouse range. Also rogue out any diseased plants as thrips are attracted to sick plants.

3) Use light blue or yellow sticky traps to monitor thrips. Place one (1) sticky trap per 500 to 1000 sq ft just above plants. Check traps weekly and keep accurate records of when and where thrips are trapped. WFT are more attracted to browallia (), gloxinia (), impatiens (), and verbena (  hybrida) than other floricultural crops.

4) Keep vegetatively-propagated plant material separate from seed-grown plants, if possible, to reduce the chance of an unintentional introduction.

5) Remove weeds under benches.

6) Place indicator plants in each house where thrips may land. A number of petunia cultivars including Calypso, Summer Madness, and Super Blue Magic are good INSV and TSWV indicators. The fava bean 'Toto' also can be used.

7) Separate greenhouse ranges with plastic barriers. Screen or net air intake vents. Use double-entry door construction.

8) Workers should avoid wearing light-color clothing such as yellow, blue, and white.

","Sticky traps and spot treatments are part of an integrated control-monitoring program. Consult the PNW Insect Management Handbook for currently effective materials.

"Greenhouse Plants, Ornamental",Powdery Mildew,"Many different named fungi but all are related with a similar life history and applicable management tactics. The following have been found in the PNW including but not limited to Erysiphe aquilegiae (formerly Erysiphe polygoni), Golovinomyces cichoracearum (formerly Erysiphe cichoracearum), Golovinomyces orontii (formerly Erysiphe cichoracearum), Podosphaera delphinii (formerly Sphaerotheca humuli var. fuliginea), Podosphaera fusca (formerly Sphaerotheca macularis), and Podosphaera violae (formerly Sphaerotheca macularis). These are highly specialized pathogens that form a close association with the host. Conditions that favor the host also tend to favor the pathogen. The disease is favored by low light, warm conditions (60 °F to 80°F) and cool nights. Overcrowding of plants is also favorable for disease development. Repeated outbreaks affect plant vigor and production.
These fungi may survive in sexual fruiting bodies (chasmothecia) associated with plant debris and/or as mycelia within infected buds. Sources may be inside or outside the greenhouse including, among other sources, the introduction of new (diseased) plants. Conidia that develop within colonies are released in response to abrupt decreases in relative humidity. Air currents blow conidia to healthy foliage where they start new colonies. Spores can germinate within 6 hours at 68°F and establish an infection within 24 hours. However, temperatures above 85°F inhibit the process. Too much water, such as flowing water or rain, destroys spores by causing them to burst. The fungus does not grow in a leaf or flower but rather across the surface. Small anchor cells of the fungus, haustoria, do grow into the leaf and take nourishment from the plant, but the main filament and the multitudes of spores it produces are outside the leaf. Temperatures of 70°F are optimal for colony development; however, temperatures >85°F are inhibitory to hyphal growth, sporulation and haustorial formation. The disease can develop under relatively dry conditions in spring and summer so long as the air is humid. Multiple disease cycles can occur during a single  growing season.


","Symptoms may vary widely. Early development can be subtle on the leaf surface and best seen on the leaf underside. Upper leaf surfaces may show only slight chlorosis in diffuse spots. Turning the leaf over can reveal a sparse to heavy mycelial growth that can be white to gray. Early symptoms can be easier to find when the sun is over the back of your shoulder highlighting the colony. In other cases, a dense white powdery coating may form on leaves, stems, and/or flowers. All aboveground plant parts can become infected including the flower stalk and petals. New infections are typically bright white then become gray with age. In severe infections, reddish margins of dead tissue may surround the spots. Leaves may be somewhat deformed if they are infected before they have fully developed. Infected plant parts may be dwarfed and stunted. Some premature defoliation may also be observed. Plant vigor and stem quality can be reduced. The disease may be confused with spray residues, especially if using electrostatic sprayers.


","

1) Start with healthy stock plants.

2) In some cases there may be resistant cultivars, which will be very useful if you have a history of powdery mildew.

3) Good air circulation will help ensure uniform environmental growing conditions for the crop including both 'uniform' temperature and lighting. Space plants so they are not overcrowded and circulate the air in the greenhouse using fans.

4) Keep relative humidity low.

5) Scout plants weekly. On one out of 30 plants, inspect four fully expanded leaves in the middle of the plant. If powdery mildew is found, scout one out of 10 plants.

6) Remove and destroy infected plant parts. (Seal in plastic before disposal so infected tissue does not move throughout the greenhouse.) General greenhouse sanitation will help with overall disease management.

7) It is thought that high greenhouse temperatures (greater than 85°F) may be used to help control an outbreak if powdery mildew occurs early in the production cycle. This also will be dependent on the tolerance of your crop to such temperatures.

8) Eliminate any volunteer plants that may be growing under benches, between greenhouses, or on cull piles.

9) Brief exposure to red light with red light-emitting diodes during the dark period reduced the severity of powdery mildew on greenhouse grown roses. Exposure to ultraviolet light during the night had a similar effect. These tactics may be useful in some cases in the PNW.

"Greenhouse Plants, Ornamental","Pythium Seed Rot, Damping-off, and Root Rot","Pythium species are common soilborne pathogens that infect seeds and roots of many greenhouse crops. Some of the more common species include P. aphanidermatum, P. cryptoirregulare, P. irregulare, and P. ultimum, but other species may also be present. All Pythium species are strongly favored by abundant moisture and can be especially problematic in poorly drained potting media. Pythium usually attacks seeds or seedlings in the greenhouse. However, cuttings and older plants may also be affected, especially if the potting media is too wet or placed on a poorly-drained surface. Substrate temperatures above 77°F favor the development of some Pythium spp. such as P. aphanidermatum.
Pythium spp. can survive in dust, planting media, or soil particles on greenhouse floors, flats, and pots. Wood benches can also be a reservoir. Spread can also occur via movement of infected plants. Damaged plants are more easily infected. It enters roots damaged by high soluble salts, either from overfertilization or from letting the rooting medium dry out, even for short periods, during propagation.


","First symptoms often include poor seed germination and emergence referred to as damping-off. Seeds become soft, shrivel, and disintegrate. If germination occurs, very young, small seedlings appear to suddenly collapse and die. Older seedlings develop brown to gray, water-soaked lesions at or below the soil line. Often the lower part of the stem withers before the upper stem and leaves causing infected seedlings to fall over on top of the soil. Disease progression can be very rapid and spread to adjacent healthy seedlings. In extremely moist conditions, white cottony fungal growth may appear on the surface of the seedlings and the soil.
Cuttings rot from the base and roots may fail to develop. Occasionally, roots will develop immediately above the rotted area where the rooting medium is drier.
Older plants can appear stunted or chlorotic, and may wilt even when enough water is available for growth. Diseased roots are discolored brown and/or appear water soaked. Fine roots turn mushy and slough off leaving mostly thicker, older roots behind. The root cortex of the smaller roots can often be easily slipped off, thus leaving a white cylinder of vascular tissue behind.


","Good greenhouse hygiene will help reduce risk of these diseases. Make cleanliness a priority. Avoid disease-promoting conditions such as poor sanitation, inadequate drainage, and inappropriate irrigation.

1) Always use disease-free planting materials. If cuttings are used for propagation, obtain them only from healthy plants. If stock plants are in the field, avoid taking cuttings from branches close to the ground, as these could be contaminated.

2) Rooted plants acquired from other nurseries should be inspected and placed in a quarantine area where they can be held and monitored for disease development for a few weeks.

3) Cuttings acquired from other nurseries should be inspected, disinfested and planted as soon they arrive.

4) Use new pots, trays, or treat any reused items with a disinfectant, use steam, or solarization techniques (such as with anti-condensation film) to clean them.

5) Use soilless growing media that is stored under cover in a concrete bay or in some other clean and sealed container kept dry, cool, and in a low-light environment.

6) Growing media could be treated by steam (140°F for 30 minutes), solarization (double-tent at 160°F for 30 minutes or 140°F for 1 hour), or chemically. Storage area surfaces should be easy to clean and disinfest. This could include metal or plastic bins, trailers, trolleys, in bags on a sealed surface, or racks under cover.

7) Use ground sources for irrigation and avoid surface water sources for propagation of the crop.

8) Good drainage and water management are essential components of a management plan. Ensure growing media and holding areas are well drained.

9) Avoid soil moisture conditions of 70% or higher.

10) Do not overfertilize or let plants dry out. Monitor soluble salt concentrations regularly.

11) Avoid rough handling of plants, especially when starting and ending the crop.

12) Remove diseased plants immediately and carry out rigorous hygiene measures to prevent further spread.

13) Remove crop residue and old or low-quality plants that will not be marketed as they can become sources of inoculum.

14) Replace wood benches or potting tables for ones made of plastic or wire that will facilitate cleaning and disinfestation.

15) Regularly sterilize any tools used in propagation or pruning using 70% alcohol solution or quaternary ammonium-based products.

","Fungicides are best used as protectants in combination with cultural controls. Once symptoms are observed, the disease is difficult to control. Therefore, prevention is key. Rotate among fungicides with different modes of action to help prevent fungicide resistance from developing.

"Greenhouse Plants, Ornamental",Shoot Proliferation and Leafy Gall,"The bacterium Rhodococcus fascians is a Gram positive actinomycete. It is capable of infecting at least 44 plant families and can infect woody and herbaceous plants, both dicots and monocots. It most frequently affects herbaceous perennials. There have been field observations, which imply that populations of R. fascians may persist for one or two years in association with infested plant material in soil in which diseased plants have been growing. By themselves, the bacteria are very short-lived in soil. R. fascians will move in water, although this is a passive process as these bacteria have no ability to move on their own. On infected plants, bacteria are primarily limited to the surfaces of the leaves, petioles and stems, although some underlying cells also become infected. There is no evidence that R. fascians can systemically infect plants. Taking cuttings from infected plants and irrigating with infested water are the primary ways by which the disease is spread. The pathogen can remain viable in irrigation water for as long as 90 days in the absence of a host, and plants may become infected from either roots or foliage that has come into contact with infested water. The bacteria can be present on plant surfaces for months before symptoms develop. Wounds are not necessary for infection to occur.
Plants commonly affected include Acanthus sp. (bear's breech), Argyranthemum sp., Aster sp., Geranium sp. (crane's-bill), Heuchera sp. (coral bells), Hosta sp., Iberis sp., Leucanthemum x superbum (Shasta daisy), Lily, Monarda sp., Nemesia sp., Pelargonium spp., Petunia spp., Veronica sp., and Viola sp. There appear to be distinct differences in the ability of various strains to infect various hosts.


","A proliferation of partially expanded buds or shoots is common with many plant species, as are leafy galls, which are dense clusters of shortened stems. Symptoms may be confused with those caused by crown gall bacteria (Rhizobium radiobacter), virus infection, herbicide damage, or eriophyid mite infestation. On hosta, abnormal bulbils form at the base of the stem. Plants affected by this bacterium often grow with less vigor, have an abnormally short stature, may produce fewer flowers, and may have less root growth, although this varies with the plant species. Plants may harbor R. fascians without showing symptoms.


","Disease management depends on prevention. Once the plant is introduced into a greenhouse, sanitation is extremely important.

1) Start with clean plants and do not take cuttings from symptomatic plants or plants in close proximity to diseased plants. Use disease-indexed, tissue-culture-derived plants for those cultivars that appear particularly susceptible.

2) Use new planting trays and pots. Used ones must be washed free of all organic debris before treating with a disinfectant.

3) Potting mix or field soil should be pasteurized (60 minutes at 160°F aerated steam) before use.

4) Knives or razor blades should be changed or sterilized between plants during propagation.

5) Keep plants off the greenhouse floor and solid surfaces; bench tops should allow water to drain freely. Runoff water can disperse the bacteria.

6) Immediately remove and destroy any diseased plants plus any neighboring plants or trays. Clean up and discard all old leaves and other plant debris.

7) Minimize the length of time leaves are wet; apply irrigation under conditions where leaves can dry in 1 to 2 hours. Good ventilation will help.

","The bacterium can be found internally within plants to a limited extent, so topical applications of bactericides will not eradicate the bacterium. There have been no chemical trials conducted to determine efficacy of control compounds. Grower experience; however, has indicated that using copper-based products on plants may be useful under some conditions such as protection of uninfected plants.

"Greenhouse Plants, Tomato-Common Mosaic of Tomato ",(Internal Browning of Fruit),"Tobacco mosaic virus, which also affects pepper, eggplant, petunia, and many other plants. Poor sanitation and handling infected plants are the primary means of spread.


","Symptoms depend on the virus strain. Often, foliage mottles with alternating yellowish and dark green areas. New leaflets curl and are slightly malformed. More severely affected leaves are badly distorted and rather fern-like. Plants usually are somewhat stunted and bear few fruit if infected when young. Plants and fruit are not much smaller if plants are infected after they reach fruiting stage. Sometimes necrotic spots or streaks develop on stems and leaves.


","

1) Use resistant varieties.

2) Do not use tobacco products while handling plants. Wash hands thoroughly with soap and water after smoking and before touching plants.

3) Early in the season, remove and destroy all affected plants, fallen leaves and other debris from infected plants. Roguing later in the season is not effective.

4) Use only sterilized pots, flats, and planting media.

5) Do not handle healthy plants after touching infected plants.

"Greenhouse Plants, Tomato",Gray Mold,"Botrytis cinerea, which also causes gray mold in ornamentals. It can appear on any aboveground plant parts.


","Affected tissue in high humidity usually is covered with the fuzzy gray-brown conidiophores and conidia (spores) of the fungus. Infections often begin on flowers and spread to fruit, leaves, and stems. Leaf lesions rapidly cover the entire surface. Infection can go into petioles and stems, which, if severely affected, may be completely girdled, killing tissue above the canker. Stem cankers have a distinctive brown and tan target-spot pattern.


","

1) Remove all dead and dying plant parts from the greenhouse. Do not leave them in garbage containers in the greenhouse.

2) Keep relative humidity at less than 90%, increase plant spacing, and do not splash water on foliage while watering.

3) Use fans to increase air circulation.

4) A calcium:phosphorus ratio of 2 or higher (measured in the leaf petioles) aids in control.

"Greenhouse Plants, Tomato",Leaf Mold,"Fulvia fulva (formerly Cladosporium fulvum), a fungus.  Spores resist drying and may survive in the greenhouse several months after plants are removed. The fungus is most destructive when humidity is high (90% to 100% at the leaf surface) and the temperature is 65°F to 80°F. The disease usually will not be severe if the relative humidity at the leaf surface is kept below 90%.


","White spots that rapidly enlarge and become yellow appear on the upper surfaces of older leaves. The patches' lower surfaces become covered with a velvety, olive-brown fungus growth. When the disease is severe, much of the foliage is killed, and the crop is greatly reduced.


","

1) Leaf mold can be kept under control if ventilation is ample and air circulation good in the houses.

2) Maintain temperature at 60°F to 65°F, at least. Heat at night, when outside air drops below 60°F, to control humidity increases that come with lower outside air temperatures.

3) Varieties reported resistant to some strains of the fungus include Santa Fe, Globelle (pink fruit), Bay State (red fruit), and Vetomold (red fruit).

",,
"Greenhouse Plants, Tomato",Oedema,"Physiological. Oedema (edema) is more prominent when ambient temperatures are lower than soil temperatures and soil moisture and relative humidity are high. Low transpiration rates along with a rise in water absorption increase cell pressure, erupting epidermal cells so that inner cells enlarge and protrude. That causes the inner cells to die and discolor (yellow, brown, or rust), giving the impression that a parasitic organism is involved.


","Symptoms appear primarily on lower leaf surfaces. The disorder shows up first as small, clear, watery blisters (0.06 inch in diameter), which can be very numerous. As blisters dry, they turn opaque and usually reddish brown. Oedema is unsightly but not a serious threat to the health of affected plants.

Hawthorn ,(Crataegus spp.)-Rusts,"Several fungi in the genus Gymnosporangium cause rusts on hawthorn. G. clavariiforme and G. libocedri have been reported from Oregon; from Washington, G. clavipes; and for all states including Idaho, G. bethelii. The rusts are throughout North America wherever perennial hosts (mainly juniper) grow near the deciduous hosts (members of the rose family, including hawthorn, Amelanchier, cotoneaster, apple, pear, quince, and Sorbus). Spores that form on hawthorn are usually shed in mid- to late summer and infect juniper. Juniper galls release orange spores in spring, which are blown to nearby hawthorns and other hosts. These spores infect newly opening leaves and tender young fruit. Spore stages produced on the junipers or cedars infect only hawthorn and members of the rose family in early spring but can be produced repeatedly over 2 to 3 years from one infection.


","Leaves, fruit, and sometimes twigs are infected, causing conspicuous leaf spots (bright yellows to oranges) and defoliation as well as fruit and twig deformities. When infections on hawthorn mature, hair-like (tubular) spore-bearing structures (aecia) extrude from the tissue. Juniper infections usually appear as swellings or galls on twigs and produce orange spores in spring.


","

1) Check the vicinity for infected juniper; if they have no value, remove them.

2) If you are growing both hosts as crops, separate them as widely as possible. Prune out any visible galls or swellings on juniper before spring and remove visible infections on hawthorn or other deciduous hosts before they sporulate in summer.

","Protect new growth when infections on juniper are sporulating in spring, sometime between mid-March and mid-May depending on weather and location.

One part, side or section of the tree may be affected at first. This corresponds to the side that is supported by the roots first attacked by the fungus. Trees may live for a number of years before finally dying. White mycelial plaques or fans can be seen on the main roots or root crown when the outer bark is removed. Rhizomorphs may also be found clinging to the bark in this area. These appear as dark-brown-to-black, branching, root-like structures.

Hazelnut ,(Corylus avellana)-Bacterial Blight,"Xanthomonas arboricola pv. corylina (formerly Xanthomonas campestris pv. corylina), a bacterium that attacks buds, leaves, branches, and trunks. Occasionally it attacks nuts but seldom invades roots. Tree mortality due to this disease is commonly found in orchards the first few years after planting. The most serious phase of the disease is trunk girdling and killing of trees up to 8 or 10 years old where generally only 1- and 2-year-old twigs are attacked and killed. Rain splash or the movement of infected nursery stock spreads the bacteria. Seedborne transmission has been reported but no data is presented to support the claim. Infections are indirect, through wounds or by bacterial invasion of blighted buds and shoots of current-season growth. The disease has been associated with high stress sites and dryland production.
In Italy, higher disease incidence was found in regions with higher rainfall and a greater difference between high and low temperatures during frost events. They also found higher disease incidence for soils with higher nitrogen levels.


","Small, angular or round, yellowish green, water-soaked spots develop on leaves, later turning reddish brown. Buds may turn brown and fail to leaf out. Shoots may develop but are infected. The first infections on current-season stems consist of dark green water-soaked areas on bark, which turn reddish brown. Lesions may girdle stems and kill them. Dead leaves often cling to girdled stems a long time. Lesions or cankers may extend into the main scaffold or trunk. Use a pocket knife to determine the extent of canker development. Lesions may be wet and ooze in spring.


","

1) Plant pathogen-free nursery stock in early winter. Do not let roots dry out.

2) Prune out infected twigs and branches. Make cuts 2 to 3 ft below affected branches. Soak pruning tools between cuts with shellac thinner (70% ethyl alcohol), 10% Clorox (which is corrosive), Lysol, ZeroTol, Oxidate, or X3. Disinfestants work better on clean equipment with long contact times. Use the two pruners method: having one soaking in the solution of choice while using the other; then switch pruners, leaving the one you just used to soak, and the one that had been soaking, to continue pruning. If used as a soak, change solutions every 2 to 3 hours.

3) Control sunburn during summer using shields or white paint on trunks.

4) Mulch around the base of newly planted trees with chipped, composed tree debris to reduce moisture stress.

5) Irrigate during the first 3 summers after planting to reduce moisture stress.

6) Apply nitrogen fertilizer in the spring based on leaf tissue analysis the prior August.

","Apply sprays in late August or early September before the first heavy rains. If fall rains are heavy, apply another spray when 75% of the leaves have dropped. Note that most copper products do not allow use until after harvest.

Hazelnut ,(Corylus avellana)-Blanks,"The official definition of blanks is a shell containing no kernel at all or a kernel filling less than one-fourth the capacity of the shell. Pollination stimulates the shell to develop, but the kernel, for unknown reasons, fails to develop normally. The kernel either fails to grow at all, or it starts to grow but then aborts. Pollination failure is not the cause; if pollination had failed, the shell would not have developed at all. The cultivar Barcelona produces a higher proportion of blank nuts than other cultivars.
Feeding due to the Brown Marmorated Stink Bug early in kernel development has resulted in an increase in blank nuts.


","No kernel in the hazelnut shell. Kernels may develop a short time but then shrivel. These also are considered blank nuts. Blanks generally fall from the tree earlier than shells with kernels. Shells are much easier to crack open and may become necrotic.


","None is known beyond growing cultivars that inherently develop fewer blanks.

",,
Hazelnut ,(Corylus avellana)-Brown Stain,"Unknown. Possibly a physiologic problem because no insects or pathogens have been associated with this problem. Severity of the problem changes from year to year.


","Brown stain is characterized by a brownish liquid that soaks the side or apical end of the nut. Staining begins when nuts are about half grown. The first symptoms are water-soaked spots between the vascular bundles on the shell that are softer than normal. Soon spots become brown to dark brown and sunken. Internal areas are affected later, producing a water soaking around the developing kernel. The entire interior of the shell, including kernel, may turn into a soft, brown, watery mass. Kernels may also be misshapen.


","None is known.

",,
Hazelnut ,(Corylus avellana)-Catkin Blast,"Unknown. No investigations have been reported. The cultivar Barcelona tends to show it more than other cultivars, but it is on fewer than 5% of the catkins. The problem is widespread throughout the Willamette Valley in Oregon and has been found in British Columbia. No adverse yield effects have been linked to this problem. Although the big bud mite will blast open dormant buds, no mites have been associated with these deformed catkins. Another theory blames hot weather during catkin formation.


","Part of the catkin prematurely opens in late summer but does not elongate. It is observed generally on the terminal portion of the catkin. The result is a bent or curved catkin that looks swollen on the end. Pollen also is shed from the deformed catkins.


","None known. Most likely, none is necessary.

",,
Hazelnut ,(Corylus avellana)-Eastern Filbert Blight,"Anisogramma anomala, a fungus that has infected hazelnut orchards throughout the Pacific Northwest. The fungus has a life cycle of 2 or more years including a 12- to 15-month latent period when no symptoms are visible. In spring, spores are forcibly ejected and released in a sticky, white ooze in wet weather. Wind-driven rain and splashing droplets spread spores to young, developing shoots. Infection occurs in wet weather from budbreak through shoot elongation. Spores penetrate immature epidermal cells in the region behind the meristem where cell elongation occurs. Neither wounds nor natural openings on hazelnut trees have been shown to serve as sites of entry for the fungus, and it is not spread through the nuts.
Stroma begin to develop the second summer after infection. Ascospores begin to mature in fall as the rainy season begins. Several hours of continuous rain are needed for ascospore release. Stroma will continue to sporulate, even after the diseased branch has been removed from the tree, until the canker dries out completely. Ascospores are shed all winter but cannot infect hazelnuts until spring. Cankers on large scaffold limbs, trunks or resistant cultivars may not produce stroma. New stroma develop each year as the canker continues to expand around and along the branch. Numerous new infections also occur each succeeding year.
The pollinizer 'Daviana' and the cultivars Ennis and Du Chilly are highly susceptible to this disease. 'Casina' is susceptible as is 'Negret' and most wild or escaped seedlings. The main industry cultivars Barcelona, Butler, Hall's Giant, and Willamette have intermediate susceptibility. 'Lewis' and 'Clark' have quantitative resistance but can become infected through repeated exposure to EFB. 'Dorris', 'Jefferson', 'McDonald', 'Santiam', 'Wepster', and 'Yamhill' are highly resistant with the single dominant-resistance gene from 'Gasaway'. These cultivars may get cankers but at a low frequency, be smaller, and may not produce spores. Some, but not all, of these cankers will heal over in succeeding years. The Turkish hazel (C. colurna) has resistance to EFB.
Contorted ornamental hazelnuts can also be infected. The ornamental cultivar 'Burgundy Lace' and the red leaf contorted cultivar 'Red Dragon' also have the single dominant-resistance gene from 'Gasaway'. The native Corylus cornuta var. californica and C. cornuta var. cornuta do not appear susceptible to the disease. Strains of Anisogramma anomala from Eastern North America can overcome the single dominant-resistance gene bred into new cultivars. There are restrictions in Oregon on commercial and ornamental hazelnut cultivars imported from out-of-state (OAR 603-052-0825).


","Infected branches may die suddenly from July to September. Dead leaves may stay on the branch. Elongated, raised bumps begin to form on infected twigs and branches in June. When the bark is removed, the cambium below the bumps is chocolate-brown. Bumps continue to expand until the fungus breaks through the outer bark in July and August. A white, oval to football-shape fungal structure called a stroma can be seen then. As the stroma matures from August to October, it turns black and raises about 0.12 inch above the branch. Stromata are in relatively straight rows lengthwise along the branch. Cankers enlarge along the branch each year, from a few inches on small branches up to 3 ft on larger branches of susceptible trees. Branches die back when expanding cankers girdle branches and limbs.
Most of the canopy of susceptible trees is usually dead within 7 to 15 years after the first infection (if diseased limbs are not removed). Suckers, however, may be produced for many years. Although orchards decline in vigor and health, they may continue to be productive. Tree productivity declines slowly at first but then sharply after 3 to 10 years depending on the cultivar. At some point the orchard becomes economically unproductive as the more susceptible pollinizers or main cultivars die out, resulting in poor nut set.
The disease may be confused with Eutypella cerviculata, which produces smaller black fruiting bodies on dead branches. This fungus produces diagnostic black rings under the bark, which can be detected using a pocket knife. Cicada egg laying scars can also look somewhat like eastern filbert blight but are not black and look stitched.


","An integrated approach using several cultural and chemical techniques is needed for adequate disease control. Scouting for cankers twice a year is very useful; early detection aids overall control.

1) Plant resistant cultivars.

2) Thoroughly inspect new orchards for 2 years after planting to find trees that may have been infected prior to planting.

3) Replace susceptible pollinizers with highly resistant ones such as the VR series, 'Gamma' (compatible with 'Barcelona'), 'York', 'Felix' (compatible with 'Ennis'), 'Delta', 'Epsilon' or 'Zeta' all of which have the single dominant-resistance gene from 'Gasaway'. Also, reduce the number of susceptible pollinizers to 4% or 5% of the trees in the orchard.

4) Remove or destroy escaped seedlings and trees beyond the orchard perimeter.

5) Remove infected branches 1 to 3 ft below cankered area, and burn, bury or chip before budbreak in spring. Remove severely infected trees.

6) Start sucker control early in the season.

","A total of four (4) applications is recommended to adequately protect trees. Apply starting at budswell to budbreak and continue at 2-week intervals to cover an 8-week period. Thorough coverage of all branches is essential. Spray each row; however, for the first application only, alternate row applications may provide acceptable coverage. The disease kills trees slowly, so the yield benefits obtained from fungicidal protection are not realized for 3-to-4 years after application. Alternate or tank-mix fungicides from different groups with different modes of action. The addition of a surfactant, if allowed by the label, will improve disease control.
Cultivars, such as Jefferson or McDonald, with the single dominate gene for resistance need protection at least the first spring after planting when located near heavily infected orchards.

Hazelnut ,(Corylus avellana)-Kernel Molds,"""Mold"" is defined as any visible growth of mold either on the outside or inside of the kernel. In practice, it means any white, fuzzy mycelial growth is classified as 'mold.' Research on specific causes of 'mold' is lacking. Many different fungi are easily isolated from the shell or kernel, with surface sterilization, with or without any specific symptoms, before or after harvest. Many of the following fungal problems would only be classified as decay or discoloration in the absence of active mycelial growth.
Several fungal species are consistently associated with kernel molds. Ramularia endophylla is consistently isolated from kernels with tip mold. A Phomopsis sp. and Septoria ostryae (formerly S. coryli) are commonly associated with internal discoloration. Nematospora coryli, a yeast, is consistently associated with the disease known as kernel spot. Several other fungi have been isolated from shriveled hazelnuts. These organisms may be secondary opportunists that invade kernels that have been stressed physiologically, but all have been associated with kernels at shelling. Koch postulates have not been completed for any of the associated fungi. An insect vector such as Lygus bugs may be involved with yeasts.
In Oregon, moldy kernel incidence averages 0.5% to 1% annually; mold incidence in individual orchards frequently is much higher (3 to 10%). Fungi reduce kernel quality, but the degree varies with the causal agent and environmental conditions during symptom development. Mold is often highest if rains are significant in spring or during harvest. Mold can also be a problem when bins filled with nuts are grouped together and left out in the rain before drying.
The cultivars Lewis and Santiam generally have higher levels of mold than Barcelona in any particular year. Susceptibility to kernel mold is highly heritable and can be minimized when selecting new cultivars.


","Most mold symptoms develop between nut maturation and when kernels are dried postharvest. The most common symptom in Oregon is a necrosis of the kernel tip where it attaches to the funiculus. Necrosis usually extends into the kernel a few millimeters. Kernel tips are blackened and shriveled, partly reducing kernel quality.
Internal discoloration of the kernel is another common symptom. Affected kernels change from a normal, opaque white to a translucent, buttery yellow and have a bitter, rancid flavor. The buttery yellow symptom is not always apparent on the kernel surface.
Lesions on the kernel surface characterize kernel spot. Lesions are dark, sunken, and varied in size and shape. All surfaces of the kernel can be affected. Kernel shriveling in combination with sporulation of fungi on the kernel surface is another defect.


","

1) Delay mechanically flailing the orchard floor until as late in spring as practical.

2) Harvest, dry, and shell kernels quickly after they fall to the ground.

3) Correctly adjust sweeper and harvester settings to reduce the amount of debris (sticks, leaves and husks) and soil (mud) that ends up in totes with harvested nuts.

4) Harvesting before fall rains has been associated with reduced mold counts. Mold counts appear to increase 1 to 2 weeks following a fall rain.

5) Totes or boxes full of harvested nuts should be kept out of the rain while awaiting processing. Any practice that increases air flow around totes will also keep additional mold from developing.

6) Plant early-maturing cultivars.

Hazelnut ,(Corylus avellana)-Leaf Spots,"There are a number of fungi that can cause leaf spots on hazelnut. These are of minor importance in commercial production and are more common in native hazelnuts, hedgerows and abandoned orchards. Anthracnose is caused by Piggotia coryli and leaf blister (and leaf curl) by Taphrina coryli. Cylindrosporella coryli (formerly Phyllosticta coryli) , Septoria ostryae, Anguillosporella vermiformis, and Mamianiella coryli also cause various leaf spots.


","Anthracnose varies from inconspicuous brown spots to relatively large, irregularly-shaped chlorotic lesions that cause premature senescence. Bud rot and catkin necrosis have also been attributed to this fungus in Europe.
Phyllosticta coryli can cause small, circular, yellow leaf spots with pycnidia arranged in a central ring in the lesion. Septoria ostryae has similar symptoms but pycnidia are more scattered.
Anguillosporella vermiformis will produce large, confluent, brown spots.
Mamianiella coryli will produce small, circular, yellow patches with green islands on the top of leaves in late summer. Small black stromata form in the centers of the leaf spots and are easily seen on the lower leaf surface. Protruding from the stromata are long beaks of immersed perithecia.


","In general, these are not serious and do not warrant special control measures. Sanitation of leaf debris in the fall, pruning for better air circulation or fungicide applications in the spring might be useful if needed.

Hazelnut ,(Corylus avellana)-Mosses and Lichens,"A number of mosses and lichens grow on hazelnut, walnut, and fruit trees. None are parasitic. Control may be desirable because ice or snow may accumulate on mosses and lichens and break branches. If orchards are regularly pruned or sprayed, usually mosses or lichens are few or nonexistent. If plantings are not sprayed regularly for other reasons, spray thoroughly every 4 to 5 years to control mosses and lichens. Dead mosses and lichens will stay on trees for a time but gradually weather away.


","Nonvascular plants cover or hang from small twigs or larger branches. Mosses have leaves that are only one cell thick but they do not have true roots, flowers, or fruit; instead of seeds, they have spores. They may form green carpets and cushions. Lichens do not have a stem-and-leaf structure, and few of them are bright or deep green. Rather, lichens come in shades of gray, cream, pale green, olive green, yellow, and orange.

Hazelnut ,(Corylus avellana)-Powdery Mildew,"Phyllactinia guttata, a fungus that overwinters on fallen leaves and fallen infected twigs. Erysiphe corylacearum has been reported on Corylus californica. The conidia are readily wind disseminated. Chasmothecia develop within the external hyphae and form appendages late in their development. The uneven wall thickness and bulbous nature of the appendages allows the entire cleistocarp to be dislodged from the host. When dry, the appendages flex like a spider's legs and allow the cleistocarp to be dislodged and carried by wind.


","White powdery growth appears on the leaves' undersides but often not until late in the season. Small, round, black fruiting bodies (chasmothecia) also may be seen on the white growth. The disease causes little or no economic damage, and infected leaves seldom fall prematurely.

Causes investigated include soilborne fungi, nematodes, and nutrition. The disease is similar to hazelnut yellows, caused by a phytoplasma found only in Europe. The disease spreads very slowly in the field, possibly through root grafts. The cultivars Barcelona and Du Chilly are the only cultivars known to be affected.


","Early symptoms include dull yellow-green, smaller than normal leaves. Leaves are very small and sparse in succeeding years. Shortened internodes and dwarfed foliage give branches a bottle-brush look. Roots lack fine root hairs. Symptoms may be mild to severe. Trees may have symptoms for years with occasional branch dieback. Trees eventually decline and die over decades.

Hazelnut ,(Corylus avellana)-Sunburn,"Environmental. Hazelnut bark is very susceptible to damage from full sun in summer. Newly planted trees or thick branches exposed to full sun after heavy pruning are at highest risk of damage and need protection. Wood-rotting or heart-rot fungi can colonize these areas and further weaken the tree. Young sunburned trees are also attractive to the Pacific flatheaded borer.


","Necrotic leaves and trunk or limb cankers on the tree's southwest side. Most severe on young trees or trees that have been pruned back severely.

Hazelnut ,(Corylus avellana)-Wet Feet,"Hazelnuts will not tolerate saturated soil conditions for extended periods of time during the winter. Trees grow poorly under these wet conditions for years and eventually may die.
The OSU Plant Clinic has detected the fungus-like microorganism Phytophthorafrom the fine roots of young, dying trees. Although this is considered rare in hazelnuts, Phytophthora is a common root rot organism found on many other plants growing in saturated soil conditions.


","Trees growing in low areas of the orchard or swales are of low vigor and slow growing relative to other trees in the orchard. Trees may survive for many years in these areas but remain stunted and do not produce as many nuts. Some trees will continue to decline with a dieback of twigs and branches and eventually die.
Phytophthora infection can result in discolored roots and vascular cambium as it colonizes the roots and root crown. Fine roots are discolored and decayed with loss of the root cortex. Young trees may not survive the first year or two after planting and die. Mature trees may develop a dark wet stain on the lower trunk. These areas may weep a dark fluid in the spring. Diseased and discolored cambium will extend down to and below the ground rather than up and into the branches. General decline symptoms above ground of yellowing, branch dieback, and nutritional deficiency will occur from lack of functioning roots. Trees may show lack of vigor and suddenly crash during the summer when hot weather prevails.


","First determine the soil type and structure, as that will help guide the choice of corrective measures.

1) Plant trees on well-drained soils.

2) Tile low areas of the orchard for improved water drainage.

3) Avoid reusing pots from a previous crop for propagation. If pots must be reused then wash off all debris and soak in a sanitizing solution or treat with aerated steam for 30 min.

","Phytophthora root rot might be controlled using the following products that are effective on other crops. Only use when diagnosis is confirmed. These chemicals will not keep heavily infected trees from dying.

Hazelnut ,(Corylus avellana)-Wood Decay,"Most fungi that cause extensive wood decay of nut trees are classified in the phylum Basidiomycota. These fungi produce various basidiocarps, such as mushrooms and conks, containing basidia. Basidiospores are forcibly discharged from basidia and usually are disseminated by air currents. Wood decay fungi enter trees primarily through wounds that expose sapwood or heartwood. Injuries from pruning, sunburn, lightning, or cultivating equipment can expose susceptible wood. Large wounds, stubs and horizontal cuts are often entry sites for decay fungi. Mycelial growth of the fungus proceeds with colonization and utilization of wood as a food source. Basidiocarps develop after extensive colonization of the substrate in a suitable environment and under suitable physiological conditions. Asexual spores are not commonly produced.
Wood decay generally is observed in older trees after extensive fungal colonization, but it also can occur in young trees. Decay fungi frequently function as secondary invaders following a succession of microorganisms, including bacteria, yeasts, and other fungi. Decay in a single tree may be caused by more than one fungal species.


","Two types of wood decay occur in living trees: white rots and brown rots. White rots cause moist, soft, or spongy wood that is a lighter color than sound wood. All major structural components of the cell wall-cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin -are degraded. The strength of white rotted wood decreases only in advanced stages of decay.
Brown rots of wood are brown, dry, and crumbly, with longitudinal and transverse cracks. Most of the cell wall polysaccharides are degraded, but the lignin component is unchanged or slightly modified. The strength of brown rotted wood is significantly reduced or lost entirely shortly after decay begins. These rots usually are in exposed wood and can cause extensive damage, resulting in structural failure.
Wood decay leads to limb breakage, uprooted trees, trees broken at the soil line during windstorms, or decreased tree vigor and dieback.


","

1) Help prevent wood decay by using cultural practices that promote tree growth and vigor while minimizing injuries that expose wood.

2) Irrigation water, especially from sprinklers, should not wet the trunks.

3) Cultivation and mowing equipment should not injure the roots, crown, or lower trunk.

4) Make pruning cuts adjacent to, but not into, the supporting branch, and prune when branches are small to enhance callus formation and wound healing.

Heather ,(Calluna spp.)-Root Rot,"The fungus-like microorganism Phytophthora cinnamomi has been reported frequently in Oregon. Waterlogged soils and warm temperatures favor the disease. It survives unfavorable periods in soil and within plant debris. Under favorable conditions, spores germinate and infect roots. After infection, the fungus-like microorganism spreads mainly in the inner bark tissues of the root and stems. They survive as various spores in the soil, container media, or infected roots. Movement of infected plants and/or soil can spread this microorganism.


","First, the leaves on one or more branches fade, wilt, and die. Foliar symptoms usually are localized, but the entire plant soon dies. Roots are fewer, shorter than normal, and becomes reddish brown as the organism advances up into the root crown. Severe dieback, leaf chlorosis, and defoliation have been observed in New Zealand.

Hebe,Downy Mildew,"Peronospora grisea, a disease that typically occurs on plants crowded together in moist, shaded environments. In nursery production, plants that are overwintering under plastic are susceptible, particularly if they are placed too close together and if the young plants become rootbound. Overhead irrigation that keeps leaves wet can also favor the disease. The disease is rare in the landscape in the Pacific Northwest but plants can be infected that are subject to heavy shade. The disease has also been observed on potted plants grown in coastal areas that are subject to summer fog.


","The disease is usually noticed first by a yellowish discoloration of the leaves, often on the lower leaves of the plants. This discoloration can affect large portions of individual leaves. Leaves become curled and distorted. A fuzzy fungal growth may develop on the underside of the leaves. Eventually the affected parts of leaves turn brown and shrivel. Plants can be entirely defoliated and killed.


","

1) In the landscape, ensure that plants are well-spaced and in full sun.

2) Avoid overhead irrigation unless the foliage can dry quickly and thoroughly.

3) Removal of individually affected leaves or stem sections can assist in plant recovery.

4) In nursery production, avoid crowding plants together while overwintering in plastic hoop-houses.

Hebe,Root Rot,"There have been several organisms associated with root rots and resulting branch diebacks in Oregon including Phytophthora sp. and Fusarium oxysporum. Both are favored by excessively wet soils but Phytophthora is favored by cool soils conditions while Fusarium is favored by warm soil.


","Root rots are usually first noticed by the flagging of individual stems, often in mid-summer. Leaves on these stems turn yellow then brown. Entire sections or sides of the shrub may become affected quite rapidly, looking almost as though it were burned. Plants may be stunted. Roots below affected branches are rotted. The entire plant may die, or it may persist for months in this state.

Helleborus,Black Death,"'Black death' has been reported in a number of states in the Western and Eastern United States as well as other countries. Although the cause of 'black death' has not been determined definitively, evidence points to a virus as the probable causal agent, specifically a Carlavirus tentatively assigned the name Hellebores net necrosis virus (HeNNV). HeNNV is genetically distinct from other viruses detected in hellebores such as Hellebores mosaic virus, Cucumber mosaic virus, Tomato spotted wilt virus and Chrysanthemum virus B. None of these other viruses have been associated consistently with 'black death' symptoms. HeNNV is serologically related to other Carlaviruses including Hellebores mosaic virus. HeNNV has been detected in the pollen of symptomatic flowering plants, but little is known about the potential for pollen transmission of this virus. Symptomless infection may play a significant role in widespread dissemination of the 'black death' causal agent.
A limited number of aphid species have been demonstrated to colonize hellebores, one or more of which may serve as vectors of the Carlavirus. The hellebores aphid (Macrosiphum hellebori) has been recovered more frequently than other aphids on symptomatic hellebores plants in the Pacific Northwest, but this aphid remains to be verified as the vector of HeNNV. The crescent-marked lily aphid (Aulacorthum circumflexum) and the violet aphid (Myzus ornatus) have also been found to colonize hellebores.
Symptoms of 'black death' have been reported primarily on the various cultivars or hybrids known as Helleborus x hybridus (formerly H. orientalis). Little is known about the susceptibility of other hellebores species, but symptoms have not been observed on H. niger or H. argutifolius.


","Symptoms typically develop on well-established (older) plants, particularly on newly emerging foliage and on flowers (usually in mid-winter or early spring). A variety of symptoms have been observed in association with 'black death,' the most common including blackened leaf veins; dark brown to black streaks on petioles; black streaks on flower bracts; and stunted, brittle, brown to black new growth. Black streaks may occur as ring spots or lines and, when severe, are associated with distortion and stunting of affected plant parts. Vein marking initially appears as light-colored thin lines but progresses rapidly. Infected plants are severely stunted. Depending on the virus isolate and hybrid line, the plants may linger in poor health for several seasons, or may die within weeks. Plants may be infected for 1.5 or more years prior to developing symptoms. Symptomatic plants do not recover. In the early stages of infection, the symptoms of 'black death' can be confused with leaf spotting caused by Botrytis, Coniothyrium, or Phyllosticta.
Symptoms of other virus problems include line patterns in the foliage (TSWV), mottling and rugose foliage (CMV).


","Control tactics are based on the likelihood that HeNNV causes 'black death' by means of systemic infection.

1) Purchase clean stock.

2) Growers should dig up and destroy symptomatic plants.

3) Control of aphids may help prevent spread of the causal agent of 'black death.' See the  for details.

Generally called water molds because they produce a swimming spore stage (zoospore) that is attracted to roots. They survive as various spores in the soil, container media or infected roots. Western hemlock (T. heterophylla) and mountain hemlock (T. mertensiana) are highly susceptible, particularly in poorly drained areas of a nursery. There are many other potential hosts of these organisms.


","Seedlings' lateral roots are fewer and shorter than normal. Normally white cambial root tissue becomes reddish brown as the organism advances up the roots into the root crown. There may be no visible aboveground symptoms the first year of infection. The spring after infection, chlorosis, stunting, wilting, and browning of the needles can occur. Symptoms can be confused with soil compaction, mechanical damage, or nematode damage.

Hemlock ,(Tsuga spp.)-Wood Decay,"Two types of wood decay occur in living trees: white rots and brown rots. The more common fungal white rots in hemlock are caused by Ganoderma applanatus (white mottled rot), Ganoderma oregonense (spongy white rot), Phellinus nigrolimitatus (white pocket rot), and Porodaedalea pini (red ring rot). White rots cause all major structural components of the cell wall-cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin-to degrade. The strength of white rotted wood decreases only in advanced stages of decay.
The more common fungal brown rots in hemlock are caused by Antrodia serialis (brown cubical pocket rot), Echinodontium tinctorium (brown stringy rot), Fomitopsis officinalis (brown trunk rot), Fomitopsis pinicola (brown crumbly rot), Laetiporus sulphureus (brown cubical rot), and Phaeolus schweinitzii (red brown butt rot, sometimes called the cow pie fungus). Brown rots cause most of the cell wall polysaccharides to degrade, but the lignin component is unchanged or slightly modified. The strength of brown rotted wood is significantly reduced or lost entirely shortly after decay begins. These rots usually are in exposed wood and can cause extensive damage, resulting in structural failure.
Injuries from pruning cuts, sunburn, or storm damage can expose susceptible wood. Large wounds, and stubs. and horizontal cuts are often entry sites for decay fungi. Wood decay generally is observed in older trees after extensive fungal colonization. Decay fungi frequently function as secondary invaders following a succession of microorganisms, including bacteria, yeasts, and other fungi. Decay in a single tree may be caused by more than one fungal species.
Some root rots, such as those caused by Armillaria sp., or Heterobasidion sp., or Perenniporia subacida can also extend up into the trunk and cause wood decay.


","White rots cause moist, soft, or spongy wood that is a lighter color than sound wood. For Ganoderma oregonense (spongy white rot), the rot is a soft, spongy, white rot containing numerous black spots scattered throughout. The annual conks measure up to 2-feet across and are usually shelf-like. The reddish-black to black upper surface is lacquer-like, while the lower, pore-bearing surface is whitish to cream colored.
Brown rots of wood are brown, dry, and crumbly, with longitudinal and transverse cracks. These rots usually are in exposed wood and can cause extensive damage, resulting in structural failure. For Laetiporus sulphureus, the wood is initially yellowish to reddish brown. As the color deepens, the wood becomes softer. Eventually the wood becomes a brown crumbly mass, which on drying cracks into cubes of varying sizes. The cracks are filled with mycelial felts of the fungus. The fruiting bodies (conks) develop in large, over-lapping clusters, often containing 20 to 50 or more individual conks. The conks are shelf-like and may possess an indistinct stalk or be completely stalkless. When fresh, the conks are fleshy and the upper surface is bright orange-red, the pore-bearing, under surface being sulfur yellow. As the conks weather, they bleach to a dirty white and harden, becoming brittle and finally chalky in texture.
Brown stringy rot - Echinodontium tinctorium - the decay first appears as a slight golden-tan discoloration then conspicuous rust-red streaks appear followed by a softening of the wood and a separating of the annual rings. Finally the wood is reddish-brown to brown, fibrous, and stringy. As a result of complete disintegration of the decayed wood, the trunk becomes hollow and the tree is subject to wind throw. The perennial fruiting bodies (conks) are hard, woody, and hoof shaped. They are usually located at dead branch stubs. They may range up to a foot in diameter. The top is rough and cracked and dull black in color. The lower surface is gray white, and covered with hard, coarse, thickly set spines of uniform length. When broken open, the interior of the conk is a bright brick-red color. The presence of a single conk anywhere on the trunk of a tree indicates extensive decay.
Each of these wood decays leads to limb breakage and/or uprooted trees during wind or ice storms. Many trees have decreased vigor and dieback.


","

1) Help prevent wood decay by using cultural practices that promote tree growth and vigor while minimizing injuries that expose wood. For example, mowing equipment should not injure the roots, crown, or lower trunk.

2) Make pruning cuts adjacent to, but not into, the supporting branch, and prune when branches are small to enhance callus formation and wound healing.

3) Irrigation water, especially from sprinklers, should not wet the trunks.

4) Inspect trees for decay and/or conks to assess tree stability.

5) Remove affected trees to avoid damage to surrounding property or spread to other trees.

Hemp ,(Cannabis sativa)-Gray Mold and Stem Canker,"The fungus, Botrytis cinerea (teleomorph: Botryotinia fuckeliana), is an opportunistic pathogen that easily invades weak, damaged, or senescing tissue. This fungus is very common in the Pacific Northwest and occurs worldwide in greenhouses. Cannabis can be killed within one week. Spores (conidia) are produced throughout the growing season under a wide range of temperatures and humidity; and stem infections are a durable inoculum source, producing conidia throughout bloom. Cool temperatures (68°F is optimal but the fungus can grow between 50° and 80°F), high humidity, and free water on plant surfaces favor the disease, as do close plant spacing and irrigation practices that keep plants wet for a longer time. Durable sclerotia overwinter in soil.


","The pathogen causes brown, water-soaked spots on buds or chlorotic areas on stems.  Buds eventually rot producing a gray-brown mass of spores; infections start within buds. Botrytis cankers develop to the point of limb breakage or stem splitting, especially if plant canopies are dense and heavy. Small, black sclerotia can develop within stem tissues. Like the buds, cankers produce gray-brown masses of spores. Seedlings can also be killed.


","

1) Limit irrigation during and after bloom. Irrigate in the morning so plants do not stay wet more than 12 hours.

2) In greenhouses, maintain the relative humidity below 50%, temperatures warm, and high light intensity. Filtering out UV light  may prevent epidemics since sporulation requires UV light.

Holly ,(Ilex spp.)-Phytophthora Leaf and Twig Blight,"Phytophthora ilicis, a fungus-like microorganism. The disease develops in cool, rainy weather of fall and winter and subsides in warm, dry summer months. It may be very severe in dense orchards where air circulation is poor. In some orchards on the Oregon coast, the disease has caused almost complete defoliation and severe twig blighting, particularly on lower limbs.
The fungus-like microorganism produces oospores in leaf spots and the cortex of dead twigs. These spores allow the microorganism to survive from one season to the next. Pruning wounds and spine punctures, created by wind-whipped leaves, are ideal areas for new infections. Leaf scars can also be infected by zoospores or sporangia. Defoliation is related to the infected plant tissue's production of ethylene.
All cultivars of Ilex aquifolium appear to be susceptible. Many other species appear to be resistant to both infection and defoliation including I. cassine, I. ciliospinosa, I. cornuta, I. crenatas, I. glabra, I. intricata, I. latifolia, I. perado, I. sugeroki, I. vomitoria. Some interspecific hybrids had low amounts of infection and defoliation.


","The disease is characterized by purple-black leaf spotting, defoliation, and the development of twig cankers. Leaf spotting frequently begins on the leaf margin and on the lower part of the trees in late fall. The disease progresses up the tree during winter. Twigs die back, and cankers develop on larger stems later in winter. Infection may be at a berry cluster, and may girdle and kill the twig. Young plants in nursery beds also are affected and may be defoliated and killed.

Holly ,(Ilex spp.)-Red Leaf Spotting,"Several factors can lead to red spots on holly leaves including boron deficiency, ovipositing damage of certain insects, fungus-induced corky red spots (scab), spine injury, which results in holes or corky scratches, and copper-based pesticides. The amount of red color associated with spine injury (holes) depends on the variety.


","Copper spot-small, discrete purple spots with light centers on the leaves' undersides. On blue-stem cultivars such as French-English, spots on the leaf underside often produce purple blotches on the upper surface.

Honey Locust ,(Gleditsia spp.)-Canker,"Several fungi have been associated with a canker problem in the Pacific Northwest. Fusarium spp. and Phomopsis sp. have been associated with canker problems in nurseries. Nectria cinnabarina has been detected over the years from samples sent to the OSU Plant Clinic. Thyronectria austroamericana (asexual: Gyrostroma austroamericana) has not been reported in the Pacific Northwest but is very common in the Eastern United States.
Fusarium cankers have been associated with cold events in the fall, early harvest times and wounding. Sawdust storage seems to increase the potential for this disease problem as well. In addition, some cultivars (such as Imperial) are more susceptible than others.


","These fungi can cause cankers that are not easily distinguished from one another.
Fusarium canker-The earliest symptom is a subtle, orangish bark discoloration that is more sunken as the season progresses. Later, a definite, elongate, sunken, discolored canker is evident. Branches or trunks may be girdled, causing wilting, yellowing, and dieback above the canker. After the bark dies, fungal fruiting bodies (sporodochia) break through the lenticels. These sporodochia are football-shape (elliptical) and are yellow, orange, or salmon.
Nectria cinnabarina-Girdling cankers form on twigs, limbs, and sometimes trunks; then the affected parts die. Cankers appear as slightly sunken areas generally associated with wounds.
Pink-to-orange to reddish-brown fruiting structures (sporodochia) appear in the cankered area in early spring. Sporodochia gradually darken and may appear nearly black. Striking orange-to-red perithecia form on the stroma in late summer and early fall.


","

1) Prune off and destroy infected branches.

2) Water occasionally if drought becomes severe.

3) Avoid wounds. When limbing nursery trees, use sharp pruning shears instead of knocking off limbs by hand. Careful handling during harvest and storage are also encouraged.

4) Maintain tree vigor by proper fertilizing and watering.

5) Avoid leaving pruning stubs when removing top growth.

6) Avoid pruning in the dormant season.

7) Promote winter acclimation by harvesting at later times in the fall.

Honey Locust ,(Gleditsia spp.)-Powdery Mildew,"Erysiphe ravenelii (formerly Microsphaera ravenelii), a fungus endemic to North America. Succulent new growth late in the season is particularly susceptible. Conidia are released in response to abrupt decreases in relative humidity. Wind blows conidia to healthy foliage where they start new mildew colonies. Too much water, such as flowing water or rain, destroys spores by causing them to burst. The fungus does not grow in a leaf but rather across the surface. Small anchor cells of the fungus, haustoria, remain in the leaf and take nourishment from the plant, but the main filament and the multitudes of spores it produces are outside the leaf. The disease can develop under relatively dry conditions in spring and summer so long as the air is humid. Multiple disease cycles occur during the growing season.


","Leaves and sometimes young shoots are covered with a powdery, gray-white growth. This most often appears in summer and gradually increases throughout the rest of the season. Late in the season, the powdery growth may be dotted with tiny black fruiting bodies of the fungus. Affected leaves may be distorted or stunted, or may drop prematurely.

Current soil concentrations of heptachlor epoxide usually are lower than the sensitivity of the most accurate detection methods (less than 10 ppb), but some hop cultivars remain sensitive even at these low levels.


","The bine's central pith looks water soaked. Also, the bine epidermis looks rough and corky, particularly at the soil line and extending up the bine. The epidermis cracks and oozes plant sap. The crown may show extensive necrotic areas of blackened and rotted tissue, especially those portions over 1 year old. Bine growth is stunted and may be wilted, and affected yards show sparse bine growth and foliage.

These two fungi can survive in soil or plant debris. Field observations suggest that the onset of disease appears to be more severe in sites with more humid conditions during cone development, especially with overhead irrigation. Spores may come in contact with hop flowers during the burr stage but disease isn't evident until much later. Little information is available on the epidemiology of hop cone tip blight. The disease appears to be most severe on the cultivar Nugget but has also been a problem on the cultivars Chinook and Willamette.


","Affected cones turn from green to brown as they reach full maturity. Browning starts at the tip and moves up the cone toward the stem. Affected cone area varies; only the very tip may be brown, but all the bracts in the whorl tend to be affected. When the bracts are removed, necrosis of the portion of the strig associated with affected bracts is usually evident.

","In early spring, spike-like infected bines rise among normal shoots from the crown. Spikes are silvery or pale green, rigid, stunted, and brittle. The undersides of leaves may be covered by profuse sporulation by the pathogen and appear dark purple to black. Tips of normal branches may become infected and transformed into spikes. Leaves of all ages are attacked, resulting in brown angular spots. Flower clusters become infected, shrivel, turn brown, dry up, and may fall. Cones also are affected, becoming brown. Severe infection in some susceptible cultivars may produce a rot of the perennial crowns.

Hop ,(Humulus lupulus)-Fusarium Canker (Wilt),"The fungus, Fusarium sambucinum (teleomorph: Gibberella pulicaris), survives in soil and diseased plants and has been found in OR, WA, and ID. Confirmed by OSU in 'Chinook', 'Fuggles', 'Galena', 'Glacier', 'Mt. Hood', 'Nugget', 'Sterling', 'Willamette', and 'Zeus' varieties in the Pacific Northwest. The incidence of hop canker in the field is sporadic, not every bine on a hill is affected. Field observations have suggested that the onset of disease appears to be more severe under wet conditions, including growing seasons following flooding during wet winters. Hops grown in areas where the water table is high or where there is poor drainage had higher levels of canker. Higher rainfall may lead to increased soil moisture and in seasons where increased rainfall has occurred there have been more severe outbreaks of this disease. Fields with high levels of Hop stunt viroid also have been observed to have very high incidences of Fusarium canker and the presence of canker may lead to the discovery of the viroid disease in cultivars more tolerant of Hop stunt viroid infections.


","The affected bine wilts rapidly and suddenly; often at flowering or during hot weather. It is detached or can be detached readily from the crown with a gentle tug. The point of bine attachment to the crown usually is tapered or rounded off so that only a few central vascular elements connect the bine to the crown. Mechanical agitation (wind, tractors, sprayers, etc.) frequently break the connection; symptoms sometimes are attributed to ""tractor blight."" If the bine remains connected until late in the season, it possibly will collapse in hot weather. The bine's base may be swollen because carbohydrate movement has been inhibited; sometimes affected stems have a longitudinal split in the colonized cortical area of the bine. Vascular discoloration does not seem to be associated with the disease. Cankers can be found on rhizomes of affected plants. Wilted bines could potentially be confused with wilt caused by Verticillium species. The pattern of necrosis on leaves and vascular discoloration associated with Verticillium infection differentiates Verticillium wilt from canker.


","Specific control measures have not been researched; however, field observations indicate the following may help.

1) Avoid injury to hop plants.

2) Reduce crown wetness by hilling higher relative to rill irrigation ditches, by removing sucker growth that could shade the crown, and by reducing mulch.

3) Lime to increase soil pH above 7. Maintain the higher pH by using less ammonium-based nitrogen fertilizer; use nitrate-based fertilizer instead.

Hop ,(Humulus lupulus)-Powdery Mildew,"Powdery mildew is caused by a fungus, Podosphaera macularis (formerly Sphaerotheca humuli), which may persist either as bud infections or as chasmothecia (formerly cleistothecia, sexually produced overwintering structures). Bud infections are the only confirmed overwintering inoculum source in the Pacific Northwest. Although the fungus also is found on strawberry and caneberries, races that attack hop are limited to hop and are not known to infect any other plant species. Once a yard is infected with powdery mildew, the disease usually recurs the following season. Spore movement within the field is the greatest threat for disease spread, but some spread will occur between fields.


","In the spring time, new shoots can be covered with the powdery mildew fungus, and the entire shoot may appear white. These ""flagshoots"" produce conidia, which initiate secondary infections. Secondary infections on susceptible leaves appear as whitish, powdery spots on either the upper or lower leaf surface. Entire leaf surfaces can be covered with powdery mildew. Depending on the hop variety and leaf age, initially a small blister may form before the fungus is visible. The fungus becomes visible as conidia (spores) are produced, around 5 to 10 days after infection.
Younger leaves are most susceptible; as the leaf matures, it is more difficult for infection to occur. Studies have shown that on actively growing shoots, the most susceptible tissues are about five leaves back from the tip. Powdery mildew grows over a wide range of temperatures, at least 54°F to 85°F. Colonies can tolerate temperatures more extreme, especially during high humidity, resuming growth and sporulation when conditions moderate. The exact environmental conditions are not well characterized.
Flowers and cones of susceptible varieties may be infected. If a variety is susceptible, cones appear susceptible to infection throughout most of their development. Generally, growth stops in the infected area. Infected cones are stunted, malformed, and mature rapidly, leading to cone shatter and uneven crop maturity. Infections at the burr stage can lead to flower abortion. Powdery mildew usually is visible on infected cones but sometimes can be found under overlapping bracts. Infected areas on cones become red to blackish if chasmothecia are produced. Chasmothecia on hops in the Pacific Northwest have not been confirmed.


","These management strategies aim to reduce overwintering and buildup of early-season disease inoculum. Idle yards should not go untreated! Spores can move between fields, so management timing is important.

","Thorough spray coverage is essential to protect hop plants; spray every row. Apply protective fungicides before disease is reproducing and spreading. Chemical and cultural controls can help to keep disease levels low, both in terms of disease incidence and severity as well as vertical position within the canopy.
Discuss your chemical options with your hop buyer; applications during cone development may have some restrictions.

"
Hop ,(Humulus lupulus)-Red Crown Rot,"A fungus, Phacidiopycnis sp., that can survive in plant debris, on hop plants, or in soil as sclerotia. The fungus needs injured hop tissue for infection to occur. This disease was first reported in Australia in 1981 and recently confirmed in a hop yard in the Pacific Northwest. It usually takes more than one growing season to notice the problem, and cone yield and alpha-acids can be affected.


","Plants appear weak and yellowish. Rhizomes and roots have a twisted growth. The bark covering these affected root systems thickens, becomes loose, and brownish in color. Internal tissues turn dry and turn orange to red, crumbling easily. There is a well-defined lesion margin, and it may appear water-soaked with a pinkish coloration in the adjacent healthy tissue.


","

1) Propagate from cuttings free of the fungus.

2) Avoid mechanical crowning.

",,
Hop ,(Humulus lupulus)-Verticillium Wilt,"Two fungi, Verticillium nonalfalfae (formerly V. albo-atrum) and V. dahliae, that survive in soil and diseased plants and infect through plant rootlets. The virulent form of wilt (incited by V. nonalfalfae) that occurs in Europe has not been found in the United States. 'Fuggle', 'Cascade', 'Willamette', and 'Columbia' sometimes get a milder form of the disease. 'Bullion' and 'Brewers Gold' are resistant to the mild form. The mild form infects many common weeds, so weed control is important. Some hop plantings have ""wilt spots."" Do not put bines and harvest debris from these spots back on agricultural land as Verticillium can persist in hop residue.


","Leaves yellow and die from the base up. Dying leaves usually show a tiger-stripe effect because bands of dark necrotic tissue alternate with yellow. Bines cut near the base of the hill usually show a light brown discoloration of woody tissue under the bark. Heavily infected plants die on the string, usually just before or at harvest. Fields infected with the mild form decline over a number of years while the virulent form will kill a plant in a couple of years or less.

1) Plant resistant cultivars.

2) Practice good weed control.

3) Avoid excessive irrigation during the spring.

4) Apply sufficient nitrogen for crop needs, but avoid excessive fertilization of this nutrient.

",,
Hop ,(Humulus lupulus)-Viroid Diseases,"Hop latent viroid (HpLVd) and Hop stunt viroid (HpSVd) have been confirmed in the Pacific Northwest. HpLVd is ubiquitous in hop yards in the Pacific Northwest and worldwide, but only produces known symptoms on a few varieties, such as 'Omega'. It is not known to cause yield loss in varieties grown in the Pacific Northwest. HpSVd was recently confirmed in Pacific Northwest on a wide range varieties, including 'Glacier', 'Mt. Hood', 'Nugget', 'Sterling' and 'Willamette' in both Oregon and Washington. Little is known about this disease, but it is reportedly spread |mechanically during propagation, field operations, and to a limited degree by plant-to-plant contact.


","HpLVd-infected plants have no known symptoms on varieties grown in the Pacific Northwest. Symptoms of HpLVd on cultivar Omega appear as a yellowing and curling of leaves. Necrosis of leaves and leaf margins is common. Infected plants are stunted, have shortened internodes, and in general have an unthrifty appearance. Yield losses can be significant.
The symptomology of HpSVd is not well known for most hop varieties grown in the Pacific Northwest. In some varieties such as 'Glacier', HSVd causes a stunting of plants, yellowing, and curling of the upper leaves. On other varieties there may be a yellow speckling of leaves, and sidearm stunting or dieback. Plant height may be reduced by 40% as compared to noninfected plants. The severity of symptoms may become progressively greater with time. On susceptible varieties, the number of cones produced and cone size are reduced by as much as 50% to 75%. The alpha-acid content of cones that are produced is one-half to one-third of that in cones from healthy plants.
Plantings with high levels of Hop stunt also have been observed to have very high incidences of Fusarium canker and the presence of canker may lead to the discovery of the viroid disease in hop cultivars more tolerant of Hop stunt viroid infection.


","Exclusion is an important means of viroid control.

1) Use viroid-tested stock certified to be free of viroids.

2) Clean rootstock is available from the Clean Plant Network at

3) Plant where hops have not been grown before or in fields where all hop plants have died out.

4) General sanitation for disease control.

4.1) Work/harvest diseased yards last.
4.2) Clean equipment between yards, particularly during early season operations. Currently, it is recommended that equipment be cleaned by first washing to remove plant debris and then with a 5% to 10% bleach solution for at least a few seconds to upwards of 10 minutes. The longer time the equipment can be in contact with the disinfecting solution, the greater the likelihood that the equipment will be sanitized. Because the bleach is so caustic to metals, it may be good idea to rinse equipment with clean water after sanitizing.
5) Destroy plants that are severely stunted or yellowed. It is recommended that you wait at least one season after infected plants are removed before replanting to hop to ensure that all of the infected hop plants have been eliminated. When replanting, it will be important to plant with stock that has been tested for  and shown to be free of the viroid.

Hop ,(Humulus lupulus)-Virus Diseases,"Hop latent virus (HpLV), American hop latent virus (AHLV), Hop mosaic virus (HpMV), and Apple mosaic virus (ApMV) been found in Pacific Northwest hop yards. The first two produce no symptoms and no known crop loss. HpMV, a carlavirus, has not been a problem traditionally even when detected in a planting. Many cultivars are tolerant to HpMV and are asymptomatic when infected; a few like Chinook and Golding can be very sensitive. ApMV, an ilarvirus previously known in hop as Prunus necrotic ringspot virus, can cause up to 30% loss in cone production and also decrease alpha acid levels, but ApMV effects are cultivar dependent. HpLV, AHLV, and HpMV are transmitted by plant-to-plant contact and by the Damson-hop aphid (Phorodon humuli); HpMV also transmitted by the green-peach aphid, Myzus persicae. ApMV moves by plant-to-plant contact.


","HpLV- and AHLV-infected plants have no known symptoms on varieties grown in the Pacific Northwest.
HpMV-sensitive hops show a chlorotic, pale vein-banding on the leaf, which is mottled and curls down strongly. Diseased hills may survive several years but are stunted with shortened internodes and can be killed by the infection.
ApMV-symptoms depend on hop variety and virus strain, and especially rapid changes in weather. Symptoms usually are suppressed in hot weather and appear during cool weather. Consequently, symptoms may occur in leaves of a certain age but not in younger or older leaves. This is true of other plant parts as well. Foliar symptoms include chlorotic or necrotic arcs and rings or necrotic line patterns. Leaves often have a crisp and leathery texture as well and there may be curling of the leaf margins. Plants usually are stunted with shortened internodes and sidearms and may have difficulty climbing. If cool weather occurs during flowering, cone set and size may be drastically reduced.

Horse-chestnut ,(Aesculus spp.)-Leaf Blotch,"The fungus Phyllosticta sphaeropsoidea  (sexual Guignardia aesculi) overwinters in fallen leaves. Ascospores are produced in the spring and infect new leaves from budbreak through shoot elongation. The disease is favored by wet weather in spring. Although not formally reported from the Pacific Northwest, it has been detected on a few plant samples at the OSU Plant Clinic. It is an economic problem for nursery tree production. Established landscape trees may be infected each year without serious injury or decline.
Most species and subspecies are susceptible; however, the following were resistant: A. arguta, A. glabra var. monticola and sargentii, A. parviflora and A. parviflora var. serotina.


","The first symptoms are discolored, water-soaked spots on the leaf. Later, the irregularly shaped spots turn reddish brown with very bright-yellow margins. Spots may remain small or may enlarge to cover the entire leaf. When the whole leaf is infected, it may cup up and become dry and brittle and fall from the tree or seedling. Small black fruiting bodies (pycnidia) of the asexual form can be seen in the center of the spots. Petioles also may be attacked. Complete defoliation is uncommon for large established trees but common in the nursery if not controlled.

Horseradish ,(Armoracia rusticana)-White Rust,"Albugo candida, a fungus-like microorganism, can cause disease on all crucifers, as well as spinach and horseradish. The fungus overwinters as oospores in plant debris or as mycelium in perennial plants. The oospores can germinate and infect young plants, leading to pustules on the plant. Sporangia are produced in pustules, can be moved by wind, rain, or insects, and can germinate, giving rise to zoospores. Zoospores are motile; they swim for a short distance and then invade the plant by germinating through the stomata. Sporangia require some drying in order to germinate well but disease development is favored by moist conditions and temperatures between 50°F and 77°F. Dew, fog, or periods of extended rainfall and cool temperatures are ideal for zoospore activity.


","The fungus may attack any part of the plant: stem, leaves, or flowers. Systemic infections enlarge and distort infected parts. Infected flower parts often lose normal pigmentation and produce chlorophyll. The raised, white, spore-containing pustules, isolated or grouped together to form large patches, are the diagnostic symptom. Pustules have a powdery consistency and are produced on leaves or stems.

HVX is transmitted by physical or mechanical means where wounded, infected plants are touched followed by touching and wounding healthy plants. Lawnmower injury was given as an example in the original description. It can also be transmitted by vegetative propagation and by seed. Unlike the other viruses, the host range is limited primarily to Hosta spp. Although several cultivars are susceptible there are also several that become infected but show no symptoms. These later cultivars can still spread the virus. Infections of the cultivars Nightlife, Olive Bailey Langdon, and H. sieboldiana cultivars Elegans and Northern Exposure do not go systemic and may be useful to grow.

Hydrangea,"Nematode, Foliar",,,,,
Hydrangea,Powdery Mildew,"Erysiphe friesii var. friesii (formerly Microsphaera friesii) has been reported from Washington and Erysiphe polygoni has been reported from British Columbia. These fungi are favored by conditions that produce high humidity but dry leaves such as heavily-shaded growing sites. It is a highly specialized pathogen that forms a close association with the host. Conditions that favor the host also favor the pathogen. Much of the fungus remains outside infected plant parts where it grows on the surface but sinks root-like structures called haustoria into plant cells to obtain nutrients. The white growth seen is composed of both mycelium and spores of the fungus.
The cultivar Veitchii was found to be resistant, Nikko Blue was susceptible, and Madame Emile Mouilliere, Forever Pink, Lilacina, and Holstein were intermediate; while Preziosa is very susceptible.


","Leaves' undersides are covered with a white powdery growth; upper surfaces develop yellowish green blotches or turn purplish brown. Leaves may become completely covered and die early. Premature defoliation may occur on severely infected plants. Reduced leaf area and shoot elongation are also possible. Blooms may become stunted and malformed.

Hydrangea,Ringspots,"There are 14 viruses reported for hydrangea. Hydrangea ringspot virus (HRSV) can be transmitted mechanically by leaf contact or by knives but not through seed or by aphids. Suspected as cause of hydrangea running-out. Many cultivars are tolerant of the virus.
Hydrangea chlorotic mottle virus (HdCMV) can be transmitted mechanically or by the green peach aphid (Myzus persicae) but only infects H. macrophylla.
Tomato ringspot virus (ToRSV) and Tobacco ringspot virus (TRSV) are primarily vectored by nematodes. Cherry leaf roll virus has also been reported on hydrangea. Tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV) has also been recovered from hydrangea and is vectored by the western flower thrips.


","HRSV - Leaves may show chlorotic to brown leaf spots or rings. Leaves become crinkled, rolled, and asymmetric. The number of florets per inflorescence also is lower in infected plants. Severe stunting and running-out also may occur.
HdCMV - Leaf mottling, blistering, and reddening and chlorotic ring spots were among the various symptoms found. Symptoms in the cultivar Endless Summer were more frequent during the spring but less so during the summer.
TRSV - stunting, some leaf distortion and leaf chlorosis with green blotches on leaves. Flower virescence (turning green) can also occur.
TSWV - Ringspots are common but indistinguishable from those caused by HdRSV.


","

1) Soak knives in trisodium phosphate or other disinfestants often when taking cuttings. Use two knives so a worker can cut with one while the other soaks. When done with a batch, cultivar, etc. switch one knife for the other and allow the used one to soak.

2) Buy clean stock, or isolate new stock from main plantings.

3) Avoid nematode-vectored viruses by planting clean stock in containers in soilless media.

4) Control weeds that may be reservoirs of virus and insect vectors.

Hydrangea,Root Rot,"The OSU Plant Clinic has found several oomycetes associated with root rots of hydrangea including Phytophthora spp. and Pythium spp. These diseases are generally found where plants are in cold wet soils and/or overwatered. Poorly draining potting media can also favor these diseases.


","Samples with oomycetes have displayed root rots, root crown and stem rots, and shoot diebacks. Leaves may turn chlorotic before wilting, becoming necrotic and may not fall from dead plants. A reddish-brown discoloration can be found in the roots or root crown of plants. There may be a line between discolored and healthy tissue.


","

1) Do not overwater plants.

2) Provide good drainage for plants in beds, fields, or containers. Place containers on gravel beds (4 inches or more deep) to allow drainage. Do not place containers on poly sheets; they can prevent containers from draining into soil and allow contaminated drainage water to spread from the base of one container to another.

3) Avoid reusing pots from a previous crop for propagation. If pots must be reused then wash off all debris and soak in a sanitizing solution or treat with aerated steam for 30 min.

","Use when new root growth is expected. The Group 4 and Group 33 fungicides have been useful for these diseases on other crops but none specifically list hydrangea on the label. They can be legal used but test them on a few plants before widespread use.

Hypericum ,(St. Johnswort)-Rust,"Two autoecious rust fungi, Melampsora hypericorum and Uromyces hypericifrondosi (formerly Uromyces triquetrus) (which may also be called U. hyperici) . The latter has been reported from Oregon and has been found twice by the OSU Plant Clinic in the early 90's. Rusts on this plant do not need an alternate host to complete their lifecycle.


","Yellow, red, or brown spots on leaf surfaces. In spring and early summer, powdery orange spores are produced from fruiting bodies on the lower leaf surface. Later, in fall and early winter, tissue on the lower leaf surface becomes necrotic where infected, though orange sporulation may still be observed.


","Has been very hard to control in the Pacific Northwest.

1) Remove infected leaves and leaf litter in the planting site. This may require mowing severely infected plantings, raking all leaves, and destroying infected leaf litter.

2) Avoid overhead irrigation or apply such that plants are not wet for extended periods of time.

3) Plant resistant cultivars.

","Prevention is the best approach. Short of that, use wetting agents with fungicides.

Impatiens ,(Impatiens walleriana)-Downy Mildew,"Plasmopara obducens is a host-specific, fungus-like organism known as an oomycete, or water mold. There have been sporadic reports in greenhouses since 2004, but it was not until summer 2011 that regional outbreaks of this disease were seen for the first time in landscape beds and container plantings in North America. The disease was found in landscapes in Oregon and Washington since 2012. Impatiens business dropped 50% to 60% due to this disease alone.
Oospores survive in plant debris and are released into the soil or media as infected stems decay. These resting spores can survive in the soil for years. Oospores produce sporangia, which are then splashed by rain or carried by wind to new plants. These airborne spores may find their way into greenhouses as well as landscapes. Infected plugs brought into the greenhouse can also be a source of this pathogen. Young plants and immature plant tissues are especially susceptible to infection. Once on the plant, sporangia may germinate directly or release swimming zoospores. Zoospores can swim in moisture on the leaf surface, encyst, then germinate and penetrate the leaf tissue through the stomata by means of a germ tube. The time from infection to the appearance of new sporangia varies from 5 to 14 days depending on the age of plant tissue, temperature, and humidity. In response to changes in light, temperature, and/or humidity, the new sporangia are dislodged and can easily become airborne or splashed by rain or water to other leaves and distant plants. Complete plant loss can occur in as little as 4 to 6 weeks. There is no evidence of seedborne transmission. The disease is generally found late summer to early fall.
All cultivars and intraspecific hybrids of I. walleriana are susceptible to impatiens downy mildew. A few species of wild impatiens are also hosts of this disease, but there are no other known hosts. New Guinea impatiens (Impatiens hawkerii) are highly tolerant and have been successfully grown in greenhouses and landscapes even under high disease pressure.


","A light-green yellowing or stippling of infected leaves develops first. Very subtle gray lines or markings are sometimes observed on the top of the leaf. Infected leaves may curl downward at the edges, but generally this is a more advanced symptom of infection. Leaf symptoms are often first observed on the younger leaves or terminal growth. Seedling cotyledons are also highly susceptible. Plants infected at an early stage of development may be stunted in both height and leaf size, yet may show no visible signs of sporulation.
A white, downy-like growth (sporangia) may be visible on the underside of infected leaves during cool and moist or humid conditions. Eventually leaves and flowers will drop, resulting in bare stems with only a few tiny, yellow leaves remaining. This symptom is more likely to be observed in a landscape setting and may be blamed on deer or rabbit damage. The remaining green stems then collapse.


","Aggressive scouting, environmental controls, and good sanitation will help manage this disease in the greenhouse.

1) Avoid the introduction of diseased plant material. Inspect liners and plugs on delivery. Segregate any newly arriving material to observe for symptoms.

2) Grow vegetative cuttings and seed-grown plants in separate greenhouses to limit cross-contamination.

3) Reduce greenhouse humidity and limit leaf moisture, especially at night, to limit secondary spread.

4) Provide good air movement through plant spacing and horizontal airflow.

5) Irrigate when leaves will dry most quickly to help minimize leaf wetness and humidity.

6) Promptly bag and seal symptomatic plants and any fallen leaves or petals before carrying them out of the greenhouse. Before planting in the landscape, and at the end of every season, remove as much plant debris as possible including leaves, stems, and roots.

7) Rotate landscape planting beds each year so that impatiens are not grown in the same place for 3 or 4 years.

8) Consider New Guinea impatiens, begonias, coleus, or other alternative bedding plants where impatiens were grown the previous year.

","Must use fungicides in conjunction with cultural controls and before the disease is found. Apply fungicides preventively on a 7- to 14-day interval (depending on material) for maximum efficacy. Scouting first then spraying is an ineffective tactic. Downy mildew resistant to several active ingredients have been found in various locations.

Impatiens,Botrytis Blight,"The fungus Botrytis cinerea, which colonizes dead, dying, and wounded plant parts. From these infections they can attack healthy impatiens tissues. Flower petals, of most any crop, are susceptible at any stage of development and can fall onto leaves starting new infections. A moist, humid environment is ideal for the pathogen's sporulation and spread. Conidia may come from many sources in and outside the greenhouse. It is found everywhere plants are grown and has a wide host range.


","Flowers develop necrotic spots, which in humid conditions, becomes fuzzy with brown to gray fungal growth. Leaves develop large, irregular tan to brown areas. Stems may rot if infected.


","

1) Remove all dead and dying plant parts (particularly blossoms) on and around plants.

2) Maintain a relatively dry greenhouse environment (humidity below 90%) by increasing spacing between plants for good air circulation and taking care not to splash water on foliage during watering. Heating the greenhouse at night or venting around sunset may be necessary.

3) Spacing plants also allows better light penetration, reducing lower leaf senescence and thus helping reduce the amount of highly susceptible plant tissue.

4) Place fans in greenhouse to get better air circulation.

Impatiens-Crown Rot ,(Damping-off),"Several organisms. Pythium sp. has been reported from Washington as causing damping-off. The OSU Plant Clinic has found both Pythium sp. and Rhizoctonia sp. Pythium is favored by cool, wet soils, Rhizoctonia by warm soils. Rhizoctonia grows across the soil/media surface to attack the base of stems or leaves in contact with the ground. Both Pythium and Rhizoctonia are soilborne pathogens that can survive in infected plant debris in soil or in used pots and flats. The New Guinea impatiens cultivars Aurora, Cosmos, and Twilight are susceptible to both fungi.


","Wilting, rotted roots, and death are common for either disease. Pythium infections are black and moist and may extend into the basal stem. Blackening of the stem in cross section may also occur. Rhizoctonia-infected tissue is drier, brown, and cracked. A web-like growth may be seen on infected plant parts. Leaves touching the ground may be infected first.


","

1) Use sterile, pathogen-free potting mix or soil. Also disinfect any tools and equipment that might be used and contaminate the media.

2) Growing media pH should be between 5.6 to 6.4 (except 6.2 to 6.5 for New Guinea impatiens) and temperatures at 73°F. Check regularly to ensure low electrolyte concentration levels.

3) Use new or thoroughly cleaned and disinfected pots and flats or treat with aerated steam for 30 min.

4) Purchase new seed each year, as it will not last over a year even with good seed storage.

5) Do not overwater or let the watering hose touch the ground below greenhouse benches.

Impatiens,Impatiens Necrotic Spot,"Impatiens necrotic spot virus (INSV), formerly the I strain of the Tomato Spotted Wilt Virus (TSWV-L). The INSV has been reported on many floral crops. Unlike TSWV, which has many thrips vector species, INSV is reported to be vectored only by the western flower thrips, Franklinella occidentalis. Double-flower impatiens are highly attractive to the thrips vector and often show dramatic symptoms of INSV infection. TSWV infection is less common, and symptoms are similar. Both viruses can infect impatiens.


","Symptoms of INSV on New Guinea impatiens include stunting, brown or purple leaf spots, ringspots on petals, black diffuse spotting on leaves, black stem sections, leaf stunting, distortion, and chlorotic mottling. Multiple necrotic spots may be seen rather than a single spot (which is more typical of a fungal infection). Leaf blights may start at the base of the leaf and become  blackened. Plants may wilt and collapse. Variation is extreme from cultivar to cultivar, and many cultivars are symptomless. Symptoms may appear in winter and be masked in summer. Symptoms caused by TSWV are indistinguishable.
Symptoms of INSV on single- and double-flowered I. wallerana include yellow mosaic, scattered small black or brown spots or flecks, brown or black ringspots often preceding leaf yellowing and abscission, black stem sections, and stunting of the leaf and plant.


","

1) Have suspected diseased plants tested for virus.

2) If the virus is present, destroy all infected plants and remove them and their potting soil (which contains the thrips' pupae) from the greenhouse range.

3) Use light blue or yellow sticky traps to monitor thrips. Place one (1) sticky trap per 500 to 1000 sq ft just above plants. Check traps weekly and keep accurate records of when and where thrips are trapped.

4) Remove weeds under benches. Bittercress, for example, is attractive to thrips and is a symptomless carrier of the virus.

5) Place indicator plants in each house where thrips may land. A number of petunia cultivars including Calypso, Summer Madness, and Super Blue Magic are good INSV and TSWV indicators. The fava bean 'Toto' also can be used.

6) Separate greenhouse ranges with plastic barriers. Screen or net air intake vents. Use double-entry door construction.

7) Workers should avoid wearing light-color clothing such as yellow, blue, and white.

","Sticky traps and spot treatments are part of an integrated control monitoring program. Consult the PNW Insect Management Handbook for currently effective materials.

Indian Hawthorn ,(Rhaphiolepis indica)-Leaf Spot,"The fungus Diplocarpon mespili (asexual: Entomosporium mespili), is most active during prolonged periods of cool, wet weather in the spring. Fungal spores overwinter on infected leaves or juvenile shoots. High humidity, cool weather, crowded plants, and splashing water from rain or overhead irrigation provide an ideal environment for disease spread. Host range is wide including Indian Hawthorn, photinia and quince.


","Leaf lesions arise as minute dots on newly developing leaves in spring. Lesions enlarge to form gray-brown, irregularly shaped spots with a red or brown border. Leaf spots mature as circular, brown lesions, 0.25 inch in diameter, with raised black fruiting bodies (acervuli) in the center of each spot. Leaf lesions can be few and scattered or can become so numerous that they coalesce to form large dead areas. Defoliation can be heavy with the onset of severe outbreaks of the disease. Infected areas on older leaves frequently have a gray-white cast due to the production of spore masses when leaves are wet. Infection of older leaves in late spring may also appear as white ""ghost spots"" on leaves when higher temperatures abort the progress of infection.


","Careful inspection of container-grown plants in early spring helps identify early signs of leaf spot.

1) Avoid overhead irrigation or apply such that plants are not wet for extended periods of time.

2) Spacing of container plants helps prevent spread of disease to healthy plants.

Population levels are highest in the top 8 inches of soil. Spores infect roots and cross the basal plate. These infections may continue to enter and spread within the vascular tissues. The fungus is spread widely by contaminated soil and infected corms while local spread can be by water flow and rain splash. Excess nitrogen fertility may favor the disease. There may be several types or strains of the fungus because isolates from gladiolus may infect iris, but isolates from iris may or may not infect gladiolus.","Lower leaves may be stunted or yellowed or may fail to emerge. Roots may be invaded and eventually rot as decay progresses into the bulb. The bulb's infected basal plate becomes shrunken, turning light brown or reddish brown.

Jerusalem Artichoke ,(Helianthus tuberosus)-Southern Blight,"The fungus, Athelia rolfsii (syn. Sclerotium rolfsii). This fungus has a very wide host range and has recently appeared in vegetable crops in western Oregon. Tomato, peppers, eggplant, potato, soybean, grasses including corn and wheat, alfalfa, clover, asparagus, beet, Brassica crops (broccoli, cabbage, kale, etc.), beans, carrot, cucumber, melons, pumpkin, squash, sweet potato, lettuce, chicories, garlic, onion, rhubarb, cuttings of woody tree fruit including apple, and a wide-range of herbaceous and woody ornamentals are among the many plant types susceptible to southern blight. Small, round survival structures of the fungus, called sclerotia, allow the fungus to persist for years in soil. Warm (> 59°F, 81°F to 86°F is optimum), wet, acidic soils are conducive for disease outbreaks.


","Plant stems turn brown, starting at or below the soil line and decay moves upwards. Leaves turn brown and plants eventually die stem by stem, typically over several weeks to a couple of months. A white moldy growth usually develops on the base of infected stems and may appear on the soil surface immediately surrounding infected plants. Small, reddish-brown to light-brown, mustard seed-like structures commonly form on this white moldy growth, especially along the base of infected stems, and can be seen on plant portions below the soil line. Neighboring plants become infected as the fungus grows plant-to-plant.


","

1) Remove infected plants and surrounding soil, taking care to include all the small, reddish-brown sclerotia, and destroy.

2) Inspect vegetative cuttings or plants of susceptible hosts imported from California or the Southeastern US for signs of infection.

3) Lime acidic soils.

4) Winter or spring crop contaminated soils to avoid exposing plants to warm soil temperatures that promote disease.

Juniper ,(Juniperus spp.)-Magnesium Deficiency,"'Tam' (Juniper sabina 'Tamariscifola')  and 'Pfitzer's' (Juniper chinensis 'Pfitzeriana')  juniper often are deficient in magnesium, and other cultivars may be as well. Competition with calcium-rich growing medium or acid conditions can also produce magnesium deficiency when it is not limiting.


","In contrast to the twig blight caused by the fungus Phomopsis, which is confined at the outset to one shoot or to one side of the plant and usually kills one shoot at a time, magnesium deficiency seldom kills the plant. It produces chlorotic and/or dead foliage in the center of severely affected plants.


","Be careful because some junipers, such as J. horizontalis, prefer a pot pH of around 5.5.

1) Apply Epsom salts (magnesium sulfate) to soil at 1 cup/100 sq ft.

2) Foliar application of Epsom salts at 5 oz/gal water (40 g/l).

Juniper ,(Juniperus spp.)-Mistletoe (a True Mistletoe),"Phoradendron juniperinum and P. densum. A parasitic seed plant, mistletoe depends on its host for much of its water and mineral nutrients. Fruit can be toxic to humans and livestock, but birds eat and disperse them to new trees. P. juniperinum belongs to the same genus as the mistletoe that affects oak but will not grow on oak or other conifers. The species on juniper are principally leafless. Found in central and southern Oregon on western juniper.
A population of Juniperus monosperma was more successful at dispersing when infected with P. juniperinum. Birds like berries from both plants and juniper seeds germinate better after being digested. But while juniper is erratic in fruit production, the mistletoe is consistent. The mistletoe, which helps maintain bird populations, thereby helps disperse both plants.


","Mature stems are woody with smooth surfaces. Leaves are scale-like and about 1 mm long. Flowers are produced from July to September. The male inflorescence has one or two segments, each with five to nine flowers. The female inflorescence has one segment with two flowers. Fruit is pinkish white, smooth, and about 4 mm in diameter.

Juniper ,(Juniperus spp.)-Pear Trellis Rust,"Gymnosporangium sabinae (formerly G. fuscum), a fungus closely related to a number of other rusts that alternate between conifer and Rosaceous hosts. Most popular ornamental junipers are susceptible such as J. chinensis, J. sabina, J. scopulorum and J. virginianna. The species J. communis, J. horizontalis, and J. squamata are immune or highly resistant. This disease is well established in western Washington, coastal British Columbia and in Contra Costa County, CA. Found in western Oregon on pear in 2016.
Telia are extruded from galls during wet weather in early spring. Basidospores are dispersed at night to rosaceous hosts causing an annual infection. Aecia form on the underside of leaves on rosaceous hosts such as pear, in the fall. Aeciospores are dispersed to junipers causing a perennial infection.


","There are no obvious symptoms on juniper. Careful examination of infected plants reveals elongated, swollen galls on older wood. Needles may be shed from this swollen area and small or thin twigs may die if infected. Red to orange, jelly-like telia are extruded from the galls during wet weather in early spring.

Juniper ,(Juniperus spp.)-Phytophthora Root Rot,"Phytophthora cinnamomi, a soilborne fungus-like microorganism that has been reported from Oregon. Other species have been reported from several other states. The disease is favored by wet or waterlogged conditions during warm weather. The fungus-like microorganism can produce swimming spores that are attracted to roots and can move from one infected tree to another in saturated soil or between flooded pots in a nursery. Inoculum also may be found in containers previously used to grow other crops. Many cultivars are susceptible; however, some may show similar symptoms simply from waterlogging and not necessarily from infection.


","Plants are stunted with blue-gray foliage. This symptom intensifies as heat and water stress begin in early summer. Foliage eventually turns brown as the plant dies. Single branches may die first, which makes the disease look as if it is on only one side of the plant. Root and root crown tissues are extensively decayed or necrotic. Sometimes, necrotic root crown tissue extends several inches above the soil line. Some cultivars show an ""off"" color in the winter months but ""green up"" when growth resumes in spring; however, plants affected by root rot do not ""green up"" in spring.


","

1) Improve drainage where junipers are grown.

2) Isolate new shipments from main growing area and observe them for signs of disease.

3) Use only new pots to propagate plants. If pots must be reused then wash off all debris and soak in a sanitizing solution or treat with aerated steam for 30 min.

4) Remove and destroy infected plants.

Juniper ,(Juniperus spp.)-Rust,"Several fungi in the genus Gymnosporangium cause rusts on juniper and members of the rose family such as serviceberry and pear. Seven different species are reported from Oregon, nine from Washington, and six from Idaho. Gymnosporangium bethelii, G. harknessianum, G. kernianum, and G. nelsonii have been reported on J. occidentalis (California juniper) in Oregon. Spore stages produced on junipers infect only members of the rose family in early spring over a 2- to 3-year period. The spore stages produced on serviceberry, pear, or others in the rose family only infect junipers during the course of one summer.
Cedar apple rust is common east of the Rockies on J. virginiana. In the West, it is rare on J. virginiana and J. scopulorum. Galls on juniper in the West are more likely due to other species of rust.


","G. nelsonii (and G. bethelii) may produce woody, round, to elongate, galls on juniper branches and small stems. Dark brown, tongue-shaped structures (telia) emerge from these galls or just the juniper branches after a rain in the spring. G. kernianum will produce large witches' brooms in junipers. G. harknessianum produces reddish-brown, gelatinous masses on juniper leaves.

Juniper ,(Juniperus spp.)-Seiridium Canker,,,,,
Juniper ,(Juniperus spp.)-Twig Blight,"The fungus Diaporthe juniperivora (formerly Phomopsis juniperovora) is found most often in western Oregon. Kabatina juniperi also causes a tip blight but is rare in western Oregon. Kabatina tip blight is more common in eastern Washington and throughout nursery markets east of the Rocky Mountains. Cultivars differ in susceptibility to both fungi. J. chinensis 'Pfitzeriana Aurea' is considered resistant to both. Mostly a nursery problem and not present in the landscape as much.
Time and location of infection also differ. Diaporthe infection occurs whenever foliage is young and moisture and humidity are high-generally, spring. Older, mature foliage is resistant to infection. Excessive pruning or shearing in summer will stimulate new, succulent growth that is highly susceptible. Kabatina infection is thought to occur in fall and often is associated with wounds, insect feeding, or mechanical damage.


","Both fungi cause a foliar blight and tip dieback, which are difficult to separate. Diaporthe-affected foliage first turns dull red or brown and finally ash-gray. Small gray lesions often girdle branch tips and kill the foliage beyond the diseased tissue. Small, black, fruiting bodies (pycnidia) develop in lesions. Most blighting is on the terminal 4 to 6 inches of branches. Repeated blighting in early summer can result in abnormal bunching of shoots, which may resemble a witches' broom. Young trees or shrubs may be stunted with discolored foliage and may eventually die.
Symptoms of Kabatina infection generally are before those of Diaporthe. The ends of branches turn dull green then red or yellow. Small ash-gray to silver lesions dotted with small, black, fruiting bodies are visible at the base of the discolored tissue. Generally, this fungus does not result in extensive branch dieback or tree death, which could indicate a root problem.

Kale ,(Brassica oleracea var. acephala)-Black Leg (Phoma Stem Canker),"Leptosphaeria maculans (syn. Plenodomus lingam, anamorph: Phoma lingam) is a fungus that can infect a range of cruciferous crops. Host plants include Brassica crops (broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cabbage, collards, canola, mizuna, mustard greens, rutabaga, turnip, etc.), Sinapis (white and yellow mustard), and Raphanus (daikon and radish). Cruciferous weeds common in the Pacific Northwest can be host to black leg, including: birdsrape mustard (Brassica rapa), black mustard (B. nigra), western yellow cress or curvepod yellowcress (Rorippa curvisiliqua), tansymustard (Descurainia pinnata), hedge mustard (Sisymbrium officinale), tumble mustard (S. altissimum), small tumbleweed mustard (S. loeselii), pennycress (Thlaspi arvense), mouseear cress (Arabidopsis thaliana), annual wallrocket (Diplotaxis muralis), perennial wallrocket (D. tenuifolia), and wild radish (Raphanus raphanistrum). The fungus survives on living plants as pycnidia, which produce water-splashed pycnidiospores, or with plant debris as pycnidia and/or pseudothecia. Pseudothecia release ascospores that may be windborne long distances, at least several miles and perhaps further on storm fronts. The fungus survives in association with infected plant residues until the plant debris decomposes, which can take up to four years. In fall-sown crops or on winter weeds, pseudothecia can form on dead parts of infected plants prior to plant death and pseudothecia continue to be formed in any infected residues that remain on the soil surface. In spring-sown crops, pseudothecia do not form on dead portions until after harvest, and their production on residues atop the soil typically starts the following fall after a couple of wet periods. Ascospores are released from the pseudothecia following wet or humid conditions and when mean temperatures are between 46°F and 59°F. Conditions conducive for ascospore production and release commonly occur during the fall, winter, and springtime throughout the Pacific Northwest. Trap plants deployed weekly in multiple sites around the Willamette Valley in western Oregon, beginning in October 2014 and 2015, showed that ascospore infections began around mid-October. During 2015-2016, ascospore infections of trap plants occurred from mid-October into May with severe disease pressure during February and March. Wounding, insect injury, or herbicide injury can result in greater disease severity.
Two types of pycnidia (which produce asexual spores known as pycnidiospores) can be found; one on infected, live plants (thinner-walled pycnidium with a neck) and the other on crop residues (thicker-walled pycnidium with a narrow ostiole). Pycnidiospores are dispersed by splashing rain or irrigation water, so pycnidiospore movement is limited to relatively short distances, but pycnidio-spores can add to the overall incidence and severity of disease build-up within a field. Workers or equipment moving through infected plantings during wet conditions can spread disease.
Black leg can also move with infected seed, Leptosphaeria can survive for years in association with seed. But if, as a general practice, seed lots used for planting are Leptosphaeria-free then the spread of regional epidemics is thought to arise from infected plant debris. Even low levels of seed infec-tion, when coupled with weather favorable for disease, can lead to severe losses, including stand die-out within a field. The Oregon Department of Agriculture requires that all crucifer seed, even half ounce or smaller packets, that is to be planted in Oregon must be accompanied by an official test showing that the untreated seed is free from black leg (Leptosphaeria species).
This disease can reduce vegetable and seed yields. After a disease outbreak in a larger geographic area, the threat of yield loss is much greater due to the abundance of affected crop residues on soil surfaces, especially if field-wide epidemics occur in no-till fields. Widespread leaf spot and subsequent black leg stem cankers can result from unprotected plants being exposed to ascospores released from infected crop residues. Replanting or allowing volunteers to grow in a field after a black leg outbreak can result in high numbers of infected seedlings by fall in the Pacific Northwest, perpetuating disease. Planting adjacent to a previously infected field can result in a high disease incidence (40 to 60%) in a new planting by December while planting within a few miles of an infected residue site can result in generalized infections across new fields (1 to 5%). Researchers at OSU have observed uncontrolled black leg infections in fall-planted seed fields in western Oregon increase from a low disease incidence (1 to 5%) to high (40 to 90% of the stand infected) in a 6-week period. Infections of fall-planted fields can lead to stand losses through winter into the spring. Secondary diseases are common on plants with black leg; Sclerotinia, Botrytis, and soft rot bacteria are especially common on black leg-infected plants in western Oregon during rainy weather and may mask black leg infections by six weeks later.


","Generalized leaf spots, becoming numerous across the field, are commonly observed in fall-planted crops after initial windblown spore (ascospore) infections. Pale, irregular spots develop on cotyledons, leaves, stems, or petioles, later becoming somewhat circular to oval, ashy-gray colored with scattered tiny, black pycnidia. Sometimes the center of lesions will fall out, especially after heavy rainfall, but a narrow, ashy-gray band with pycnidia usually remains. Stem cankers develop after the fungus grows systemically from leaf spots down the plant. Cankers are elongated with purple-black borders, and often develop near the soil line. Stem infections commonly occur also higher up on kale plants and are often seen on leaf scars when fields have active black leg outbreaks. Stem cankers can girdle the stem as well as decay pith tissues, and extend below the soil surface, causing a brown-to-gray to black rot in the lower stem and roots. Vascular tissues turn black in color prior to external black leg disease symptoms. Damping-off can occur if plants are infected at the seedling stage, usually through the use of infected seeds. Plants produced from infected seeds that survive the seedling stage are stunted and often develop a rot of the stem at or just below the soil line, which moves upwards and can cause plant death.
Leaf spots may appear on over-wintered leaves at initially low levels but increase as pycnidiospores spread disease. In seed fields, as plants mature, they may fall sideways from lack of root anchorage due to disease weakening the plants or stem cankers may cause the top of the plant to fall over. Symptoms on seed pods are rare and inconspicuous. Black leg stem cankers in seed crops may be invaded by secondary pathogens, masking black leg symptoms on the stems of affected plants.


","

1) Plant only seed certified by official testing to be free of .

2) Avoid planting in or adjacent to a site where disease has occurred within the last 3 to 4 years; plantings within a quarter of a mile of a field containing black leg-infected crucifer residues are at high risk for developing black leg.

3) Delay spring plantings until the weather is drier to avoid periods of ascospore release.

4) Bury residues after harvest by deep plowing if possible, or remove plant debris. Multiple flailings (up to three passes) followed by a shallow incorporation may be sufficient depending on amount and size of plant debris as well as environmental conditions.

5) Control susceptible weeds and control volunteer crucifers.

6) Hot water seed treatment for 20 min. in water at 122°F (50°C).

7) For organic production, removal of affected leaves shortly after leaf spots develop, can reduce secondary spread within a planting as well as the incidence of stem cankers.

8) 

8.1) Seedbeds should not have crucifer crops on or near them for at least 5 years.
8.2) Transplants should not be dipped in water before transplanting.
8.3) Inspect seedbeds and seed fields for presence of the disease.
","Seed treatment and a foliar fungicide program will be essential if growing seed fields in any region where black leg epidemics have occurred across a larger geographic area. Infected seed can occur in seed lots, certified to be free of black leg, at levels below the detection threshold by seed testing, and chemical or hot water seed treatments will aid in controlling seedborne disease.

Kale ,(Brassica oleracea var. acephala)-Black Rot,"Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris, a bacterium that overwinters in plant refuse for up to 2 years and is carried internally and externally on seed. The bacterium infects other crucifer crops and weeds. It may be spread in the field by water (rain, irrigation), insects, equipment, and animals. Many outbreaks can be attributed to disease spread in the seedbed.
When spread by water, bacteria enter water pores (hydathodes) at leaf margins or occasionally through insect or other mechanical injuries. From the leaf, the infection proceeds up and down the main stem and then becomes systemic. Disease development may stop in unfavorable weather only to resume when conditions are favorable. Optimum temperatures for development are 80°F to 86°F. Water in the form of dew, rain, or sprinkler irrigation is necessary for spread.


","Tissue at leaf margins becomes yellow; chlorosis progresses toward the leaf center, creating a V-shaped area with the base of the ""V"" at the leaf midrib. Veins in these areas become dark brown or black; when the leaf is held up to a strong light source, they show up as a black net. Vascular tissue of the main stem then becomes blackened. As the infection becomes systemic, symptoms (the same as those found from direct infection) may appear anywhere on the plant. Unilateral stunting of some leaves occurs. In infected seed, the first symptoms appear on cotyledons, which rapidly wilt and drop off; usually however, the infection has reached the stem and proceeds up.

1) Use clean, pathogen-free seed. Seed from Western States generally is free from this disease.

2) Use a 2-year rotation out of crucifers in production fields.

Kale ,(Brassica oleracea var. acephala)-Damping-off (Wirestem),"The fungi or fungus-like microorganisms, Pythium spp., Fusarium spp. and Rhizoctonia solani, attack young seedlings of many vegetables, including members of the genus Brassica. These soilborne microorganisms can persist indefinitely in soil or plant debris. If seedlings are affected before emergence, it appears as poor germination. If the decay is after emergence, seedlings that fall over or die are said to ""damp-off."" The destructiveness of the disease depends on the amount of pathogen in the soil and on environmental conditions. Cool, cloudy weather, high humidity, wet soils, compacted soil, and overcrowding especially favor development of damping-off.


","Damping-off kills seedlings before or soon after they emerge. Beneath the soil a general rot is observed. Seedlings that emerge develop a lesion near where the tender stem contacts the soil surface, and the seedling collapses. In some cases, the seedling may continue to grow even though the lesion girdles the stem. The lesion is quite sunken, and the stem resembles a wire, hence the name wirestem. The girdled seedling eventually dies.


","

1) In the greenhouse or seedbed, pasteurize the soil with heat. Use good sanitation in greenhouses.

2) Locate seedbeds on well-drained soil, and avoid excessive irrigation.

3) Space rows and/or seedlings in the seedbed to maximize air movement.

4) Carefully examine seedlings when transplanting; discard any with signs of wirestem.

5) If damping-off occurs, stop watering for a while. Allow soil to dry somewhat around the plants. If the seedlings are in flats or in cold frames, give them as much air and light as possible.

6) Crop rotation with cereals may reduce pathogen populations in the soil.

7) Remove or encourage decomposition of plant debris.

Kale ,(Brassica oleracea var. acephala)-Downy Mildew,"Peronospora parasitica (= Hyaloperonospora parasitica), a fungus-like microorganism that overwinters in roots or infected plant debris, affects nearly all cultivated plants and weeds in the crucifer family. Several strains of the fungus; however, are specific to certain groupings of crops. High humidity, fog, drizzle, and heavy dew favor disease development and spread. Optimum conditions for disease development are night temperatures of 46°F to 61°F for 4 or more successive nights and day temperature approximately 75°F or lower. In areas with mild, wet winters, such as western Oregon or Washington, downy mildew can continue infecting fall-planted seed crops during the winter months, although only small amount of the total leaf surface area may be colonized on individual leaves, but this allows for a build-up within a field, potentially leading to severe increase in infections of spring growth if spring conditions are wet and mild. Fall and spring downy-mildew management is important for fall-planted seed fields to avoid extensive staghead formation, where an inflorescence is abnormal in shape and development due to downy mildew or white rust. White rust and downy mildew are commonly found cohabitating together in leaf colonies on brassicas in western Oregon and elsewhere.


","The first observable symptom is small, light green-yellow lesions on the upper leaf surface, later showing on the undersurface. The spot turns yellow as it enlarges. In high humidity, a grayish-white fungal growth is on the leaf's underside.
On fall-planted seed crops, downy mildew can create tiny leaf spots during the winter months or other times where small clusters of, even just a few, conidia and conidiophores are produced on the underside of the leaf surface; rarely in large enough quantity to be seen without magnification. During warmer rain breaks, individual lesions may rapidly enlarge and then quickly collapse with a secondary soft rot during rainy periods. This can be confused for cold-damaged tissues with subsequent secondary leaf rot, which can also be common in areas of Oregon and Washington seed production during certain winters.
In seed crops, downy mildew on an inflorescence can lead to staghead formation, abnormal shape and development of the inflorescence due to downy mildew or white rust. White rust and downy mildew are commonly found together in leaf colonies on Brassicas in western Oregon and elsewhere.

Kale ,(Brassica oleracea var. acephala)-Light Leaf Spot,"The fungus, Cylindrosporium concentricum (sexual stage: Pyrenopeziza brassicae) has been found in Oregon on canola, turnip, volunteer or wild radish, wild mustard, volunteer black mustard, vegetable Brassica seed fields, and Brassica species used as cover crops during 2014. The disease was found during 2016 in the Skagit Valley of western Washington on Brassica cover crops and wild mustard. All Brassicas grown all brassicas crops grown in the Pacific Northwest are probably susceptible but the specific host range within Brassicaceae is unknown at this time. Oilseed rape and cauliflower are reported to be more susceptible than Brussels sprouts or kale, but there is a range of susceptibility within each crop species. The pathogen has been a problem on oilseed rape in various parts of the world with seed losses estimated at 22% when outbreaks have occurred in the United Kingdom. This disease hasn't been previously reported in North America though an infected mustard field was found in western Oregon during 1998. Oilseed rape is very susceptible and losses results from stand die-out, reduced pod numbers, premature pod ripening, or an overall growth reduction with less severe infections. Brassicas grown as vegetables in other areas of the globe, where this disease has been reported, suffer blemish defects by relatively mild infections, causing a decrease in quality but not of yield quantity. Trichloroacetic acid-based herbicides may increase plant susceptibility by affecting the waxy layer of leaves.
Ascospores develop from apothecia on infected plant residues and can be wind-dispersed relatively long distances after a wetting period, infecting susceptible plants. Asexual spores (conidia) develop but spread relatively short distances by rain or splashing water, potentially causing pod infections during the following spring. Seed can be infected or casually infested with the asexual stage yet seed transmission occurs at very low rates due to rapid die-out of the pathogen on seed. Still, epidemics can be initiated by seedborne inoculum or from neighboring fields of infected plants or residues, or from infected volunteers. Wet conditions and cool temperatures (around 60°F is optimum) promote disease development. Fall-infected plants may remain symptomless through the winter season till the following spring. Light leaf spot reappeared during late February in western Oregon, but ascospores probably began infecting during the previous October and November, possibly throughout the winter.


","This fungus can attack leaves, stems and pods. Flecking may be observed on cotyledons while leaf infections start as discolored patches that develop into irregular brown lesions with cracked centers, sometimes turning black. Veins surrounding young lesions often take on an olive-brown hue and may exhibit deformities. Leaf lesions can coalesce, causing death of leaves. When leaves are infected young, distortion can develop. Stem lesions are superficial, elongated brownish streaks with grayish-black margins and can be mistaken for black leg, except decay does not affect the stem pith. Flower infections may cause abortion. Pods infected early appear distorted while pods infected later result in relatively healthy looking pods but will have white spore masses. Seedlings can be killed or plants may be stunted. Cauliflower will have a brown discoloration of curds while Brussels sprouts exhibit black lesions.


","

1) Rotate out of crucifers for 3 years.

2) Avoid planting adjacent to a field infected the previous season.

3) Control susceptible weeds and volunteer  plants.

4) Remove plant debris or bury by deep-plowing, important for preventing sexual recombinants from developing with new virulence or fungicide resistance. Flailing followed by a shallow incorporation may be sufficient depending on amount and size of plant debris as well as environmental conditions.

Kale ,(Brassica oleracea var. acephala)-Sclerotinia Stem Rot,"Sclerotinia sclerotiorum is a fungus that overwinters as small black structures (sclerotia) in plant debris or in soil. Sclerotia may survive up to 8 years in the soil or associated with plant debris. After a conditioning period of several weeks at 40°F in moist soil, sclerotia germinate in moist soil when temperatures are 59°F to 65°F and produce a small, stalked, cup-shaped fruiting structure (apothecium; plural: apothecia), which releases millions of spores into the air. Sporulating apothecia can persist 5 to 10 days. Spores are forcibly ejected and a few may be blown up to a mile but most land nearby. Spores can survive 2 weeks. Spores infect senescent tissue such as leaves or petals or wounded/injured tissue and then invade any healthy part of the plant it contacts. Sclerotinia has been observed to infect kale following Phoma lingam,  colonizing black leg stem lesions and eventually masking signs of P. lingam. Moist conditions within the plant canopy favor infection by S. sclerotiorum. Rain, dew, and/or irrigation practices that keep foliage wet for long periods favor white-mold development.
Other host plants are numerous and include bean, carrots, cabbage as well as other brassicas, cucurbits, lettuce, parsnip, pea, potato, radish, and sunflower. Dandelion (Taraxacum officinale) is a very susceptible weed host.


","The disease is mainly on aboveground parts, producing a cottony-white mold. As leaves, petioles, or stems decay, small white bodies appear in the fluffy white mold and gradually change from white to black as hardened sclerotia develop.


","

1) Reduce humidity and high-moisture periods within the plant canopy and field:

1.2) Orientating the rows in the direction of prevailing winds is useful for white-mold control if the placement of irrigation equipment allows row orientation.
1.3) Time irrigations to allow drying of plant canopy before night fall.
1.4) Apply sufficient nitrogen to meet crop demands, but avoid excessive fertilization that can lead to dense, lush plant growth.
2) To reduce pathogen population within a field:

2.1) Rotate with non-hosts for 8 years to achieve best control, but for at least 2 years to reduce population of sclerotia; grasses, cereals, and onion are not affected by white mold.

Kale ,(Brassica oleracea var. acephala)-White Leaf Spot and Gray Stem,"The fungus, Pseudocercosporella capsellae (sexual stage: Mycosphaerella capsellae), has been observed in various Brassica vegetable and seed crops in Oregon. It has been reported in oilseed rape in the United Kingdom and Canada. Pod losses of 15% have been reported in Europe. Turnip, Chinese cabbage, mustards and oilseed rape are thought to be more susceptible than cabbage, cauliflower, broccoli and other vegetable Brassica species. Horseradish and radish are susceptible to white leaf spot as well as weedy types such as wild radish, wild mustard, and shepherd's purse.
Ascospores develop on infected Brassica or Raphanus residues during the autumn and possibly winter or spring months; these ascospores are wind-dispersed relatively long distances following rain or dew events. After a successful infection, asexual spores (conidia) subsequently develop in the leaf spots and are spread relatively short distances by rain or splashing water, causing secondary spread, including pod and seed infections. Seed transmission has not been reported to play a major role in disease outbreaks; infected crop residues are usually necessary for large-scale outbreaks, but seed transmission can lead to introduction of disease into new areas. Temperatures of 50°F to 60°F with moist conditions (rain, dew, or irrigation) promote disease development.


","This fungus can attack leaves, stems and pods. Tan, irregular or roundish spots develop on leave, especially leaf tips and edges, later becoming ashy-gray to white with a brownish margin and sometimes a yellowish halo. White conidia can be observed on the underside of leaf spots. Leaf spots will become dark brown as leaves senesce, due to the initiation of the sexual stage. The center of older lesions may fall out, resulting in a shot hole appearance. Lesions may coalesce when disease is severe, resulting in defoliation. Stem lesions are elongated and first brown, turning ashy-gray to white with a brownish margin and numerous tiny dark specks due to the formation of the sexual stage; there is a distinct boundary between diseased and healthy tissue on the stem. Gray stem lesions are superficial, the pith is not severely infected, helping to distinguish gray stem from black leg. Pod infections are at first small brown spots that expand and turn grayish-white with numerous tiny dark specks due to the formation of the sexual stage.

Kalmia ,(Mountain Laurel)-Phytophthora Blight,"Phytophthora syringae, a fungus-like microorganism. Disease develops in winter and early spring during cold, rainy weather. Rain-splashed inoculum begins the infections generally on the lower leaves. Infected leaves fall off the plant and sporangia produced on these leaves during cold, rainy weather can spread the disease. Oospores in the leafy debris and soil allow the pathogen to survive until the following winter. This Phytophthora species only infects the aboveground parts of plants.


","Irregular necrotic spots develop on the leaves. They often affect the leaf tips. Symptoms usually begin on the lowest leaves, nearest the ground, then progress upwards, leading to defoliated stems. Stems may also become black and necrotic. New buds and shoots become infected and defoliate, leading to branch dieback. Symptoms are similar to those caused by other foliar-infecting Phytophthora species but Phytophthora blight will occur during the winter and early spring.


","

1) Rake up and destroy dead leaves around the base of the plant.

2) Prune off infected leaves and branches.

3) Mulch to prevent inoculum in soil from being splashed onto the lower leaves.

4) Avoid reusing pots from a previous crop for propagation. If pots must be reused then wash off all debris and soak in a sanitizing solution or treat with aerated steam for 30 min.

5) Prevent potted plants in nurseries from falling over allowing foliage to touch the ground.

","Use fungicides as preventative treatments. Tank-mix and/or alternate products from different groups with different modes of action to prevent the buildup of resistant fungi.

Kalmia ,(Mountain Laurel)-Root Rot,"Both Phytophthora sp. and Pythium sp. have been isolated in the OSU Plant Clinic. Phytophthora cinnamomi has been reported several times and Phytophthora hydropathica has been found both in irrigation water and from root-crowns of wilting plants. Excess water is the most important factor favoring disease development. These fungi survive unfavorable periods in soil and infected plant debris. Under favorable conditions, spores germinate and infect roots. After infection, the fungus-like microorganism spreads mainly in the inner bark tissues of the root and stems. They survive as various spores in the soil, container media, or infected roots. Movement of infected plants and/or soil can spread this microorganism.


","Aboveground symptoms are general for root rots and may include yellowing, wilting, or death of the plant. Infected roots are discolored and have few if any feeder roots. When roots are gently pulled, the outer cortex often sloughs off. Infections may progress up into the root crown as indicated by a reddish brown discoloration of the vascular cambium. A root-crown rot may also be found with some species of Phytophthora.


","

1) Adjust irrigation schedule to keep from waterlogging plants.

2) Provide good drainage for plants in beds, fields, or containers. Place containers on gravel beds (4 inches or more deep) to allow drainage. Do not place containers on poly sheets; they can prevent containers from draining into soil and allow contaminated drainage water to spread from the base of one container to another.

3) Remove and destroy all infected plants and plant debris.

4) Avoid reusing pots from a previous crop for propagation. If pots must be reused then wash off all debris and soak in a sanitizing solution or treat with aerated steam for 30 min.

","Use fungicides as preventative treatments. Tank-mix and/or alternate products from different groups with different modes of action to prevent the buildup of resistant fungi. The Group 4 and 33 fungicides used to manage oomycetes do not kill these organisms. They can only prevent establishment of the organism before it gets into the plant. They can also prevent continued growth if the organism is already inside the plant thereby delaying symptoms that might have developed. Once chemical activity has subsided with time, the organism can resume growth within infected plants.

Kinnikinnick ,(Arctostaphylos uva-ursi)-Black Root Rot,,,,,
Kinnikinnick ,(Arctostaphylos uva-ursi)-Leaf Gall,"Large white to brown leaf and flower galls are caused by Exobasidium spp. Several species have been reported from the Pacific Northwest including E. vaccinii, which is common on azalea as well as other Arctostaphylos spp., E. arctostaphyli, E. uva-ursi and E. vaccinii-uliginosi. It is not clear if isolates from azalea can infect kinnikinnick or visa versa. An aphid (Manzanita leaf fall aphid) causes smaller, red leaf galls. See the PNW Insect Management Handbook for more information.


","Initially, infected plant parts show a thickening and then gradually become fleshy in appearance. Infected leaves and flowers thicken into greenish to pinkish galls. As the galls mature, they become covered with a dense white coating of fungal spores. Galls finally become brown and woody. Healthy plants can easily tolerate considerable amounts of galling without serious damage.


","

1) Avoid overhead watering or limit it to times when the foliage can dry quickly.

2) Pick and destroy thickened, fleshy leaves and flowers before the white fungal spores appear.

3) Remove these old galls from plants before bloom and flushes of new growth.

4) Space plants and prune to reduce humidity.

5) The cultivar Massachusetts is reported resistant to leaf gall.

Kinnikinnick ,(Arctostaphylos uva-ursi)-Leaf Spot,"Several fungi have been associated with leaf spots of Arctostaphylos uva-ursi (kinnikinnick or bearberry). Gloeosporium arctostaphyli has been reported from Idaho and Washington. Phyllosticta sp. has been commonly isolated from leaf spots by plant clinics in Oregon and Washington. Mycosphaerella pyrolae (formerly Phyllosticta pyrolae), and P. vaccinii (as well as many other fungi) were most frequently isolated from healthy leaves collected from western Oregon.


","Gloeosporium arctostaphyli spots are at first purple, then black with purple margins, more distinct from the upper surface.

Kinnikinnick ,(Arctostaphylos uva-ursi)-Phytophthora Dieback,"The fungal-like organism Phytophthora sp. has been found in both the nursery and landscape. In one case an isolate of P. citricola was found in diseased nursery plants. Although identification to a specific species has rarely been done, none have been P. ramorum which can also infect Arctostaphylos spp. Records indicate that P. nemorsa and P. pseudosyringae have also been recovered but it is unclear where these plants were growing. Kinnikinnick was found to be very susceptible when inoculated with P. cactorum, P. cinnamomi, P. citricola, or P. citrophthora.
Plants in this family are low water users. Poorly drained, waterlogged soil or media favors these water-mold organisms. The organisms survive unfavorable periods as oospores or chlamydospores in plant debris. Low temperatures, wet conditions and wounds also favor above ground disease development.


","Nursery-grown plants have shown stem and root rots as well as leaf blighting and twig dieback. Landscape plants generally have branch diebacks. Foliar discoloration and leaf blighting may also occur.

Kiwifruit ,(Actinidia spp.)-Gray Mold,"Botrytis cinerea, a fungus. This is an important postharvest problem in cold storage. Overwintering sclerotia and mycelium produce abundant conidia in winter and spring. Conidia infect petals and anthers under warm, moist conditions during bloom. Sepals and receptacles can become infected from 30 days after flowering through harvest in California. Infections remain latent until fruit mature and are harvested. Picking wounds can also be infection sites. Fruit from vines near pollinator vines show a greater incidence of this disease. The fungus grows slowly under cold storage conditions.


","Generally, gray mold is not seen in the field. It is near the stem end of the fruit after 3 to 4 weeks in cold storage. Affected areas appear darker than the healthy part of the fruit. The discoloration advances evenly toward the base of the fruit. Internally, infected tissue turns dark green and is water soaked. White to gray mycelium and sporulation may be present. Sclerotia are jelly-like and white. As decay advances, other fruit may also become involved. Infection through picking wounds may develop into a side rot.

Lawn and Turf,Anthracnose,"Spores of Colletotrichum graminicola spread from infected debris to healthy plants during warm, moist weather. The disease is common but a serious problem only on plants under stress, especially when soil is dry and leaves are wet. Conditions that stress turfgrass include low mowing height, mechanical injury, and extreme temperatures. Sand topdressing and application wetting agents have been shown to reduce disease activity on putting greens. One of the problems with this disease is the small voids of bare soil that it leaves, which cause an unpredictable ball roll. There is speculation that high sulfur rates can lead to more anthracnose.


","The disease has two phases. One is the anthracnose (leaf blight) phase, active in summer; in which yellow to brown lesions appear on older leaves and sheaths. As the disease progresses, abundant fungal fruiting bodies (acervuli) covered with black hairs (setae) are on lesions. Infected areas appear in summer as irregular areas of thinned, blighted grass that are brown to yellow-tan to gray. They may be only a few inches or several feet in diameter.
The second phase is a basal stem rot usually noticed in fall and winter in western Oregon and Washington. Older leaves begin to turn yellow at the tips, then turn a bright orange-red. Infected areas usually are small, resulting in nickel-size patches of yellow to orange plants. The bases of leaf sheaths appear darkened and separate easily from crowns. The basal rot phase is more severe after wounding from top dressing and aeration practices.


","Promote vigorous turf growth.

1) Maintain an adequate, balanced nutritional program including 0.5 to 0.75 lb N/1000 sq ft every month from April through September (totaling 3 to 4.5 lbs N/1,000 sq ft). Light frequent application of nitrogen will allow for consistent green speed and decreased disease activity. Suggested nitrogen to potassium ratio is 2:1.

2) Water grass thoroughly when needed but avoid dry-down cycles. Wetting agents used monthly can be helpful staring in April or May.

3) Remove thatch and aerify compacted areas with a combination of vertical mowing and core cultivation.

4) Mow higher in periods of stress such as dry or hot weather.

5) Topdress annual bluegrass putting greens with a light layer of sand every two weeks.

","Make the first application 3 weeks prior to first symptom development. Applications during the summer for leaf blight reduce the potential for basal rot. Also, make protective applications prior to aerification. Use higher rates, and use enough water to adequately wet crown area when trying to control crown rot. Applications after the basal rot phase is noticed will not be effective.
Tolerant strains of many fungal pathogens can become troublesome when a single fungicide is used exclusively in a spray schedule. To prevent developing resistant fungi, alternate or tank-mix materials from different groups with different modes of action. Limit the use of any one group during crop production. Group 11 fungicides are not recommended in California due to widespread resistance. Use Group 3 fungicides early and/or late in the season. Do not combine Group 3 fungicides with growth regulators, such as Primo, or a brown tingeing may develop.

Lawn and Turf,Brown Blight,"Pyrenophora lolii (formerly Drechslera siccans) causes a foliar disease also referred to as winter brown blight. This fungus survives unfavorable conditions in infected plants and plant debris. Leaf infections are most common in cooler months. Conidia spread by wind, splashing rain, grass clippings, or by equipment. Generally worse on young stands in their first autumn and on turf with low nitrogen fertility.


","Tiny, chocolate-brown spots to large, dark-brown streaks up to 0.4-inch long appear on perennial ryegrass leaves. Girdled leaves become yellow and die back from the tip. The stand turns brown, becomes thin, and looks drought stressed.

Lawn and Turf,Damping-off,"Pythium sp., Rhizoctonia sp., Fusarium, and other fungi. Damping-off is quite common in Oregon in wet weather on newly seeded lawns, either soon after seed germinates or seedlings emerge. Seeding rate is a critical factor when preventing damping-off. When seed is applied in excess, the turf will not have enough resources (water or nutrients) to grow, which will increase susceptibility to this disease. In addition, excessive seeding rates allow the hyphae of the pathogen(s) to easily move from one turf plant to the next because of close proximity.
Fusarium survives in the soil as thick-walled, dormant chlamydospores, which germinate in response to exudates from nearby plant roots. Hyphae then penetrate the roots, colonize the cortex, and move into the xylem tissue. Small spores (microconidia) are produced and carried up into the plant. Damping-off caused by Fusarium is prevalent during cool, wet conditions.
Rhizoctonia survives in the soil as sclerotia or as mycelium colonizing bits of organic matter. Roots become infected as they grow past these structures. The fungus then grows along the root surface, forms an aggregation called an infection cushion, pushes into the root where it colonizes, and spreads and kills the tissue. The fungus can form knots of mycelium that develop into sclerotia. These are released into the soil as the plant debris decomposes. Damping-off caused by Rhizoctonia (or Pythium) occurs during hot, wet conditions that are typical during summer seeding when frequent irrigation is required. Avoid seeding during periods of extreme temperatures will help avoid this disease.


","Young plants wither, turn brown, and die, leaving irregular bare patches 1 inch or more in diameter.


","

1) Seeding in the spring (prior to Memorial Day) and in the fall (after Labor Day) will promote turfgrass establishment and greatly reduce the development of damping-off by avoiding extreme temperatures (hot or cold).

2) Provide good drainage during initial soil preparation.

3) Avoid excessive watering after seeding.

4) Avoid excess seeding rates (for example, max seeding rates are 11 lbs of perennial ryegrass/1,000 sq ft and 3 lbs of Kentucky bluegrass/1,000 sq ft).

Lawn and Turf,Dog Injury,"Animal urine does more damage on dry soils, where the salts cannot be easily dispersed. Female dogs are usually more damaging as they urinate on the ground, in the same spot and tend to empty their bladders more completely than males. This results in a higher concentration of acids, salts, ammonium, nitrates and phosphates in those areas. Male dogs tend to urinate on vertical objects including plants but do not empty their bladders nearly as much resulting in less urine distributed in a wider area. The more dilute the urine the less toxic it is to the lawn. Also, pH alone has no effect on lawn burn.


","Dog injury typically appears on lawns as brown, circular patches a few inches in diameter. These patches may be surrounded in a few days by a ring of darker green, more vigorous grass, resulting from the nitrogen in the urine. Samples of the dead grass placed in a plastic bag will release ammonia, which can be detected by smell. Urine damage can be mistaken for symptoms of several patch-type diseases. Other chemical injury such as fertilizer spills or salt spills can cause similar symptoms but do not release an ammonia odor.


","

1) Overseed damaged spots with a grass seed mix similar to the lawn composition to fill in spots and prevent weed invasion.

2) Water spots to help dilute the concentration of urea in the dog's urine.

3) Plant more resistant grass species.

4) Fence lawn areas off to dog access.

5) Fertilize lawn evenly if excessive greening in spots is considered the problem.

Lawn and Turf,Dollar Spot,"A fungus where the taxonomy is uncertain but is currently known as Sclerotinia homoeocarpa. This fungus survives in the thatch and soil. Infection occurs through the leaves but roots are not infected. Favorable conditions include prolonged leaf wetness and dry soil conditions coupled with warm days and cool nights. These are typical fall conditions in the Pacific Northwest. Low nitrogen fertility is also a major factor in disease development. This disease is an infrequent or sporadic problem in the PNW where numerous patches may be seen during a favorable fall but not again for several more years. Prevalent on both sides of the Cascade Range.


","Small, roughly circular, bleached patches develop in the turf. Spots are generally a few inches in diameter but can exceed 6 inches when conditions are favorable. Numerous spots may occur and coalesce into large, irregular dead areas. Leaves develop light yellow to tan lesions with reddish-brown borders or lines. Lesions occur near the middle of the leaf and extend completely across the leaf blade. Leaf tips may dieback, and severely affected plants, within dollar spot patches, will wilt and turn tan to brown.


","

1) Fertilize with adequate nitrogen in a balanced nutritional program.

2) Avoid light, frequent waterings. Use enough water, based on local growing conditions. Water in morning so turf will dry before night.

3) Morning dew removal has been effective at reducing disease incidence and severity in Eastern states.

4) Increased mowing frequency has been associated with better disease management; however, it may only be associated with dew removal practices.

5) Daily rolling has been shown to substantially reduce dollar spot activity, particularly when coupled with an increased mowing height.

","Focus on cultural control tactics first. Resistance to many fungicide groups has been reported from many areas of the country. Alternate or tank-mix fungicides from different groups that have different modes of action. Limit the use of any one group during crop production. Plant growth regulators have been used to enhance disease management when combined with fungicides. Type II PGRs, however, will encourage resistance development to Group 3 fungicides. It has also been reported that application of Group 7 fungicides, such as Emerald, also select for the resistance to Group 3 fungicides. Isolates resistance to thiophanate methyl are more likely to be resistant to group 2, 3, and 7 fungicides.

Lawn and Turf,Fairy Ring and Mushrooms,"Nearly 60 different species of basidomycete fungi have been implicated in fairy rings including species of Agraricales and Gastromycetales, mostly in the genera Agaricus, Calvatia, Chlorophyllum, Clitocybe, Lepiota, Lycoperdon, Marasmius, Scleroderma, and Tricholoma. Some may be poisonous. They decompose organic matter such as dead tree roots and bark mulch. Fairy rings are more severe on sandy soils, where fertility is low, and when drought is common. Necrotic grass is most commonly an artifact of drought-stressed turf, caused by a combination of dense fungal mycelium and the production of organic acids that coat sand particles and render the underlying soil hydrophobic. All grasses are affected. The problem is common in Oregon, Washington, and northern Idaho.


","Rings or semicircles of dark green grass, which expand outward over several years. Mushrooms or puffballs may grow out of the green zone. Dead grass sometimes is inside the ring adjacent to the ring of dark green grass. It is possible for fairy rings to grow into and then through and out of a turf area. Fairy rings are of minor importance in home lawns.


","

1) Rake or mow off mushrooms or puffballs. They will quickly decompose and can be composted.

2) Mask symptoms by fertilizing and watering to promote grass growth.

3) Aerate soil by coring to aid water penetration in the rings themselves. Then drench with water plus a wetting agent.

4) In extreme cases, it may be necessary to renovate the area by removing sod and thoroughly mixing the top 6 to 8 inches of soil with a rototiller. Reseed or sod when finished.

","Not generally recommended because it is difficult to disperse chemical effectively throughout the soil. Curative suppression with fungicides has been marginal due to the water-repellent nature of the infested soil. Success is limited, and results may be erratic. Mixing with soil surfactants has helped. Preventative applications were useful in North Carolina but efficacy in the PNW is unknown.

Lawn and Turf-Microdochium Patch ,(Pink Snow Mold),"A fungus, Monographella nivalis (formerly Microdochium nivale or Fusarium nivale), that survives in diseased grass and dead plant debris. The disease occurs in spring and fall and is very common on golf course putting greens from September through May in western Oregon and Washington and in northern Idaho. The most severe damage is in early spring just as snow starts to melt. Snow is not required for damage to occur.
Leaf-to-leaf spread of the fungus is favored by alternate thawing and snow cover, repeated frosts, cold fogs, and light drizzling rain. Humid conditions >90% humidity for 24 hours or more and temperatures between 46°F and 68°F are favorable for disease development. Infection occurs through stomata and is more a problem on turf cut low and in shaded areas. High nitrogen fertility also favors disease development.


","During cool, wet weather, reddish brown circular patches (1 to 2 inches in diameter) of turf appear. White or pinkish fungal growth may be at the advancing edge of the patch. Patches may enlarge and coalesce to form extensive affected areas. The center is generally tan and may contain uninjured grass. In areas with snow cover, the fungus may grow beneath the snow or, more commonly, as snow melts.


","

1) Do not overfertilize with nitrogen. Use a balanced fertilizer with moderate nitrogen (such as 5-1-4). When nitrogen applications throughout the late fall to early spring is desired for turfgrass recuperation, research in western Oregon has shown that low rates of urea (0.1 lbs. nitrogen per 1000 sq ft) applied every two weeks on annual bluegrass putting greens has not resulted in an increase in Microdochium patch severity.

2) Ammonium sulfate is all right on bentgrass greens but not on annual bluegrass greens.

3) Mow and remove clippings until growth ceases in fall.

4) Promote good air and soil drainage.

5) Daily morning dew removal by rolling has been effective at reducing the disease in western Oregon.

","Not recommended for home lawns because grass often recovers when the weather changes. On golf greens and other high-maintenance turf areas, scout regularly starting in September. Concentrate scouting in early spring just as snow starts to melt. Apply fungicides once symptoms are detected and/or when fall rains begin.
Most Group 3 fungicides, except propiconazole, have been weak in western Oregon trials. Tolerant strains of many fungal pathogens can become troublesome if a single fungicide is used exclusively in a spray schedule. To prevent developing resistant fungi, alternate or tank-mix materials from different groups with different modes of action. Limit the use of any one group during crop production.

"
Lawn and Turf,Moss,"Moss is a primitive plant that can be a weed in turf. Moss is enhanced by human activity, especially by closely mowing in late fall, which chops up the plants and distributes fragments over the lawn. The most common moss found in lawns and gardens in Corvallis, OR was Eurhynchium praelongum and Scleropodium touretii. Brachythecium species are also found in home lawns but rare in putting greens; Bryum spp. are important in greens. Many other species also can grow and become weedy. Although moss often is associated with moist, shady sites, there are species adapted to many different environments including dry, open sites. Mosses need contact with moisture to grow but can survive in a desiccated state for long periods. If a healthy turf stand cannot be maintained at a site, the moss will continue to be a problem. No amount of moss killer will change this.


","When moss first colonizes an area, it produces a black slimy mat across the area before the green vegetative structures form. The green structures are composed of branch-like filaments called protonema and are easily confused with algae. These then bud out and give rise to more familiar green structures. Mosses can take many shapes and forms. Stems and leaves are complex with conducting strands, midribs, and a great diversity of cell forms. Leaves may be grouped in pairs, threes, and even sets of five.
Eurhynchium praelongum is a regularly to irregularly branching, sprawling moss of light- to dark-green color.
Scleropodium touretii has cylindrical (julaceous), spreading branches that form low mats. It is usually found on soil, which are dry during part of the year.
Bryum argentium is found on open sites and has a silvery appearance. B. lisae colonies are green to yellow-green tufts or clumps.


","The most successful long-term strategy for moss control is to grow grass that out-competes the moss. Excessive moisture must be eliminated and the proper species of grass must be planted in the problem areas. Maintaining grass, by proper watering and fertilization to promote growth, helps to exclude the moss.

1) Ensure good drainage through aeration, installation of drainage, and/or sand topdressing.

2) Control thatch to promote good rooting of turf plants and to enhance drainage.

3) Maintain soil pH between 5.8 and 6.6 and provide adequate nutrition with a balanced fertilizer program. Fertilize golf greens with 0.5 lb N/1000 sq ft per month. Increase K to 0.6 lb/1000 sq ft per month, and apply 0.1 to 0.2 lb iron/1000 sq ft per month.

4) Provide good air circulation and adequate sunlight by pruning nearby trees and shrubs.

5) Do not overwater turf. Be sure to irrigate sufficiently during the dry season to promote growth.

6) Mow turf at the correct cutting height for the species of grass grown.

7) Try to remove moss by hand or by power-raking. Reseed with a grass species more suited to the site. For shady sites, try , colonial bentgrass, or annual bluegrass. Fine and tall fescues have marginal shade tolerance, and Kentucky bluegrass and perennial ryegrasses have poor shade tolerance.

8) Consider alternatives to turf if good conditions for turf growth cannot be met.

","These must be used in conjunction with the cultural controls above for successful control. Dethatch first and then apply these products so you get good uniform coverage.


1) Treat with ferrous sulfate applied to dampened plant surface when moss is growing most actively. For best results, remove as much moss as possible by hand or by power-raking before treatment. Turfgrass temporarily darkens for 1 week after treatment. Sidewalks and driveways are permanently stained by these materials.

Lawn and Turf,Necrotic Ringspot,"The soilborne fungus Ophiosphaerella korrae (formerly Leptosphaeria korrae) infects turf with excessive rhizomatous-thatch accumulation. Using soil organic matter as a food base, the fungus infects roots, rhizomes, and the base of shoots in the fall during periods of cool, wet weather. The pathogen forms dark strands of mycelium that run parallel to the root axis. Infections typically develop in the fall compromising the turfgrass rooting system; however, symptoms are typically not visible until the following summer when heat and drought stress is coupled with the comprised rooting system. It overwinters in infected plant material. It has become a common problem in eastern and western Washington and in central and eastern Oregon, particularly on 2- to 5-year-old Kentucky bluegrass turf established from sod. Turf established from seed also has shown the disease but much less frequently. The disease also has been found in Idaho and British Columbia.


","Dead circles and arcs ranging from several inches to several feet in diameter are most obvious during the summer months during periods of heat and drought stress. When the disease is active, the affected areas' margin is reddish brown. Short-necked, black pseudothecia sometimes are found on infected crowns and roots. Weeds or resistant grass species often invade the dead turf area. Necrotic ringspot can be confused with yellow patch and Microdochium patch because the diseases have similar foliar symptoms and occur in autumn and spring. Unlike the latter two diseases, whose symptoms usually subside in late spring, necrotic ringspot can occur throughout the growing season and is characterized by a blackening of roots and rhizomes and by dark-brown ectotrophic hyphae on dying roots, rhizomes, and crowns. In the later stages of infection, black fruiting bodies (pseudothecia) occasionally are on these tissues.


","

1) Use mixtures of two or more grass species and two or more resistant cultivars to reduce the possibility of disease.

2) No Kentucky bluegrass cultivar is immune to this disease; however, cultivars differ in susceptibility. Cultivars Alpine, NE80-88, Princeton-104, Mystic, Joy, and I-13 consistently have less disease than HV-97 (Cocktail), Annika, Amazon, Opal, Trampas, and Sydsport. Avoid the latter cultivars.

3) Aggressive organic-matter management, annual core cultivation and vertical mowing, is essential for management of this pathogen within rhizomatous grasses.

4) Maintain good growing conditions for turf by proper fertilizing and watering.

5) Avoid high-nitrogen and quick-release fertilizers.

6) Avoid over-watering turf in the fall months. If symptoms are observed in the summer months, light and frequent irrigation will be required to sustain growth of the turf with a previously compromised rooting system.

7) Sulfur applications are ineffective in controlling necrotic ringspot on bluegrass; however, a balanced fertilizer that includes sulfur helps turf recover.

","Use in conjunction with cultural practices. Research in the Pacific Northwest has shown that one (1) or two (2) applications of some Group 3 fungicides effectively control the disease when the equivalent of 0.5 to 1 oz active ingredient is applied per 1000 sq ft in late fall or spring. For optimum control of problematic sites, initiate fungicide applications in the fall months prior to the development of symptoms.

Lawn and Turf,Nematodes,"One or more of at least 14 different types of nematode that cause disease by penetrating roots or sucking sap from the root surface with a mouth part like a hypodermic needle. In addition to the damage they cause by feeding, they leave wounds through which parasitic fungi can enter. Most of these nematodes tend to be migratory ectoparasites, but endoparasites are present as well.
A survey of golf course greens in Oregon and Washington found primarily the root-knot nematodes Meloidogyne naasi in both states and Meloidogyne minor on two courses in Washington.


","Infested turf lacks vigor and may be discolored, stunted, or thin and may wilt and die in irregular patches. Generally, it resembles turf stressed from fertilizer burn, hard soil, lack of water, or nutrient deficiency.

Lawn and Turf,Net Blotch,"Pyrenophora dictyoides (formerly Drechslera dictyoides) causes foliar disease on tall and fine fescues and perennial and annual ryegrasses. This fungal disease is most severe on young stands in wet, shady areas. The fungus survives unfavorable conditions in plant debris or in infected plants. Leaf infections are most common in cooler months. Conidia spread by wind, splashing rain, grass clippings, or by equipment.


","Fine fescue-small, reddish brown spots girdle leaves, causing dieback from the tip. Small brown patches of dead foliage may be found over large areas of fine fescue if the disease is severe.
Tall fescue and perennial ryegrass-short brown streaks run parallel and perpendicular to the leaf axis, producing a net-like symptom on leaves. Heavily infected stands turn yellow, then brown.


","

1) Plant resistant cultivars: Ranger perennial ryegrass reportedly has high resistance to net blotch, Gator has good resistance, and Manhattan II has some resistance.

2) Fertilize lightly.

3) Mow 2 to 2.5 inches tall and remove clippings.

4) Avoid light, frequent waterings. Use enough water, based on local growing conditions. Water in morning so turf will dry before night.

5) Remove excess thatch in early spring and aerify if needed to provide good aeration and drainage.

6) Remove turf in heavily-shaded areas.

Lawn and Turf,Rapid Blight,"Labyrinthula terrestris, a microscopic organism in the kingdom Chromista,  which thrives when soils or water have elevated salt levels (salinity levels typically above 2.0dS/m are associated with symptom development) as may occur when poor-quality irrigation water is used or under reduced irrigation conditions. Cells of this organism can be observed microscopically within infected plant tissue. First confirmed as a disease in California in 1995, the disease has been found in numerous states including Washington. Symptoms are more severe when poor water quality or amount of irrigation to the turf results in an increase in salinity in the soil. The pathogen can thrive in the range between 50°F and 93°F maximum daytime air temperature. This organism colonizes the foliage, crowns, and roots in affected areas.


","Symptoms develop as irregularly shaped patches of darkened or sometimes chlorotic turf. Infected turf may look water-soaked and darker in color than surrounding healthy plants. Small patches a few inches in diameter, enlarge and may rapidly coalesce killing large portions of turf. Symptoms may resemble damage from salinity or may look similar to foliar damage from Pythium blight. Although infection occurred during warm periods, symptoms did not show up until it cooled.


","

1) Reduce salinity of irrigation water and soil by leaching with less saline water.

2) Application of calcium sources to reduce sodium in the soil may lessen disease severity but is unlikely to provide complete control.

3) Avoid overseeding with highly-susceptible turf species.

4) Aerate to improve surface drainage as needed

","Control is difficult as multiple fungicide applications are often needed to eradicate the pathogen from the crowns, upper roots, and thatch for complete control. Tolerant strains of many fungal pathogens can become troublesome when some fungicides are used exclusively in a spray schedule.

Lawn and Turf,Red Thread,"The disease formerly was known as Corticium red thread and is caused by the fungus Laetisaria fuciformis. Commonly seen in Oregon and Washington, it is primarily cosmetic and rarely kills any grass. Fungi live on diseased grass and in soil. Red thread is more severe on lawns low in vigor. It is typically more severe when nitrogen is limited and alleviated by nitrogen applications. This disease can develop under a wide variety of environmental conditions, however, it is most frequently observed in the fall during periods of humid weather.


","Circular, irregular yellow patches, 2 to 24 inches, become brown and dead-looking. Affected aerial parts are bound together with a faintly pinkish web. Small, pink or red, horn-like (antler-like) sclerotia of fungus on leaf blades are a sure indication of red thread.


","This disease can be controlled with cultural practices alone.

1) Fertilize with a quick-release nitrogen source at rate of 0.5 to 1.0 lbs N/1,000 sq ft.

2) Prevent drought stress by using an adequate amount of water based on local growing conditions.

Lawn and Turf,Rusts,"Several rust fungi including many species of Puccinia and Uromyces. The most prevalent turf rust fungi are Puccinia graminis (causes stem rust), P. striiformis (stripe rust), P. coronate (crown rust), and P. recondite and P. brachypodii (leaf rust). Rust diseases are more severe on slow-growing or stressed grasses. Shade, drought, poor nutrition, and incorrect mowing height are possible causes of stress. The fungi overwinter in diseased grass and can be spread by wind.


","Yellow specks on the leaf blades followed by development of yellow, orange, dark-orange-brown, or red rust pustules on either or both leaf surfaces. Infection may also be on stems and leaf sheaths. Severe rust infections can kill leaf blades and may cause the turfgrass to appear thin or weak. Weedy species can infest weakened turfgrass. Affected areas of the lawn may show a reddish, brown, or yellow tint.


","

1) Fertilize and water to maintain rapid growth.

2) Cut lawn frequently and remove clippings to reduce spread during active outbreaks.

3) Plant rust-tolerant cultivars such as Rugby, Glade, Galaxy, Merion, A-34, Sydsport, and Baron. These cultivars are not completely resistant, so plant them in mixtures of two or more.

Lawn and Turf-Septoria Leaf Spot ,(Tip Blight),"A fungus, Septoria sp., that survives unfavorable weather in winter and summer as mycelium and fruiting bodies (pycnidia) in infected plants and debris. In cool rain, spores in pycnidia ooze out and are splashed by water or carried on equipment to healthy plants. The fungus thrives in cool, moist weather. Undernourished, unmowed, or long turf suffers increased damage. Many grasses are affected. Extensive damage is not commonly observed.


","Spots usually develop near leaf tips. They are gray or gray-green before fading to a pale yellow and eventually whitish gray. They can be up to 1 inch or more long. Very small brown or black fruiting bodies (pycnidia) of the fungus are scattered in the dead area. The overall final appearance is a mass of burned leaf tips.


","

1) Follow recommendations for Lawn and Turf-Leaf Spot.

2) Plant disease-tolerant cultivars such as Glade, Rugby, Galaxy, Bonnieblue, A-34, and Sydsport. These cultivars are not completely resistant, so plant them in mixtures of two or more.

Lawn and Turf,Slime Molds,"Any of several nonparasitic fungi, such as Physarum cinereum, that live on organic debris and use leaf blades as supports during their reproductive phase. They can live on just about anything that remains cool and moist from live plants to basement walls. At some time in their life cycle, the slime mold individuals gather together to form a larger (visible to us) reproductive unit. This unit can creep across surfaces by a process called protoplasmic streaming. These units produce fruiting structures and spores, after which they usually disappear. Slime molds can occur on all grasses. The slime mold Fuligo septica looks like dog vomit or scrambled eggs when seen on turf or mulch.


","Globular or spherical structures form on grass blades. They may be white or gray and often turn purplish brown. When the structures break, masses of fine, dark spores are released. Slime molds often appear suddenly.


","Slime molds will disappear if left alone. If desired, break up spore masses by vigorously raking.

","Some fungicides are registered but are not needed.


",
Lawn and Turf,Stripe Smut,"A fungus, Ustilago striiformis, overwinters as mycelium in diseased plants and spores in infested soil. Spores can germinate and attack lateral buds on crowns and rhizomes. Once the smut penetrates, it usually spreads through the entire plant. Many grass species are susceptible.


","Plants are most noticeably infected during cool spring and fall weather when they appear pale green to yellow or brown. Leaf symptoms first appear as narrow, yellow-green leaf streaks. They later become gray and eventually black when the epidermis ruptures, exposing masses of spores.


","

1) Plant treated seed or use pathogen-free sod or resistant cultivars.

2) Adopt a fertilization and watering schedule that is on the low side of optimum.

","Tolerant strains of many fungal pathogens can become troublesome when these fungicides are used exclusively in a spray schedule. To prevent developing resistant fungi, alternate or tank-mix materials from different groups with different modes of action.

Lawn and Turf,Take-all Patch,"Gaeumannomyces graminis var. graminis (formerly Ophiobolus graminis), a fungus that overwinters on turf debris and in the perennial portions of the grass plants. It is a wet-weather disease, spreading from plant to plant by growing over roots, rhizomes, and other plant parts and by adhering to equipment. In Oregon, it probably has been diagnosed incorrectly as the fairy-ring disease in many instances.
The disease is common in bentgrass and most severe on bentgrass growing in sandy soils under high fertility in stands 1 to 4 years old; incidence declines after 5 years. The disease also can be on other turf grasses. Weeds and annual bluegrass frequently invade the center of the circle where turfgrass has been killed. G. graminis is also an important pathogen of wheat, oats, barley, and rye.


","Areas are reddish brown at first, later brown to gray, usually circular, and 2 to 36 inches or larger in diameter. Both shoots and roots are killed. Patches may coalesce to form large areas of dead or declining turf.


","

1) Plant bentgrass in mixtures with fine fescues and perennial ryegrass, which are less susceptible to the disease.

2) Maintain soil pH below 5.5.

3) Maintain balanced nutrition. For established turf, use a balanced N-P-K ratio such as 6-1-4.

4) Spray with wettable sulfur, two (2) applications of 1.25 lb/1000 sq ft, 1 month apart in early spring. 24-hr reentry. On putting turf, use no more than 0.5 lb/1000 sq ft per application. Split applications (fall and spring).

Lawn and Turf-Typhula Blight ,(Gray Snow Mold),"Typhula incarnata and T. ishikariensis, fungi that grow and attack dormant plants at low temperatures under snow cover. Typhula incarnata is ""Gray Snow Mold"" and needs 60+ days of snow cover and T. ishikariensis is ""Speckled Snow Mold"" and needs less than 60 days of snow cover and in some cases, fog and light rain can promote disease development. They can survive the hot dry summer months as sclerotia (a compact mass of hardened mycelium stored with food reserves). In fall, they germinate under cool, moist conditions. Snow cover will predispose plants to attack by these fungi and the disease is worse the longer snow is on the ground. These fungi are most active under snow that has fallen on unfrozen ground. This is especially true for grass cut high and for short-cut golf course turf such as greens and tees. Snow is not necessarily needed for damage to occur from these fungi. Disease is worse on lawns with heavy thatch layer.


","After snow recedes, the disease appears as small (3 to 6 inches), roughly circular, water-soaked spots turning yellow to yellow-brown. Under prolonged snow, spots often are larger (up to 12 inches); they are white to gray-white and covered with a fluffy white to gray mass of fungal growth. Under favorable conditions, spots may enlarge with a gray halo of fungal growth on the margin. Generally only leaves, not crowns, are attacked; plants grow back to a normal appearance. However, in severe conditions, crowns may not regrow.


","

1) Use a balanced fertilizer; avoid heavy nitrogen applications in late fall. Use no more than 0.5 lb nitrogen/1000 sq ft per application. Ammonium nitrate or ammonium sulfate are recommended nitrogen sources for fall applications.

2) Improve air and soil drainage and reduce thatch by aerifying.

3) Rake and remove tree leaves from lawn before snowfall.

4) Continue to cut grass until snowfall and remove clippings.

","Both Microdochium patch and Typhula snow mold may be in the same area at the same time and often intermingle. When spraying, add a fungicide to control Microdochium and apply before snowfall. Applying fungicides too early may be followed by continued plant growth and/or rainfall. These conditions may dilute the fungicide and result in poor control.

Lawn and Turf,Yellow Patch,"The fungus Ceratobasidium cereale (formerly Rhizoctonia cerealis). The disease also is often referred to as cool-season Rhizoctonia. Because it is active at relatively cool temperatures, it is likely to be more common in the Pacific Northwest than brown patch (R. solani). Prolonged periods of leaf wetness, poor drainage, thatch accumulation, cloudy weather, and overfertilization favor disease development.

Leek ,(Allium porrum)-Iris Yellow Spot,"Iris yellow spot virus (IYSV) is new to leek production in the Pacific Northwest, first confirmed on leek seed crops during 2006 in the Willamette Valley. This virus is known to infect other members of the Allium group, including onion and garlic. A number of weeds and ornamentals may also be infected by IYSV.
This virus is transmitted by onion thrips (Thrips tabaci) but has not been shown to be transmitted by other thrips species. Recently it has been found in Colorado that onion transplants can be infected with IYSV as well as carry high populations of onion thrips. Studies have not shown this virus to be transmitted by seed.


","Affected leek seed crop plants have yellowish or tan diamond-shaped or irregularly-shaped lesions on flower stalks. Necrotic areas develop on leaves, and can be elongated brown lesions or brown flecks that resemble thrips injury.


","

1) Promote a healthy vigorous crop and avoid stress. Practice good fertility and water management.

2) Control volunteer and wild alliums.

3) Plant as densely and uniformly as possible.

Optimum temperatures for infection are 68°F to 72°F, but infection can occur between 50°F and 86°F. Spores are produced on foliar lesions and can spread by splashing water, Romaine and head lettuce types are more susceptible to the disease than green leaf, bibb, or red leaf types, but all lettuce cultivars as well as several Lactuca weed species are affected.


","Small, circular watersoaked lesions appear first on lower leaves, enlarge to become more elliptical, and turn brown. The centers often fall out, leaving black-margined holes in the leaf (shothole). Spots progress from older leaves to inner, younger leaves. Outer leaves often break off.


","

1) Reduce crop refuse. Plow and cultivate lettuce parts deeply into soil.

2) Sanitation measures for greenhouses.

2.1) Treat benches and seedling trays with a dilute bleach solution.
2.2) Remove and destroy infected seedlings promptly.
2.3) Sterilize soil with steam, if available.
3) Practice crop rotation, ensuring that fields are out of lettuce production for 4 to 5 years.

4) Avoid cultivating in wet weather.

5) Prevent moving infested soil to lettuce fields by washing equipment between fields.

6) If infections are few, remove affected plants and any old, dead leaves as soon as spots are visible.

Lettuce ,(Lactuca sativa)-Big Vein,"This viral disease is soilborne and transmitted by the oomycete, Olpidium virulentus (formerly known as O. brassicae). Mirafiori lettuce big-vein virus (MLBVV) (formerly known as Mirafiori lettuce virus)  has been recently identified as a causal agent of big vein while Lettuce big-vein associated virus (LBVaV) (formerly known as Lettuce big-vein virus), previously thought to cause big vein, is yet to be confirmed as a causal agent. Both viruses are commonly associated with big vein affected lettuce plants so both may play a role. Wet, cool conditions favor the fungus-like vector, which has a very wide host range. The virus can survive at least eight years in soil within resting sporangia. Uninfected vector strains acquire the virus upon entry in infected plants. New plantings may develop the disease due to weedy hosts acting as reservoirs of the vector and/or virus, including sow thistle (Sonchus oleraceus) and perhaps Chenopodium spp. Various species of Lactuca as well as Chicorium endivia (endive) are affected by big vein. Both MLBVV and LBVaV were detected in leaves of lettuce, garland chrysanthemum (Chrysanthemum coronarium), tomato, and eggplant while MLBVV has been reported in cucumber, and LBVaV in onion, Welsh onion (A. fistulosum), and Chinese chive (A. tuberosum).


","Leaf veins appear decidedly larger because of clear areas along the veins. Leaves may be puckered and mottled. Heads fail to size up. Often only a rosette of leaves forms, but no head. Low temperatures favor the disease; it is evident in early and late crops much more than in midsummer crops.


","

1) On badly infested land, use long rotations.

2) Avoid early planting in wet soil or poorly draining fields with a history of disease.

3) Select land not previously planted to lettuce, if possible.

4) Removing crop residue, rather than working it into the soil, prevents increase of the disease.

5) Steam treatment of soil for seedbeds or in the greenhouse will reduce the population of vector and virus.

Lettuce ,(Lactuca sativa)-Drop (Sclerotinia Rot),"Two fungi, Sclerotinia sclerotiorum and S. minor, that overwinter on lettuce refuse on the ground and as sclerotia in soil. There are two phases: the damping-off phase, which attacks seedlings; and the important field phase called ""drop"", which causes a watery soft rot. It is severe whenever lettuce is grown under cool, moist conditions. Sclerotia of S. minor are small (2 to 3 mm) compared to S. sclerotiorum (20 to 30 mm). S. minor is not a problem in Oregon. Many vegetable and field crops are susceptible to S. sclerotiorum, including potato and snap bean.


","Under moist conditions, outer leaves wilt, and there is a slimy rot of the plant. A cottony fungus growth appears on the stem near the soil level. Then the drop phase appears in midsummer or later after leaves wilt; it begins with the oldest leaves and continues until the plant collapses. Hard sclerotia develop throughout the diseased portion of the plant.


","

1) Use well-drained land and avoid crowding plants in the field.

2) Remove and destroy old plant trash from previous crops if possible. Do not dump the trash at the field's edge-inoculum can blow back into the field.

3) Corn, cereals, grasses, onions, table beets, and spinach are not susceptible and make good rotation crops in some situations.

4) In irrigated or wet coastal areas, flooding the soil when the ground is not in production helps reduce sclerotial survival, particularly of .

5) can be controlled economically by removing infected plants from the field promptly before leaves start to drop off. However, that is not feasible for .

Lettuce ,(Lactuca sativa)-Gray Mold,"Botrytis cinerea, (teleomorph: Botryotinia fuckeliana), a fungus that is pathogenic on many plants. This organism can survive on many hosts or on plant debris. It is an opportunistic pathogen and its spores (conidia) easily invade weak, damaged, or senescing tissue when wet. Conidia are produced throughout the growing season under a wide range of temperatures and humidity but cool temperatures, high humidity, and free water on plant surfaces favor the disease, as do close plant spacing and irrigation practices that keep plants wet for a long time. Downy mildew infection of leaves or Pythium infection of lower leaves or stems will make tissues susceptible to gray mold.


","The initial symptom is a dark, water-soaked lesion. A soft rot of infected leaves and stems occur as the pathogen grows into healthy tissues. Seedlings will fall over if infection girdles the stem. Any time before harvest, leaves may wilt, beginning with the oldest leaves and continuing until the plant collapses. Gray, powdery spore masses form, particularly on shaded leaves. Black sclerotia may also develop.


","

1) Avoid injury to plant tissues.

2) Limit irrigation so plant leaves do not remain wet; avoid overhead irrigation.

3) Control other pathogens that infect leaves or lower stem tissues.

4) Minimize crop debris/residues at planting.

Lettuce ,(Lactuca sativa)-Mosaic,"Lettuce mosaic virus, which is transmitted by seed and by the green peach aphid.


","In young plants, first the seedling leaves roll up on the long axis and the first true leaf is irregularly shaped and slightly lobed. Vein clearing and bronzing follow. Bronzing is caused by necrotic flecking of the leaf blade, especially along the veinlets. Symptom expression varies with variety and climatic factors.
In older plants, the mottle symptom is absent or indistinct. In half-grown plants, the whole plant is severely stunted and dull green to slightly yellow. The outer leaf tip rolls down, so plants look wilted although leaves may be turgid. Midribs on stunted plants protrude abnormally on the leaf underside and give the lower portion of the heads a ribby appearance.


","

1) Pathogen-free seed is the best means of control.

2) Avoid planting cultivars not tested for mosaic in the same field with tested material.

3) Control weeds, particularly wild lettuce, near the planting.

4) Remove diseased plants whenever apparent.

Lettuce ,(Lactuca sativa)-Red Rib (Rib Blight),"Unknown but believed to be physiological. Tests have not associated red rib with soil types, pH, or fertilizing practices.


","Brownish-red spots on leaves, mainly on ribs, enlarge to become fairly wide bands, up to 0.75 by 3 to 4 inches long. The bands are diffuse, not sharply edged. The disorder may affect one or two ribs of the outside leaves, but often the discoloration continues through to inner leaves from these points. Larger bands of affected tissue may crack, allowing rot organisms to enter.


","The variety 'Salinas' and other salinas types are susceptible. 'Ithaca' and 'Summertime' do not crack and rot.

",,
Lettuce ,(Lactuca sativa)-Tipburn,"Physiological disorder. All cultivars grown in the Pacific Northwest are susceptible to some degree, but they differ considerably. Under Oregon conditions, all California cultivars are susceptible. At least five environmental conditions-all of which affect the plant's calcium uptake or distribution-reportedly favor development of the disorder. (1) High relative humidity with high temperatures, particularly nights above 65°F during head development. (2) Conditions that favor rapid succulent growth such as an abundance of moisture and plant nutrients. (3) An inadequate or fluctuating water supply as the crop matures. (4) Low soil and air temperatures during early development followed by a period of high temperatures with low humidity as the crop nears maturity. (5) An imbalance in the mineral nutrition of the crop, particularly as affecting calcium. Excessively high levels of potassium and magnesium or high applications of ammonium nitrogen have been reported to predispose lettuce to tip burn, particularly if soils are low in calcium to begin with.


","Initial symptoms are small, dark brown spots along the margins of interior or exterior head leaves. Spots later merge together, and the entire margin becomes brown and necrotic. Tip burn is more serious on the internal leaves of the head because harvest crews cannot detect and eliminate the heads as unmarketable. The internal necrotic areas are ideal sites for the development of secondary rot organisms. Usually only a few leaves of the head are affected with tip burn.


","Calcium chloride treatments had some disease-reducing effect in test plots but not in field plots.

1) Use the more resistant cultivars: Ithaca and Summertime are recommended for main-season production.

2) It is important to maintain adequate calcium levels in soil and to manage fertilizer and irrigation programs to provide even growth throughout the plant's life. Soil samples should show adequate base saturation and adequate levels of calcium.

3) Nitrogen forms may be important; nitrate forms are preferred to ammonium forms.

4) Harvest lettuce at optimum maturity because tip burn tends to be more serious on overmature lettuce.

Lettuce ,(Lactuca sativa)-Varnish Spot,"A bacterium, Pseudomonas cichorii, which can survive in soil for some time after the lettuce crop is removed.


","Dark-brown, firm, necrotic spots a few millimeters in diameter occur on leaves and petioles of lettuce several layers within the lettuce head. Because outer layers of leaves are rarely affected, usually it is impossible to detect the disease without destroying the head.

1) Several years of crop rotation to non-hosts.

2) Minimizing overhead irrigation the 3 weeks before harvest may help.

Lettuce ,(Lactuca sativa)-Virescence (Aster Yellows),"The aster yellows phytoplasma is transmitted by several leafhoppers and has a very wide host range.


","First symptoms are blanching and chlorosis in young heart leaves. Center leaves fail to develop normally and may appear as short, thickened stubs. Pink to tan latex deposits collect on affected leaves. In plants infected late in the season, the only symptoms are latex deposits within the head. In general, infected plants are stunted, fail to head, and are worthless for market.

2) Controlling leafhopper vectors may give partial control.

3) Leafhoppers avoid shaded plants.

Lettuce ,(Lactuca sativa)-Yellows (Beet Western Yellows),"Beet western yellows virus is an increasingly significant pathogen in western Oregon. The principal vector is the green peach aphid, Myzus persicae, although other aphid vectors are likely. After acquiring the virus from infected plants, aphids may retain for life the ability to transmit virus. An enormous number of crop and weed species are susceptible to the virus; thus the natural inoculum reservoir is hardly avoidable. Crops commonly infected in western Oregon include beets (table and sugar), broccoli, most clovers, mustard, lettuce, pea, radish, spinach, Swiss chard, and turnip. Weed species commonly infected in western Oregon include burdock, Canada thistle, cutleaf geranium, dog fennel, groundsel, pigweed, redstem filaree, clovers, and wild mustard.


","Leaves turn yellow prematurely, typically beginning at the margins and progressing in; veins and midribs tend to remain green. The oldest leaves tend to yellow first. Yellows symptoms progress up, resulting in reduced and abnormal growth.

Leucothoe,Powdery Mildew,"The fungus Erysiphe azaleae (formerly Oidium ericinum) has been found in Washington. Powdery mildew on this host is common in west-side locations in Oregon and Washington. Wind blows conidia to healthy foliage where they start new mildew colonies. The fungus does not grow in a leaf but rather across the surface. Small anchor cells of the fungus, haustoria, remain in the leaf and take nourishment from the plant, but the main filament and the spores it produces are outside the leaf. The disease can develop under relatively dry conditions in spring and summer so long as the air is humid. Plants in shade tend to have more problems because that environment favors disease development. Multiple disease cycles occur during the growing season.


","Leaves may show pale, yellow-green, irregularly shaped blotches. These areas enlarge to about 0.5 inch and turn reddish-purple. Close observation reveals sparse whitish or tan fungal mycelium on the leaf undersurface, growing in association with the spots. Heavy infection may lead to defoliation.


","

2) Rake up and destroy fallen leaves.

3) Plant in an area with good air circulation and morning sun.

4) Avoid humid planting sites.

Lilac ,(Syringa spp.)-Bacterial Blight,"Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae, the bacterium that also causes bacterial blight of pear, blueberry, cherry, maple, and many other woody plants. Bacteria overwinter on diseased twigs or as epiphytes on healthy wood. Factors that weaken or injure plants predispose them to disease. Such factors include wounds, both accidental and from pruning or budding, frost damage, incorrect soil pH, poor or improper nutrition, and infection by other pathogens.
Bacterial sources can include old cankers, healthy buds, low populations within plants (with or without cankers), leaf surfaces, nearby weeds and grasses, even soil. Bacteria spread by wind, rain, insects, tools, and infected nursery stock. Mild, moist weather favors disease development.
Two common genetic traits increase the bacteria's ability to cause disease. Most produce a powerful plant toxin, syringomycin, which destroys plant tissues as bacteria multiply in a wound. Bacteria also produce a protein that acts as an ice nucleus, increasing frost wounds that bacteria easily colonize and expand.
Some species of Syringa have shown resistance in western Washington including S. josikaea, S. Komarowii, S. microphylla, S. pekinensis, and S. reflexa. Most cultivars of S. vulgaris are susceptible, but some have been observed with less disease when planted in a garden; those cultivars include Edith Cavell, Glory, Ludwig Spaeth, and Pink Elizabeth. Note that 'Ludwig Spaeth' is highly susceptible under intense nursery production systems.


","The disease starts as brown spots on stems and leaves of young shoots as they develop in early spring. A yellow halo may also be around the spot. Spots become black and grow rapidly, especially during rainy periods. Further infectious development depends on the age of the part attacked.
On young stems, infection spreads around the stem and girdles it so the shoot bends over at the lesion and the parts above it wither and die. On mature stems, spots usually enlarge along the stem, causing leaf death only within the infected area.
Young, infected leaves blacken rapidly starting near the margin and continuing in a wedge-shaped pattern down to the petiole. Eventually the entire leaf dies. On older leaves, spots enlarge slowly. Sometimes, several spots will run together, and the leaf may crinkle at the edge or along the midvein. Flower clusters also may be infected and rapidly become blighted and blackened.
Buds may fail to open or may turn black and die shortly after opening. Symptoms are similar to those of winter injury.

1) Maintain adequate spacing between plants and prune to provide good air circulation within the canopy.

2) Prune out and burn all affected tissues immediately.

3) Plant resistant species or cultivars.

4) Do not fertilize late in the growing season. Do not overfertilize young plants.

Lilac ,(Syringa spp.)-Lilac Ring Mottle,"Lilac ring mottle virus can be mechanically transmitted from one plant to another.


","Leaf deformation, reduction in leaf size, ring spots, and line patterns were observed on cultivars President Grevy and Krasavitsa Moskvy. Symptom expression was influenced by environmental conditions and may be erratic, thus infections may remain undetected for years.
Note: There are variegated cultivars such as S. v. 'Aucubaefolia' that look like they are infected with a virus.


","

1) Infected plants should be removed and destroyed.

2) Sanitize pruning and other tools between plants or blocks of plants. Use two tools so a worker can trim or cut with one while the other soaks. When done with a batch, cultivar, etc. switch one tool for the other and allow the used one to soak.

3) Sanitation should also be practiced when taking cuttings for propagation.

Lilac ,(Syringa spp.)-Powdery Mildew,"Erysiphe syringae (formerly Microsphaera syringae) and Phyllactinia syringae, fungi. Cultivars of S. vulgaris are very susceptible, but other species can be resistant. Conidia are released in response to abrupt decreases in relative humidity. Wind blows conidia to healthy foliage where they start new mildew colonies. Too much water, such as flowing water or rain, destroys spores by causing them to burst. The fungus does not grow in a leaf but rather across the surface. Small anchor cells of the fungus, haustoria, remain in the leaf and take nourishment from the plant, but the main filament and the multitudes of spores it produces are outside the leaf. The disease can develop under relatively dry conditions in spring and summer so long as the air is humid. Plants in shade tend to have more problems because that environment favors disease development. Multiple disease cycles occur during the growing season.
The following species and cultivars were found to be resistant to both powdery mildew and bacterial blight in Tennessee: Syringa josiflexa 'Royalty', S. patula 'Miss Kim', S. prestoniae 'Donald Wyman', and S. vulgaris 'Sensation'.


","A grayish-white fungus develops at first in patches but then extensively on leaves. Generally the disease does not appear until the latter part of the growing season and so does little damage.

Lilac ,(Syringa spp.)-Root Rot,"There are several organisms that have been associated with root rots of lilac including Phytophthora, Rhizoctonia and Armillaria. These diseases are generally found where plants are in cold wet soils and/or overwatered. Young, nursery-grown plants can get root rot as well as mature bushes grown in landscapes.


","Plants infected by Phytophthora may show decline and dieback of one to many shoots and branches. Leaves may turn chlorotic before becoming necrotic and may not fall from dead plants. A reddish-brown discoloration can be found in the root crown of plants. There may be a line between discolored and healthy tissue.
Armillaria mycelial fans can be observed beneath the bark of the root crown of infected plants. Mycelial fans are thick, white layers of fungus that adhere to the inner root bark and/or the wood beneath the bark. Armillaria also makes black, shoestring-like structures called rhizomorphs, which are occasionally found within the bark and/or extending into surrounding soil.


","

1) Do not overwater plants.

2) Provide good drainage for plants in beds, fields, or containers. Place containers on gravel beds (4 inches or more deep) to allow drainage. Do not place containers on poly sheets; they can prevent containers from draining into soil and allow contaminated drainage water to spread from the base of one container to another.

3) Avoid reusing pots from a previous crop for propagation. If pots must be reused then wash off all debris and soak in a sanitizing solution or treat with aerated steam for 30 min.

Lily ,(Lilium spp.)-Basal Rot (Bulb Rot),"Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. lilii, a fungus. The fungus is carried on bulbs and can survive in soil indefinitely. The disease usually comes into a planting on infected lily bulbs. If a lily plant yellows during the current season, the usual cause is Fusarium bulb rot. Initial infection occurs just behind the root cap. Conidia germinate within 6 hours and within 48 hours spread through the intercellular spaces between the epidermis and the outermost cells of the root cortex. Direction infection of scales may also occur through stomata in the epidermis. Unlike other many other Fusarium diseases this is not a vascular wilt but a rot of the cortical tissues of the root. Fusarium bulb rots are more common during the winter when soils can be excessively wet. The disease also occurs often as a combination with Cylindrocarpon, other Fusarium spp. and other fungi.


","This disease results in a severe root rot and destruction of the basal plate. Chocolate or bluish-gray rot that extends from the basal plate into the scales. The surface of rotting scales remains smooth until disintegration begins. Scales detach at the basal plate, and bulbs often fall to pieces after digging. Aboveground symptoms are general to many belowground diseases and include premature yellowing of the foliage, stunting, and premature senescence. Flower buds may wilt and fail to open.


","

1) Destroy bulbs with chocolate-color rot at base of scales.

2) Propagate from rot-free scales.

3) If disease is in a lily bed, dig bulbs and destroy all rotted ones.

4) Improve soil drainage.

5) Use low-nitrogen fertilizers.

6) Remove remnants of bulbs and plant debris.

7) The Asiatic lilies 'Connecticut King' and 'Mont Blanc' have shown resistance when grown in the field in the Netherlands.

Lily ,(Lilium spp.)-Botrytis Blight (Fire),"Botrytis elliptica and B. cinerea, fungi. The former has been reported on crocus, daylily, and gladiolus but is primarily on lily while the later has a huge host range. Botrytis overwinters as sclerotia in the debris of plant shoots that mature and decay in fall. In spring, sclerotia on or near the soil surface produce conidia that infect leaves. Conidia are windblown to healthy foliage. Infection is most likely in wet foggy weather where plants are wet for 6 to 12 hours and when temperatures range from 50°F to 65°F during day or night. Infection by B. elliptica is through stomata on the underside of leaves. Spore production in diseased tissue spreads the fungus during the growing season. Under optimal conditions many spots may occur at once throughout the planting. Colonized flower parts that fall onto leaves or stems can be the source of mycelium that directly infects healthy tissues. Injuries due to hail can also favor disease development. The disease can reduce bulb growth as well as making cut flowers or pot grown plants unmarketable. Cultivars are known to differ in susceptibility.


","Typical initial symptoms are water-soaked (wet-looking), teardrop- or boat-shape brown spots that occur anywhere on the leaf. Spot color varies with leaf texture and the lily species affected, but usually the center is a different color and slightly sunken. Yellow streaks are often associated with these spots. As the spots increase in size the foliage is killed and hangs down. Disease severity is generally greatest on the lower leaves. Flowers develop tan-to-brown spreading spots on buds and petals. Dead tissue may be covered with the fuzzy gray growth and sporulation of the fungus during moist periods.


","

1) Remove all plant debris at season's end. Preferably, pull shoots as soon as they can be pulled away easily from bulbs.

2) Removing flower buds early helps manage disease.

3) Annual digging.

4) Reduce planting densities to promote good air circulation.

5) Avoid overhead irrigation or any practice that keeps plants wet for extended periods of time. Individual drip watering of pots can also help.

6) Rotate planting sites to new ground each year.

","Best used with cultural controls. Spray at the first signs of infection. Fungicide coverage of the lower leaf surface is important to obtain the best disease control.

Lily ,(Lilium spp.)-Crown Rot,,,,,
Lily ,"(Lilium spp.)-Nematode, Foliar","Aphelenchoides fragariae has a wide host range (including Anemone, begonia, and phlox) and is a pest of various kinds of lily in northern and southwestern Oregon. Nematode infections are transferred to other areas and from one season to the next in planting stock. Plant-to-plant spread in field and greenhouse plantings occurs especially when plants are close together. Spread can be rapid even when low-volume irrigation spray stakes are used in the greenhouse. Foliar nematodes generally are in the plant's buds and leaves but may be in soil as well. They can survive in the soil alone for 3 months or longer in plant tissue. The life cycle can be completed in 10 to 13 days and they are rapid swimmers.


","Bunchy-top and dieback conditions are symptoms of foliar nematodes. Infected leaves are blotchy, then turn yellow or brown and wither back against the stem. Terminal leaves are distorted, thickened, and point up in various directions. Another common symptom is ""blossom blasting."" Easter lilies so affected in the field and greenhouse cultures are referred to as ""blind."" Nematodes thrive in young flower buds, often injuring them so that blooming is retarded or the flowers destroyed. Infected plants show more than one symptom at a time.
Bunchy-top, dieback, and blossom blasting are common symptoms of many infected Easter and other garden lilies. A notable exception is the Rubrum lily. Infected leaves show purplish areas before turning brown and wilting back to the stem. Symptoms usually appear in late summer in all garden lilies except Easter lilies, in which they appear in late spring. Infection from this nematode moves along the row, seldom causing a target-spot pattern.


","

1) Roguing lily planting for foliar nematodes is common practice. It is difficult to detect infection at an early stage, so roguing must be repeated several times during the season.

2) Infected bulblets are treated successfully in a hot water bath of 111°F (43.5°C) for 1 hour. Treatment is best on bulblets only, reducing the volume of treated material and avoiding plant injury, which often follows treatment of larger bulbs. After treatment, soak bulbs in fungicide to protect against rot.

3) Avoid overhead irrigation or any practice that keeps plants wet for extended periods of time or splashes water from one plant onto another.

4) Remove and destroy all plant debris at season's end.

","These nematodes are also sensitive to organophosphate insecticides. Check the PNW Insect Management Handbook for current registrations and/or warnings on phytotoxicities.

",
Lily ,"(Lilium spp.)-Nematode, Root-lesion","Pratylenchus penetrans and P. crenatus. P. penetrans is much more important because of its general distribution and wide host range. Distribution usually is by infected planting stock. Root-lesion nematodes are migratory endoparasites; part of the population is in soil and part in the roots at all times. Generally more damage at lower population levels in sandy soils. The complete life cycle can take from 30 to 86 days depending on temperature. Adults as well as J2, J3, and J4 can all invade roots, usually in the region of root elongation. They feed upon the cells in the root cortex. Sections of cells are killed as well as small roots. Roots generally rot due to secondary colonization by many other organisms such as fungi. Management of these nematodes is difficult with crop rotation as they have a wide host range and are supported by pasture grasses commonly used after harvest.


","Foliage that prematurely yellows from the bottom and plants that mature early in circular areas of a field usually indicate nematode damage. Infected areas may be difficult to find in an unusually wet season. Roots are greatly reduced, and most show dark lesions or dead spots. Infected plants may retain only a few stubby root remnants, the remainder having sloughed off. If plants are severely infected, bulbs have no roots left. Because infected plants are damaged and mature early, bulb size is greatly reduced.


","Not effective alone.

1) Pruning bulbs' roots eliminates 75% to 80% of the nematodes.

2) Recently harvested, infected bulblets are treated in a hot water bath of 111°F (43.5°C) for 1 hour. Treatment is best on bulblets only, reducing the volume of treated material, and avoiding plant injury, which often follows treatment of larger bulbs. After treatment, store bulbs at 28°F for 2 months before planting again.

3) Sowing marigolds directly after harvest may help reduce nematode populations in the soil.

","A combination of preplant soil fumigation followed with a nematicide at planting is necessary to manage these nematodes in southwest Oregon.

Lily ,(Lilium spp.)-Root Rots,"The fungi Fusarium oxysporum, F. tricinctum, Trichoderma spp. and a Rhizoctonia sp. (Ceartobasidium sp.) isolated from PNW grown bulbs were found to cause a necrosis and root rot when inoculated individually onto potted plants. Symptom development was more rapid with prior exposure to root lesion nematodes. Root rots caused by Pythium ultimum, Cylindrocarpon sp., Fusarium oxysporum, and Rhizoctonia solani are the major disease problems during the forcing of lilies. P. irregulare has been found more frequently in the Northeastern United States. These pathogens often form a root rot complex together. Fusarium bulb rots are more common during the winter when soils can be excessively wet, and Pythium root rot is more common under warm, moist conditions.


","General symptoms associated with root rot consist of a general loss of quality, stunted growth, and the premature yellowing and senescence of lower leaves on the plants. Underground symptoms include rotted portions on roots and bulbs. Root rots can also lead to an increase in the postharvest senescence of leaves, especially when plants are placed in cold storage prior to shipping.

Lily ,(Lilium spp.)-Virus Diseases,"There are more than 11 viruses that can be a problem on lily. Lily symptomless virus (LSV), Lily mottle virus (LMV),stripe, Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV), and Tulip breaking virus (streak disease) are common problems. Aphid vectors are effective carriers of each of these viruses and CMV can also be mechanically transmitted. Fleck can occur when both LSV and CMV are in the lily at the same time.


","LSV-mild mottle, severe mottle, basal striping, and twisting can occur on leaves. Disease symptoms vary with lily cultivar, clone, and environment. Plants are shorter and take longer to flower when concentrations of the virus are higher.
LMV - Vein clearing, leaf mottle, leaf mosaic, chlorotic and yellow streaking, leaf curling and narrowing have all been associated with this virus. Some cultivars show flower color break.
CMV - Light-green mosaic that often evolves to a gray or brownish necrotic spot. Leaves become brittle and flowers are malformed.
Fleck-white or yellowish fleck spots become apparent in affected plants' leaves. Spots are barely noticeable in the youngest leaves but conspicuous in older ones. As the disease progresses, the leaves tend to twist; plants are stunted and, if they bloom, produce flowers that are worthless.
Streak-typical streak plants are stunted, darker than normal green, and conspicuously streaked with white fleck spots that may extend several inches along the veins. Streak differs from typical fleck in that the fleck spots form long streaks, and affected plants usually die within a year.


","

1) Plant only the healthiest scales available. Stock that has been tested and found free of all known viruses is most desirable. Lily seed is virus-free.

2) When plants are in the asparagus stage, about 4 inches tall, and when leaves first fold out, examine them for mosaic viruses. Fleck diseases are unlikely to be noticed until plants are older.

3) Rogue out and destroy affected plants.

4) Disinfect cutting knives and other tools frequently by soaking 60 sec in 10% bleach (Clorox), or shellac thinner (70% ethyl alcohol), or quaternary ammonium (Physan 20).

5) If breeding lilies or if growing seedlings to escape viruses, cage or otherwise protect seedlings from aphids. One winged aphid can infect several plants with certain viruses. Unfortunately, most virus diseases are undetectable in lily seedlings before the second or third season of growth, which makes protecting the seedlings imperative.

6) Control aphid vectors. See the  for details.

Linden ,(Tilia spp.)-Leaf Scorch,"Drought, heat stress, and excess sunlight may cause leaf scorch. In general, there is not enough water reaching the leaf margin to keep up with transpiration. An interruption of the vascular system, as with cankers, can also produce these symptoms. Salt damage may occur on plants growing near sidewalks due to winter use of de-icing products or from overfertilization. Some lindens including Tilia americana (American linden or American basswood) are reported to be intolerant of air pollution and may develop marginal leaf necrosis or other leaf damage if exposed to high levels of pollution.


","Leaf margins and areas between veins turn brown. Twig dieback may follow.


","

1) When irrigating, wet the entire root zone infrequently during the summer. Avoid over-watering.

2) Provide good drainage and avoid soil compaction.

3) Use a layer of organic mulch over the root zone to retain soil moisture and to moderate soil temperatures.

4) To avoid reflected heat, do not plant close to buildings or paved surfaces, and avoid rock and black plastic mulches.

5) Avoid root and trunk injury.

6) Do not overfertilize.

Lingonberry ,(Vaccinium vitis-idaea)-Diseases,"There are very few reports of problems on this plant, most likely due to little interest rather than to lack of problems. The OSU Plant Clinic has had three samples from the 1950s to the 1990s. One was diagnosed with frost damage; the two others had Phytophthora root rot. Growers in Oregon have mentioned a twig dieback. Rust has been found in Vermont and a shoot gall in Alaska. Reports from Europe indicate a pH of 4 to 4.5 is needed and that the crop does not do well under high nitrogen. Under high nitrogen, plants had dieback that resembled fungal problems, and in some cases the plants died. It is unclear whether the high nitrogen was related to high soluble salts in the root zone or to increased susceptibility to winter injury, both of which could result in the symptoms observed.

Lingonberry ,(Vaccinium vitis-idaea)-Leaf Spots and Twig Blights,"Various pathogenic fungi have been found in association with leaf spots and twig blights in Oregon. This includes Allantophomopsis lycopodina on the cultivars Erntesege, Erntekrone, and Koralle; Phomopsis columnaris on cv 'Koralle'; Phytophthora citricola and Coleophoma empetri on cv 'Red Pearl'; and Rhizoctonia sp. on cv 'Koralle'. Many of these fungi are favored by wet weather and survive on dead plant debris. Various weak or opportunistic pathogens are also associated with tissues injured by frost or on senescing tissue, including Pestalotiopsis and Volutella.


","Each of these fungi were found in plants with dark purple-black leaf spots, leaf blight, or twig dieback. Infection by Phomopsis columnaris eventually resulted in whole plant dieback of the cultivar Koralle. There were no distinctive characters that would allow a diagnosis to pathogen based only on symptoms alone. Laboratory confirmation is necessary to distinguish which pathogens may be present.


","No specific control tactics have been developed for these fungal problems. The following may help reduce disease pressure.

1) Remove and destroy dead plant debris.

Lithodora diffusa,Black Root Rot,"Thielaviopsis basicola is a widely distributed root pathogen reported from at least 30 plant families. Untreated or improperly treated field soil can be a source of T. basicola if used in potted-plant culture. Most soilless media are clean; however, T. basicola spores can be in commercial peat moss and result in disease problems. The pathogen forms thick-walled chlamydospores, which can survive several years in soil. Root exudates stimulate chlamydospores to germinate in soils whose pH ranges from 5 to 8.5, and root rot tends to be more serious in plants grown in neutral and alkaline soils. Root rot also generally is more serious for plants grown in soil at 55°F to 70°F but can be severe on some plants at as high as 77°F. Disease severity tends to be worse when temperatures are not optimal for the plant, and the soil moisture-holding capacity is 70% or above for extended periods.


","Plants often are chlorotic and stunted. Several scattered branches may dieback and resemble other disease problems. Initially, roots or portions of roots killed by this pathogen are brown. These root lesions then turn black because of the abundant formation of chlamydospores on the root surface and in the root cortex.


","Fungicides do not compensate for poor sanitation or environmental controls.

1) The disease is greatly reduced at pH levels below 5.5.

2) Use soilless planting media. If field soil is a component of the growing medium, treat it with steam (122°F for 30 min) or chemical fumigants.

3) Dispose of diseased plants and plant material promptly.

4) Do not let contaminated tools or hands contact sterilized planting media.

5) Keep entire propagation and growing areas clean.

6) After the production cycle, remove any remaining plants and disinfect the growing area.

","There are no fungicides specifically registered for this crop. However, several fungicides such as Banrot, Medallion, Terraguard and Thiophanate-methyl-based products may be effective if not phytotoxic to the plants. Fungicides work best when used as a protectant in combination with cultural controls. Chemical control may require multiple applications. If the disease is noticed early, also treat with fungicides. This disease can be difficult to control.

Lobelia,Damping-off,"Pythium spp. can cause damping-off and has been found on Lobelia by the OSU Plant Clinic. Pythium is favored by cool and overly moist soil conditions. It survives unfavorable periods in soil and infected plant debris. Under favorable conditions, spores germinate and infect roots. After infection, the fungus-like microorganism spreads mainly in the inner bark tissues of the root and stems. They survive as various spores in the soil, container media, or infected roots. Movement of infected plants and/or soil can spread the organism.


","Stems of seedlings or recent transplants collapse at the soil line and die. There may also be a soft, mushy rot of ungerminated seeds.

1) Plant in pasteurized, well-drained raised beds or in soilless media. Also disinfect any tools and equipment that might be used and contaminate the media.

2) Seeds should be planted when temperatures favor rapid germination and growth, so plants rapidly emerge and reach a more mature or hardened state.

3) Avoid reusing pots or trays from a previous crop for propagation. If pots must be reused then wash off all debris and soak in a sanitizing solution or treat with aerated steam for 30 min.

Lupine ,(Lupinus spp.)-Powdery Mildew,"Erysiphe polygoni, a fungus that has been reported from all PNW states. Can be prevalent in garden situations. This fungus has a wide host range including many vegetables and ornamentals but may be specialized to only one or a few hosts. It is favored by conditions that produce high humidity but dry leaves such as heavily-shaded growing sites. The fungus is a highly specialized pathogen that forms a close association with the host. Conditions that favor the host also favor the pathogen. Much of the fungus remains outside infected plant parts where it grows on the surface but sinks root-like structures called haustoria into plant cells to ob-tain nutrients. The white growth seen is composed of both mycelium and spores of the fungus. Cleistothesia are formed when isolates of different mating types occur on the same leaf. These fruiting bodies overwinter and release ascospores in the spring.


","White powdery spots that may quickly cover the entire leaf. Lesions may occur on widely scattered plants early in the season but can be almost uniform on heavily infected plants by late summer. Small black dots (cleistothesia) may be seen later in the white areas.

Madrone ,(Arbutus menziesii)-Canker,"Neofusicoccum arbuti (formerly Fusicoccum arbuti)(sexual form suspected to be Botryosphaeria sp.), a fungus that appears widespread on declining madrone throughout the west coast. Most infections occur through injuries from freezing, sunburn, or pruning cuts, but under ideal conditions the fungus can infect uninjured bark. All ages and sizes of madrones are affected with larger older madrones having the most mortality.


","Black or purplish areas develop in the bark of main trunks or major branches. Soon a canker develops in the discolored area. Eventually, dead bark sloughs off, leaving a sunken area surrounded by callus tissue. Wood in the cankered area is cracked longitudinally and dark masses of spores can be seen. Rapidly spreading cankers have smooth margins and no callus tissue. Cankers may spiral around, girdling and killing trunks and branches. Non-vigorous trees may decline rapidly and die in a year or two while more vigorous trees may persist for years with multiple cankers.


","

1) Avoid injuring or weakening trees, especially during construction operations.

2) Prune out and destroy cankered or dead branches. Prune about 1 foot below the cankered area.

3) Although madrone is drought tolerant, consider infrequent deep watering during extended drought periods. Do not focus waterings near the trunk.

4) Avoid pruning or removing surrounding trees that may be shading the trunk of madrones. Wrap trunks to prevent sunburn if this can not be avoided or remove trees in the fall or winter.

Madrone ,(Arbutus menziesii)-Leaf Spots and Blights,"More than a dozen fungal organisms can cause leaf spots and dead regions on madrone leaves, and the specific disease can be difficult to identify. For all these foliage diseases; however, airborne or water-splashed spores infect young leaves during wet weather, often in spring. Trees growing in creek bottoms, valleys, and the forest understory are most likely to be infected. Ruptoseptoria unedonis (formerly Mycosphaerella arbuticola), has been found by the OSU Plant Clinic. Tar spot, caused by Rhytisma arbuti has been reported from Washington. These diseases may result in unsightly foliage but seldom are serious alone.
Numerous madrone in the PNW experienced severe leaf blight during the winters 2009 and 2010. The fungus Phacidiopycnis washingtonensis has been isolated regularly from this blighted tissue and has been shown to colonize cold damaged leaf tissue. It can also infect leaves directly that have not been cold damaged.
Leaf spots generally increase on madrone leaves as the year progresses, especially during the winter in high rainfall areas. Leaves are naturally shed by the mid-summer over a year after they develop. Leaf spots are a problem if they cause defoliation before that time.


","Mycosphaerella-affected leaves have numerous small spots, 0.25 to 0.5 inch in diameter. On the upper leaf surface, spots are circular to irregular in shape, with grayish centers and distinct, purplish brown margins. On the lower leaf surface, spots are light brown with darker brown margins. Centers of spots may contain small black dots (pseudothecia), which are the spore-containing fruiting bodies of the fungus. Defoliation may occur.
Tar spot, produces irregularly shaped, black, tarlike spots on the undersides of leaves. Leaf tissue around the spots becomes yellowish.
Phacidiopycnis leaf blight - Necrotic spots anywhere on the leaf and blotches along edges and tips of leaves.

Maple ,(Acer macrophyllum)-Wood Decay,"Limb and/or trunk failure due to fungal wood decay is a common problem with old big leaf maples (Acer macrophyllum). Injuries from pruning cuts, sunburn, or storm damage can expose susceptible wood. Large wounds and stubs and horizontal cuts are often entry sites for decay fungi. Wood decay generally is observed in older trees after extensive fungal colonization. Decay fungi frequently function as secondary invaders following a succession of microorganisms, including bacteria, yeasts, and other fungi. Decay in a single tree may be caused by more than one fungal species.
Most fungi that cause extensive wood decay are Basidiomycetes. These fungi produce various fruiting bodies such as mushrooms and conks that contain basidia. These fruiting bodies develop after extensive colonization of the substrate in a suitable environment and under suitable physiological conditions. Basidiospores are forcibly discharged from basidia and usually are disseminated by air currents. Wood decay fungi enter trees primarily through wounds that expose sapwood or heartwood. Mycelial growth of the fungus proceeds with colonization and utilization of wood as a food source.
Two types of wood decay occur in living trees: white rots and brown rots. There are at least 6 different fungi causing white rots reported on big leaf maples from the PNW, including some familiar fungi such as Trametes versicolor. White rots cause all major structural components of the cell wall-cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin-to degrade. The strength of white rotted wood decreases only in advanced stages of decay.
Brown rots, with at least 3 fungi reported on big leaf maples from the PNW, cause most of the cell wall polysaccharides to degrade, but the lignin component is unchanged or slightly modified. The strength of brown rotted wood is significantly reduced or lost entirely shortly after decay begins. These rots usually are in exposed wood and can cause extensive damage, resulting in structural failure.
Some root rots, such as those caused by Armillaria sp. or Heterobasidion sp. can also extend up into the trunk and cause wood decay.


","White rots cause moist, soft, or spongy wood that is a lighter color than sound wood.
Brown rots of wood are brown, dry, and crumbly, with longitudinal and transverse cracks. These rots usually are in exposed wood and can cause extensive damage, resulting in structural failure.
Each of these wood decays leads to limb breakage and/or uprooted trees during wind or ice storms. Many trees have decreased vigor and dieback.


","

1) Help prevent wood decay by using cultural practices that promote tree growth and vigor while minimizing injuries that expose wood.

2) Irrigation water, especially from sprinklers, should not wet the trunks.

3) Mowing equipment should not injure the roots, crown, or lower trunk.

4) Make pruning cuts adjacent to, but not into, the supporting branch, and prune when branches are small to enhance callus formation and wound healing.

Maple ,(Acer spp.)-Armillaria Root Rot,,,,,
Maple ,(Acer spp.)-Bacterial Leaf Spot and Dieback,"Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae, the same bacterium that causes bacterial blight of lilac, fruit trees, and many woody ornamentals. It overwinters on infected plant parts or as an epiphyte on healthy tissue. It spreads with windblown rain, insects, and pruning tools. Bacteria enter through wounds or natural openings. Wound infection during budding may interfere with bud-take. Frost damage, high nitrogen fertilization (especially late summer), and heavy rains favor bacterial invasion. Most species, especially Acer rubrum, are susceptible except sugar maples. Most Japanese maple cultivars such as Sango Kaku and Oshi Beni are highly susceptible. Trees with Verticillium wilt may be more susceptible to symptom development.
Two common genetic traits increase the bacteria's ability to cause disease. Most produce a powerful plant toxin, syringomycin, which destroys plant tissues as bacteria multiply in a wound. Bacteria also produce a protein that acts as an ice nucleus, increasing frost wounds that bacteria easily colonize and expand.


","Symptoms include leaf spots, vein blackening, and tip dieback of Japanese, Norway, and red maples. Leaf spots vary from pinpoint size to 0.25 inch in diameter. Most leaf spots begin as a water-soaked area and may show a chlorotic halo. Spots may coalesce, destroying leaves or young seedlings.
Year-old twigs may turn black during the dormant season. These twigs then turn ash-gray with a black band of tissue near the advancing lesion. Buds can turn black and fail to break in spring, or shoots may leaf out and then die back. Twigs may continue to die back through spring as blackened tissue continues to expand toward the shoot's base.


","

1) Plant resistant cultivars or avoid highly susceptible cultivars.

2) Carefully handle young plants.

3) If possible, do all pruning and budding, or any practice that wounds plants, in dry weather.

4) Protect from rain and frost, if feasible, in early spring or late fall. Plastic shelters have been as good as or better than chemical methods against the same disease on other crops.

5) Remove and destroy dead and/or blackened twigs and fallen leaves.

6) Maintain adequate spacing for good air circulation.

7) Avoid high-nitrogen fertilization that produces a lot of late-season growth, which causes plants to be more sensitive to winter injury and thus more susceptible to bacteria.

","Must use with cultural controls. Many bacteria resistant to copper-containing products and to antibiotics have been detected in Pacific Northwest nurseries.

Maple ,(Acer spp.)-Bigleaf Maple Decline (Bigleaf Maple Dieback),"Unknown. Forest pathologists have been investigating a new decline and dieback of bigleaf maple that emerged in 2010. The problem is widespread throughout western Washington and Oregon and may extend into California. Many pathogens have been ruled out as the primary cause (but may be involved in secondary symptoms) including Armillaria, various oomycetes, Nectria cankers, stem decay fungi such as Ganoderma, and Verticillium. Testing for the bacterium Xylella fastidiosa has been negative. Abiotic factors, such as drought, are possible but none has emerged as the definitive cause.


","Crown, branch, and entire tree dieback with clumps of shrunken leaves in the canopy and heavy seed crops. Trees of many ages and sizes have died from this disease. Additional symptoms may include leaves with yellow edges and red-to-brown tips-typical leaf scorch.


","Maintain trees as best you can with minimal care and infrequent deep waterings during the summer months while forest pathologist scratch their heads.

",,
Maple ,(Acer spp.)-Branch Cankers,"The OSU Plant Clinic has found several fungi from maple branch cankers including Cytospora sp., Nectria spp., Phoma sp. and Phomopsis sp. The fungi Cytospora chrysosperma and Stegonsporium pyriforme have been reported from Washington and Idaho. Many of these fungal cankers occur through injuries from freezing, sunburn, drought, or pruning cuts, but under ideal conditions they can infect uninjured bark. It is suspected that trees with Verticillium wilt are more prone to canker development.
Several tree squirrels will strip the bark from late spring to early summer using the tender cambial layer for food and/or shredded bark for lining of nests.


","Cytospora - Portions of a twig or branch dieback in the spring or summer. Stems and branches develop elongate, shallow cankers where the bark in centers usually contains many small, gray-to-white, pimple-like reproductive bodies of the fungus. Symptoms may also be seen on small-diameter trunks.
Squirrel damage may show as sudden dying of whole branches where dead brown leaves remain attached for many months. Long stretches of bark may be seen removed from the lower portion of these branches. If the branch has been girdled then branches will die quickly. If the branch has not been girdled then distal leaves may wilt, have marginal burning, and/or symptoms of nutrient deficiency. Strands of bark may be seen hanging from the stripped areas.


","

1) Avoid injuring or weakening trees, especially during construction operations.

2) Prune out and destroy cankered or dead branches. Prune about 1-foot below the cankered area.

3) Infrequent deep watering during extended drought periods may be helpful. Do not focus waterings near the trunk.

4) Paint the southwest side of tree trunks with white latex paint to avoid winter injury.

Maple ,(Acer spp.)-Leaf Blister,"Taphrina darkeri, a fungus that may be locally epidemic, has been reported from Oregon on vine maple and Idaho on Rocky Mt. maple.


","Dark, irregular blisters appear on the upper surface of infected leaves. Spore production forms a white bloom on the affected tissues.


",,,
Maple ,(Acer spp.)-Leaf Scorch,"Drought or heat stress may cause leaf scorch. In general, there is not enough water reaching the leaf margin to keep up with transpiration. An interruption of the vascular system, as with cankers or squirrel damage, can also produce these symptoms. Or, too much salt (from overfertilization) has been translocated to the leaf margins. In the Southeastern United States, the bacterium Xylella fastidiosa has been associated with these symptoms in red maple, elm, oak, and sycamore. Based on periodic testing, this bacterium has never been found on maple trees with scorch symptoms in the PNW.


","Leaf margins and areas between veins turn brown. Twig dieback may follow. Symptoms can be severe in eastern Washington when bright, hot days follow cool, moist weather during leaf emergence.


","

1) When irrigating, wet the entire root zone infrequently during the summer. Avoid over-watering.

2) Provide good drainage and avoid soil compaction.

3) To avoid reflected heat, do not plant close to buildings or paved surfaces, and avoid rock and black plastic mulches.

4) Avoid root and trunk injury.

5) Do not overfertilize.

Maple ,(Acer spp.)-Leaf Spots,"Phyllosticta minutissima, a fungus, has been reported from Oregon and Washington. Not considered an economic landscape problem. Spores are thought to be rain splashed.
The fungi Sphaerulina aceris (formerly Septoria aceris)  and Xenostigmina zilleri (formerly Cercosporella aceris)  are reported to be a common problem on big leaf maple in Washington.


","On different maple species, Phyllosticta spots vary considerably in shape, size, and color. Usually they are small, irregularly circular, and reddish brown with narrow to broad purplish borders. Small, black, fruiting bodies (pycnidia) may be seen in the necrotic areas and may be arranged in a circular pattern. On Japanese maple, which the disease may severely damage, spots are a straw to tan color with a definite margin. The spot's center may be transparent. On sugar and Rocky Mountain maples, spots commonly have a narrow, purplish border. Diseased tissue often falls out, leaving holes in the leaf.
Sphaerulina aceris - Circular, brown spots, up to half-inch in diameter, on the leaves. The centers of the spots become tan to cream colored and bear minute black dots (the fruiting bodies) on the upper surface.
Xenostigmina zilleri - Conspicuous, concentrically zoned spots about an inch in diameter are formed. These often merge to involve a considerable area of the leaf. The central portion of the spot is light brown, the margin dark brown to blackish.


","

1) Rake and destroy fallen leaves.

2) Avoid overhead irrigation that keeps trees wet for an extended period of time.

Maple ,(Acer spp.)-Nectria Canker,"Nectria cinnabarina (asexual: Tubercularia vulgaris) and Neonectria ditissima (asexual: N. galligena), fungi that invade trees through wounds and injuries including winter injury, drought damage, sunscald, leaf scars, cracks in the twig axil, or senescent low branches. Spores are splash dispersed from fruiting bodies that exude spores in rainy weather or during irrigation.


","N. cinnabarina-girdling cankers form on twigs, limbs, and sometimes trunks; then affected parts die. Cankers appear as slightly sunken areas generally associated with wounds. Cankers are not obvious until striking, orange-red, fungus-fruiting structures (perithecia) develop in large numbers in the cankered area.
N. galligena-Symptoms are similar to those for N. cinnabarina. However, if the tree or branch is not girdled, an elongate or elliptical canker forms year after year. Branches can become quite swollen and weakened and may break at this point in wind or ice storms.


","

1) Remove and destroy affected twigs and limbs. Do not leave them on the ground between rows; carry them out to a burn pile or rotovate them into the soil so they are completely buried.

2) Prune during dry weather near the end of the dormant period.

3) Avoid wounds.

4) Avoid leaving pruning stubs when removing rootstock top growth. Make a clean cut with a sharp tool, which will heal promptly.

5) Maintain tree vigor through proper fertilizing and watering.

","Apply fungicide after pruning but before a rain or irrigation to protect wounds against infection. No specific registrations are for this purpose. Many fungicides recommended for anthracnose control also help protect trees from nectria canker.

Maple ,(Acer spp.)-Phytophthora Root Rot,"The fungus-like organism, Phytophthora spp., has been found in rotted maple (especially Acer palmatum) roots and branch tip diebacks by the OSU Plant Clinic. In addition, P. cactorum was found by the OSU Plant Clinic associated with bleeding trunk cankers. Phytophthora gonapodyides and other species have been found in symptomless roots of Acer rubrum shipped from the west coast. Other organisms, such as Pythium spp., have also been found in association with rotting maple roots.
Flooded or poorly drained soil or media encourages disease development. These organisms survive unfavorable periods within soil, media, and infected plant debris. Under favorable conditions, spores germinate and infect roots. After infection, the microorganism spreads mainly in the inner bark tissues of the root. They survive as various spores in the soil, container media, or infected roots. Movement of infected plants and/or soil can spread the microorganism.


","Aboveground symptoms are generally slow or poor growth, which can be mistaken for other problems such as nutritional deficiencies. Root systems; however, are rotted with few if any feeder roots. In advanced cases, many roots are in various stages of decay. The vascular cambium near the root crown shows a brownish discoloration that has a distinct border with healthy tissue. Stem lesions may also accompany rotted roots.
Bleeding cankers on trunks also kill the underlying vascular cambial tissue, which may be stained reddish-brown. These dark brown-to-black areas on the bark often look wet with a slow oozing of liquid from the lower portion of the canker.


","

1) Container production should be on raised benches or gravel covered beds sloped to quickly drain excess water.

2) Avoid reusing pots from a previous crop for propagation. If pots must be reused then wash off all debris and soak in a sanitizing solution or treat with aerated steam for 30 min.

3) Avoid ponding of water around plants.

4) Avoid over- or underwatering plants.

5) Plant in a well-drained area or container media.

6) Avoid leaving trees on the ground during rainy winter weather.

7) Remove and destroy all infected plants and plant debris.

8) Prevent mechanical injury to trees, especially late in the season.

9) Do not let sprinkler irrigation wet landscape tree trunks.

","To minimize the development of resistant fungi, alternate or tank-mix fungicides from different groups that have different modes of action. Use fungicides as preventative treatments, they generally do not save heavily infected plants. The phenylamide and phosphonate fungicides (Group 4 and 33 fungicides) do not kill these organisms. They can only prevent establishment of the organism before it gets into the plant. They can also prevent continued growth if the organism is already inside the plant thereby delaying symptoms that might have developed. Once chemical activity has subsided with time, the organism can resume growth within infected plants.

Maple ,(Acer spp.)-Powdery Mildew,"Phyllactinia marissallii, a fungus that attacks only maple. Sawadaea bicornis has been found in Washington and Idaho on Norway maple and S. tulansnei has been found in Idaho and Oregon on Norway maple. A species in the genus Sawadaea has been found in lower mainland British Columbia (on big leaf maple). In Idaho, powdery mildew seems to be restricted to Acer platanoides in northern Idaho while the native Rocky Mountain maple populations are not mildewed.
Conidia are readily wind disseminated. Chasmothecia develop within the external hyphae and form appendages late in their development. The uneven wall thickness and bulbous nature of the appendages allows the entire cleistocarp to be dislodged from the host. When dry, the appendages flex like a spider's legs and allow the cleistocarp to be dislodged and carried by wind. These fungi may overwinter as chasmothecia or through buds infected the previous season.


","A white fungal growth often occurs with small black fruiting bodies (chasmothecia), on the undersides of mature leaves. Phyllactinia sp. typically have very sparsely growing mycelia and colonies can be difficult to detect while Sawadaea sp. have more obvious robust colonies. S. tulansnei was described as having white mycelium present in irregular, discrete, scattered spots or almost continuously on the upper surfaces of leaves and also was present on some petioles.

Maple ,(Acer spp.)-Tar Spots,"Rhytisma punctatum, a fungus. The disease is common on bigleaf maple on the Pacific Coast and also attacks many other species, particularly silver, mountain, and striped maple. The fungus overwinters in stroma on fallen leaves. Leaf areas with stroma do not decompose as fast as areas that are not infected. Infection occurs as spores are ejected from these overwintered leaves during rainy periods in the spring.


","When first invaded, leaves develop minute (1 mm diameter), water-soaked spots that turn brown. Soon small, dark dots appear on the upper leaf surface between the veins. The black, tar-like spots (stroma) are slightly raised above the leaf surface. The lower leaf surface is yellow under the tarspot. Leaves may fall prematurely if infection is severe.

Maple ,(Acer spp.)-Verticillium Wilt,"Samples with Verticillium wilt have dominated the maple problem diagnoses sent to the OSU Plant Clinic. Verticillium dahliae, a soilborne fungus that is almost impossible to eradicate once established in the soil. There are over 300 plant species susceptible to this fungus. It forms microsclerotia that germinate in response to exudates from roots that are growing nearby. Mycelia from the microsclerotia infect the roots. The fungus grows into the xylem where it colonizes the plant through mycelial growth and conidial production. Fluid movement in the xylem passively transports the conidia. Once in the xylem, this fungus partially blocks water movement and produces toxins that result in wilt symptoms. The cambium may die, resulting in an elongate canker, which can be colonized by other pathogens such as Nectria sp. and Cytospora sp. Current-season sapwood may not be infected, and symptoms may not reappear; or infection may occur without foliar symptoms. This may result in branch dieback or bud failure in spring.
After diseased plant parts die, microsclerotia form inside the tissue. Once the infected tissue decays, microsclerotia are released and can survive several years in soil. Many weeds are susceptible and can help the fungus survive and disperse. Plant-parasitic nematodes also can increase Verticillium wilt incidence and severity. Other diseases, such as bacterial dieback, can also increase in incidence and severity on trees with Verticillium wilt. The Norway maple cultivars Jade Glen and Parkway are tolerant and have few symptoms.


","Leaves on one side of the tree or on just an individual branch suddenly wilt and die. Leaves are yellowish and smaller than normal. Leaf scorch can also occur at leaf margins. Leaves die and fall or hang on dead branches. Later, other limbs wilt and die. Greenish streaks or bands that follow the grain can be found in sapwood but perhaps not in the earliest stages of infection. In cross sections of the stem, vascular discoloration will appear in rings or arcs. Vascular discoloration is more likely to be found in larger branches and trunks. Infected trees may die within a few weeks or live for years.


","

1) Prune off and burn affected limbs preferably before leaves fall and thus before new inoculum is incorporated into the ground.

2) Clean pruning equipment after use.

3) Do not track soil from infested areas into clean areas. Clean boots, equipment, and tools before leaving an infested area.

4) Keep nitrogenous fertilizers to a minimum-enough only to produce normal, not succulent, growth.

5) If the tree dies and/or is removed, replace it with a nonsusceptible host such as any conifer, birch, dogwood, or sycamore.

6) Avoid planting maple in fields with a history of Verticillium wilt. Avoid fields previously planted to potato or tomato; however, former peppermint fields may be lower risk.

7) A preplant soil test for  propagules will help determine a planting site.

8) Incorporating freshly mown Italian ryegrass followed by covering the soil with plastic for 3 months in the late summer was effective in the Netherlands at reducing disease incidence in a nursery crop of Norway maple planted 6 months later. Effect was observed up to 4 years after planting.

","S. tageticola produces oval to irregularly shaped spots that are smoky gray to black. Small, black, fruiting bodies (pycnidia) develop in the necrotic area. Infections usually start on lower leaves and progress to higher leaves.
Alternaria tagetica can result in a blight of leaves, stems, and flowers. Dark-brown necrotic spots form initially and may be surrounded by a chlorotic halo. Leaf spots can expand and coalesce leading to wilting and drying of the leaves with eventual plant death. Flower petals can become totally darken and shriveled.

Mustard Greens ,(Brassica juncea)-Black Leg (Phoma Stem Canker),"Leptosphaeria maculans (syn. Plenodomus lingam, anamorph: Phoma lingam) is a fungus that can infect a range of cruciferous crops. Host plants include Brassica crops (broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cabbage, collards, canola, kale, rutabaga, turnip, etc.), Sinapis (white and yellow mustard), and Raphanus (daikon and radish). Cruciferous weeds common in the Pacific Northwest can be host to black leg, including: birdsrape mustard (Brassica rapa), black mustard (B. nigra), western yellow cress or curvepod yellowcress (Rorippa curvisiliqua), tansymustard (Descurainia pinnata), hedge mustard (Sisymbrium officinale), tumble mustard (S. altissimum), small tumbleweed mustard (S. loeselii), pennycress (Thlaspi arvense), mouseear cress (Arabidopsis thaliana), annual wallrocket (Diplotaxis muralis), perennial wallrocket (D. tenuifolia), and wild radish (Raphanus raphanistrum).
The fungus survives on plant debris or on dead portions of living plants as pycnidia (asexual reproductive structures) or pseudothecia (sexual reproductive structures). Pseudothecia release ascospores that can be moved long distances by wind, at least several miles and perhaps further with storm fronts. Infected plant residues remain infectious until plant debris decomposes, which may take up to four years. In fall-sown crops or on winter weeds, pseudothecia can form on dead portions of infected plants prior to plant death, and will continue to be produced after harvest on residues remaining on the soil surface.  In spring-sown crops, pseudothecia do not form until after harvest, and their production on residues atop the soil typically starts the following fall after a couple of wet periods. Ascospores are released from the pseudothecia following wet or humid conditions and when mean temperatures are between 46°F and 59°F.  Conditions conducive for ascospore production and release commonly occur during the fall, winter, and springtime throughout the Pacific Northwest. Trap plants deployed weekly in multiple sites around the Willamette Valley in western Oregon, beginning in October 2014 and 2015, showed that ascospore infections began mid-October. During 2015-2016, ascospore infections of trap plants occurred from mid-October into May with severe disease pressure during February and March. Wounding, insect injury, or herbicide injury can result in greater disease severity.
Two types of pycnidia (which produce asexual spores known as pycnidiospores) can be found; one on infected, live plants (thinner-walled pycnidium with a neck) and the other on crop residues (thicker-walled pycnidium with a narrow ostiole). Pycnidiospores are dispersed by splashing rain or irrigation water, so pycnidiospore movement is limited to relatively short distances, but pycnidiospores can add to the overall incidence and severity of disease build-up within a field. Workers or equipment moving through infected plantings during wet conditions can also spread disease.
Black leg can also move with infected seed, Leptosphaeria can survive for years in association with seed. But if, as a general practice, seed lots used for planting are Leptosphaeria-free then the spread of regional epidemics is thought to arise from infected plant debris. Even low levels of seed infection, when coupled with weather favorable for disease, can lead to severe losses, including stand die-out within a field. The Oregon Department of Agriculture requires that all crucifer seed, even half ounce or smaller packets, that is to be planted in Oregon must be accompanied by an official test showing that the untreated seed is free from black leg (Leptosphaeria species).
This disease can reduce vegetable, forage, and seed yields. After a disease outbreak in a larger geographic area, the threat of yield loss in fall-sown crops is much greater due to the abundance of affected crop residues on the soil surface, especially if field-wide epidemics occur in no-till systems. Replanting or allowing volunteers to grow in a field site after a black leg epidemic can result in high numbers of infected seedlings by fall in western Oregon or Washington seed fields, perpetuating the disease at that location. Planting adjacent to a previously-infected field can result in a high disease incidence (40 to 60%) by December in the new planting, while planting within a few miles of an infected residue site can result in generalized infections across new fields (1 to 5%). Researchers at OSU have observed uncontrolled black leg infections in fall-planted seed fields in western Oregon to increase from a low disease incidence (1 to 5%) to high (40 to 90% of the stand infected) in a six-week period. Secondary diseases are common on plants with black leg; Sclerotinia, Botrytis, and soft rot bacteria are especially common on black leg-infected plants in western Oregon during rainy weather and may mask black leg infections by six weeks later.


","Pale, irregular spots develop on cotyledons, leaves, stems, or petioles, later becoming somewhat circular to oval, ashy-gray with scattered tiny, black dots (pycnidia) on the surface. Elongated stem cankers with purple borders develop after the fungus grows downward inside the plant from initial leaf infections. Stem cankers may girdle stems and extend below the soil surface, causing a brown-to-gray-to-black rot in the lower stem and roots. Vascular tissues turn black in color prior to external black leg symptoms. Damping-off can occur if plants are infected at the seedling stage, usually through the use of infected seeds. Plants produced from infected seeds that survive the seedling stage are stunted and often develop a rot of the stem at or just below the soil line, which moves upwards and can cause plant death.
In seed crops, leaf spots may appear on over-wintered leaves at initially low levels but increase as pycnidiospores spread the leaf spot. As seed plants mature, they may fall sideways from lack of root anchorage or stem cankers may cause the top of the plant to fall over. Symptoms on seed pods are rare and inconspicuous.


","

1) Control susceptible weeds and control volunteer crucifers.

2) Plant only seed certified to be to be free of .

3) Avoid planting in or adjacent to a site where disease has occurred within the last 3 to 4 years.

4) Delay spring plantings to avoid periods of ascospore release.

5) Bury residues as soon as possible after harvest by deep plowing, or remove plant debris. Flailing followed by a shallow incorporation may be sufficient depending on amount and size of plant debris as well as environmental conditions.

6) Hot water seed treatment for 15 min. in water at 122°F (50°C).

","Seed treatment and a foliar fungicide program will be essential if growing seed fields in any region where black leg epidemics have occurred across a larger geographic area. Infected seed can occur at levels below the detection threshold of current seed testing in seed lots officially certified to be free of black leg, so chemical or hot water seed treatments are critical for controlling disease potentially introduced even with tested seed.


",
Mustard Greens ,(Brassica juncea)-Clubroot,"The disease is caused by Plasmodiophora brassicae, a fungus-like microorganism that can survive in soil 18 years or more after an infected crop. It can be spread through any means that moves soil: wind and water, footwear and equipment, and in infected transplants. Soils that are cool, wet (70% to 80% water-holding capacity) and acidic favor the pathogen.
Clubroot probably affects all species of the cruciferous group, including wild mustard. The microorganism that causes clubroot occurs worldwide and possibly also infects plants in the rose, poppy, and grass families including Agrostis, Dactylis, Holcus, and Lolium spp. However, these plants rarely show typical symptoms of the disease.


","Plants wilt in hot weather but partly recover at night. Top growth may be stunted, yellowish, and likely to prematurely bolt or to wilt in hot weather. The distinctive symptom is abnormally large roots-fine roots, secondary roots, the taproot, or even on the underground stem. Roots develop clubs (swellings) that can be 5 or 6 inches wide. The largest clubs usually are just below the soil surface on the larger roots. Affected seedlings will not show any root swellings until about 3 weeks after infection. When susceptible plants are attacked in the seedling stage, they can die. When plants are attacked at a later stage, the disease rarely kills, but roots that are severely distorted have a reduced capacity to absorb minerals and water from soil. But even with extensive root clubbing, top growth may be nearly normal, depending on environmental conditions and cultural practices.


","

1) Grow susceptible plants in clubroot-free fields, which are difficult to find in the Willamette Valley of Oregon.

2) Control wild mustards if they are a weed problem.

3) If growing susceptible crops in suspect or infested fields, incorporate enough finely ground limestone the year before planting to raise the soil pH above 7. Use lime applications that increase soil pH as well as level of soil calcium. Thoroughly mix lime into the soil to maximize potential disease control. Lime inhibits disease development, but will not prevent a disease outbreak if the spore load in the soil is sufficiently high. Different soil types vary considerably in their response to efforts to alter the pH with lime. Therefore, measure the initial soil pH, follow Soil Moisture Potential (SMP) test recommendations, and monitor the changes after application. Periodically monitor the pH in subsequent years to determine the stability of the change.

4) If planting in a suspect or infected field, incorporating hydrated lime (1,500 lb/A) at least 6 weeks before planting, whether pH is neutral or alkaline, gives additional disease control.

5) The form of nitrogen fertilizer can also influence disease. Using calcium nitrate may result in less disease compared to ammonium sulfate or urea.

6) Early infection of seedlings can result in severe symptoms, so it is important to use only uninfected seedbeds and clean transplant media, trays, and equipment. Do not lime seedbeds or transplant-growing media heavily. It may mask the disease, which could flare up once seedlings are transplanted to a soil of lower pH.

7) Never allow drainage water or soil from an infested field to enter an irrigation source. Spores are moved easily in irrigation water.

8) Work in pathogen-free fields before moving people and machinery into infested fields. Thoroughly clean soil from machinery and equipment before moving from an infested field to a clean one.

9) Long rotations (6 years or longer) help prevent a pathogen buildup and reduce disease.

10) If clubroot occurs, hilling-up plants can encourage production of adventitious roots, which may result in a better yield.

Mustard Greens ,(Brassica juncea)-Downy Mildew (Staghead),"Peronospora parasitica (= Hyaloperonospora parasitica), a fungus-like microorganism that overwinters in roots or infected plant debris, affects nearly all cultivated and weed plants in the Crucifer family. Strains of the microorganism are generally more aggressive on the crop plant from which they were obtained. For example, the radish strain causes little damage to cabbage. Spores may be spread as contaminants on seeds. Conidia can spread by wind or water droplets. High humidity, fog, drizzling rains, and heavy dew favor disease development and spread. Optimum conditions for disease development are night temperatures of 46°F to 61°F for 4 or more successive nights, and day temperature about 75°F or lower. In areas with mild, wet winters, such as western Oregon or Washington, downy mildew can continue infecting fall-planted seed crops during the winter months, although only small amount of the total leaf surface area may be colonized on individual leaves, but this allows for a build-up within a field, potentially leading to severe increase in infections of spring growth if spring conditions are wet and mild. Fall and spring downy-mildew management is important for fall-planted seed fields to avoid extensive staghead formation, where an inflorescence is abnormal in shape and development due to downy mildew or white rust. White rust and downy mildew are commonly found cohabitating together in leaf colonies on brassicas in western Oregon and elsewhere.
Resistance is being incorporated into commercial cultivars, but at present no resistant commercial cultivars are available.


","Young seedlings are more susceptible than adult plants and can die from downy mildew if infected when young. The first observable symptom is small, light green-yellow lesions on the upper leaf surface, later showing on the undersurface. The spots turn yellow or orangish as they enlarge. During periods of high humidity, a grayish white moldy growth appears on the leaf's underside. Later the leaf may become papery and die.
On fall-planted seed crops, downy mildew can create tiny leaf spots during the winter months or other times where small clusters of, even just a few, conidia and conidiophores are produced on the underside of the leaf surface; rarely in large enough quantity to be seen without magnification. During warmer rain breaks, individual lesions may rapidly enlarge and then quickly collapse with a secondary soft rot during rainy periods. This can be confused for cold-damaged tissues with subsequent secondary leaf rot, which can also be common in areas of Oregon and Washington seed production during certain winters.
Downy mildew on an inflorescence can lead to staghead formation, abnormal shape and development of the inflorescence due to downy mildew or white rust.  White rust and downy mildew are commonly found together in leaf colonies on brassicas in western Oregon and elsewhere.

Mustard Greens ,(Brassica juncea)-Light Leaf Spot,"The fungus, Cylindrosporium concentricum (sexual stage: Pyrenopeziza brassicae) has been found in Oregon on canola, turnip, volunteer or wild radish, wild mustard, black mustard, vegetable Brassica seed fields, and Brassica species used as cover crops during 2014. The disease was found during 2016 in the Skagit Valley of western Washington on Brassica cover crops and wild mustard. All Brassicas grown in the Pacific Northwest are probably susceptible but the specific host range within Brassicaceae is unknown at this time. Oilseed rape and cauliflower are reported to be more susceptible than Brussels sprouts or kale, but there is a range of susceptibility within each crop species. The pathogen has been a problem on oilseed rape in various parts of the world with seed losses estimated at 22% when outbreaks have occurred in the United Kingdom. This disease hasn't been previously reported in North America though an infected mustard field was found in western Oregon during 1998. Oilseed rape is very susceptible and losses results from stand die-out, reduced pod numbers, premature pod ripening, or an overall growth reduction with less severe infections. Brassicas grown as vegetables in other areas of the globe, where this disease has been reported, suffer blemish defects by relatively mild infections, causing a decrease in quality but not of yield quantity. Trichloroacetic acid-based herbicides may increase plant susceptibility by affecting the waxy layer of leaves.
Ascospores develop from apothecia on infected plant residues and can be wind-dispersed relatively long distances after a wetting period, infecting susceptible plants. Asexual spores (conidia) develop but spread relatively short distances by rain or splashing water, potentially causing pod infections during the following spring. Seed can be infected or casually infested with the asexual stage yet seed transmission occurs at very low rates due to rapid die-out of the pathogen on seed. Still, epidemics can be initiated by seedborne inoculum or from neighboring fields of infected plants or residues, or from infected volunteers. Wet conditions and cool temperatures (around 60°F is optimum) promote disease development. Fall-infected plants may remain symptomless through the winter season till the following spring.


","This fungus can attack leaves, stems and pods. Flecking may be observed on cotyledons while leaf infections start as discolored patches that develop into irregular brown lesions with cracked centers, sometimes turning black. Leaf lesions can coalesce, causing death of leaves. When leaves are infected young, distortion can develop. Stem lesions are elongated brownish streaks with grayish-black margins and can be mistaken for black leg, except lesions are usually superficial. Flower infections may cause abortion. Pods infected early appear distorted while pods infected later result in relatively healthy looking pods but will have white spore masses. Seedlings can be killed or plants may be stunted.


","

1) Control susceptible weeds and volunteer  plants.

2) Remove plant debris or bury by deep-plowing, important for preventing sexual recombinants from developing with new virulence or fungicide resistance. Flailing followed by a shallow incorporation may be sufficient depending on amount and size of plant debris as well as environmental conditions.

3) Rotate out of crucifers for 3 years.

4) Avoid planting adjacent to a field infected the previous season.

Mustard Greens ,(Brassica juncea)-Powdery Mildew,"The fungus, Erysiphe cruciferarum (syn. E. polygoni), can infect most crucifer crops and cruciferous weeds, but strains exist that have specificity and will infected only a subset of the crucifers. Older leaves are more susceptible to powdery mildew than younger leaves. Stressed plants will be more susceptible to disease. The fungus survives on infected hosts or as chasmothecia (formerly cleistothecia, sexually-produced survival structures) on infected crop debris. Disease is promoted under cool conditions of low rainfall and reduced relative humidity.


","Small, discrete white patches develop on both leaf surfaces. Later, patches coalesce until a powdery mass of white mycelium and spores cover the entire leaf. Leaves later become yellow, then brown, and prematurely defoliate.

Mustard Greens ,(Brassica juncea)-Sclerotinia Stem Rot,"Sclerotinia sclerotiorum is a fungus that overwinters as small black structures (sclerotia) in plant debris or in soil.  Sclerotia may survive up to 8 years. After a conditioning period of several weeks at 40°F in moist soil, sclerotia can germinate in moist soil when temperatures are 59°F to 65°F and produce a small, stalked, cup-shaped fruiting structure (apothecium; plural: apothecia), which releases millions of spores into the air. Sporulating apothecia can persist 5 to 10 days. Spores are forcibly ejected and a few may be blown up to a mile but most land nearby. Spores can survive 2 weeks. Spores can infect senescent tissue such as leaves or plant debris and then invade any healthy part of the plant it contacts. Moist conditions within the plant canopy favor infection. Rain, dew, and/or irrigation practices that keep foliage wet for long periods favor white mold development.
Other host plants include bean, pea, lettuce, carrots, cabbage, parsnip, potato, sunflower, radish, other crucifers, and cucurbits. Dandelion (Taraxacum officinale) is a very susceptible weed host.


","The disease is mainly on aboveground parts, producing a cottony white mold. As leaves decay, small white bodies appear in the mold and gradually change from white to black as hardened sclerotia develop.

Mustard Greens ,(Brassica juncea)-White Leaf Spot and Gray Stem,"The fungus, Pseudocercosporella capsellae (sexual stage: Mycosphaerella capsellae), has been observed in various Brassica seed crops in Oregon. It has been reported in oilseed rape in the United Kingdom and Canada. Pod losses of 15% have been reported in Europe. Turnip, Chinese cabbage, mustards and oilseed rape are thought to be more susceptible than cabbage, cauliflower, broccoli and other vegetable Brassica species. Horseradish and radish are susceptible to white leaf spot as well as weedy types such as wild radish, wild mustard, and shepherd's purse.
How the pathogen overwinters in the Pacific Northwest is unknown at this time. In the United Kingdom, ascospores develop on infected Brassica or Raphanus residues during the autumn and can be wind-dispersed relatively long distances following rain or dew events. Beginning in late fall, the asexual spores (conidia) can develop and are spread relatively short distances by rain or splashing water, potentially causing pod infections during the following spring, although seed transmission is not thought to play a major role in disease spread. Temperatures of 50°F to 60°F under moist conditions promote disease development.


","This fungus can attack leaves, stems and pods. Tan, irregular or roundish spots develop on leave, especially leaf tips and edges, later becoming ashy-gray to white with a brownish margin and sometimes a yellowish halo. White conidia can be observed on the underside of leaf spots. Leaf spots will become dark brown as leaves senesce, due to the initiation of the sexual stage. The center of older lesions may fall out, resulting in a shot hole appearance. Lesions may coalesce when disease is severe, resulting in defoliation. Stem lesions are elongated and first brown, turning ashy-gray to white with a brownish margin and numerous tiny dark specks due to the formation of the sexual stage; there is a distinct boundary between diseased and healthy tissue on the stem. Gray stem lesions are superficial; the pith is not severely infected. Pod infections are at first small brown spots that expand and turn grayish-white with numerous tiny dark specks due to the formation of the sexual stage.

Ninebark ,(Physocarpus spp.)-Powdery Mildew,"The fungus Podosphaera physocarpi is reported to infect eastern ninebark (Physocarpus opulifolius) grown in Oregon. The OSU Plant Clinic has detected this disease on eastern ninebark. The green foliage cultivar Nanus did not develop colonies in a two-year study in CT. The purple foliage cultivars Seward Summer Wine and the yellow foliage cultivar Luteus get the disease but are considered resistant. Highly susceptible cultivars include Dart's Gold, Morning Star, and Nugget. Powdery mildew is also suspected to occur on Pacific ninebark (P. capitatus).
This fungus is favored by conditions that produce high humidity but dry leaves. It is a highly specialized pathogen that forms a close association with the host. Conditions that favor the host also favor the pathogen. Much of the fungus remains outside infected plant parts where it grows on the surface but sinks root-like structures called haustoria into plant cells to obtain nutrients. The white growth seen is composed of both mycelium and fungal spores.


","White superficial powdery colonies on leaves, stems, inflorescences and infructescences. Witches' brooms consisting of light pink to white colored, thickened shoots with stunted leaves also occur.

Oak ,(Quercus spp.)-Anthracnose,"Apiognomonia errabunda, a fungus widespread and common in western Washington, Oregon, and coastal British Columbia and found occasionally in eastern Washington. It is of little significance most years but can be serious in prolonged moist weather in spring and summer. Large trees can sustain severe disease without permanent damage. The disease can be a problem in production nurseries growing susceptible species.
White oak (Quercus alba) is highly susceptible. The fungus is commonly found as an endophyte of Oregon white oak (Q. garryanna) yet it rarely causes any disease on this host. Juvenile leaves are most susceptible to infection and become resistant as they enlarge and age. Wet rainy weather favors spore distribution and infection during bud break and early shoot growth. The fungus overwinters in leaf debris, twigs, stems and cankers.


","Scattered brown spots or brown dead areas develop on leaves, commoly along veins. Severely affected leaves may curl, pucker, or twist down. Defoliation may occur. The fungus may invade the twigs, causing small cankers and possible twig dieback.

Oak ,(Quercus spp.)-Armillaria Root Rot,"Armillaria mellea is likely the species on various hardwoods and/or fruit trees. The fungus can live many years as a saprophyte in soil, on infected stumps, roots, and other organic matter. It breaks down the lignin and cellulose in plant tissue. Natural oak-root infections will not threaten the native oak's life. A few roots may be infected, but the tree can replace them. This balance can be maintained throughout the tree's lifespan without serious damage unless the balance tips in favor of fungal growth and against root growth. Surface watering in warm months softens the main roots in the crown area and favors the progress of the fungus. This is a soilborne fungus that is capable of attacking many different plant hosts. These fungi are most commonly found in forests and natural areas where they infect a variety of trees and shrubs.
This fungus may form mushrooms at the base of infected trees in fall and winter. Mushrooms are honey-colored or light tan, with a stalk 4 to 6 inches or more in height and a cap 2 to 4 inches across, often dotted with brown scales. Spores are formed along the gills and are wind-blown. Spores are not a significant means of infecting healthy plants but can colonize old stumps and dead trees. The fungus spreads vegetatively, below ground, which leads to the formation of groups of dead and dying plants called ""disease centers."" The fungus can survive on woody host roots long after the host dies. Its vegetative fungal tissue (mycelium) decomposes root wood for nutrients as it grows. When infected plants are removed, infected roots that remain below ground serve as a source of inoculum for new plants placed in the same location.


","The first visible disease symptom is a decline and dieback in which leaves turn yellow, wilt, and die. At ground level and just below, white felt-like masses of fungus grow on the plant crown between the bark and the wood. Scattered through the soil are black shoestring-like strands called rhizomorphs. Rhizomorphs may look like roots on the outside but have an entirely different structure when cut open in cross-section.


","

1) For oak and many shade trees, removing soil in a 3-ft radius of the crown and the main trunk root area to minimize conditions that favor the fungus.

2) Water deeply when watering is needed. Avoid watering lawns under trees or any surface watering that might wet the crown and trunk root area.

3) Trees that are vigorous, as a result of favorable climate and sound cultural practices usually are more tolerant.

4) If removing infected trees, remove as much of the root system as possible and replant with resistant species.

Oak ,(Quercus spp.)-Cytospora Canker,"The OSU Plant Clinic has found Cytospora sp. on a few submitted oak samples since the 1950s. The fungus is opportunistic and is quick to attack plants predisposed by heat, drought, winter damage, or infection by other pathogens. It also can colonize dying or dead bark as a saprophyte.


","Portions of the branch die and may develop small pimple-like fruiting bodies (pycnidia) of the fungus.

Oak ,(Quercus spp.)-Ganoderma Root and Butt Rot,"Ganoderma applanatum (formerly Fomes applanatus),  also called the ""Artist's conk,"" is a common root and butt rot fungus on oaks and other hardwoods, especially Oregon white oak. Decay is a white-mottled rot of the trunk and large roots. Decay can extend more than 10 feet above ground. Presence of conks indicates internal decay, but the extent of decay is difficult to determine from external indicators alone because it often is associated with wounds. Large conks usually indicate substantial internal decay. Decay in large roots and the lower bole increases the failure potential of the tree.
Wood decay fungi enter trees primarily through wounds that expose sapwood or heartwood. Injuries from pruning, sunburn, light-ning, or cultivating equipment can expose susceptible wood. Large wounds and stub and horizontal cuts are often entry sites for decay fungi. Mycelial growth of the fungus proceeds with colonization and utilization of wood as a food source.


","Sparse foliage with limb dieback may be symptomatic but these are not consistently associated with the disease. Decay is a white-mottled rot of the trunk and large roots. Decay can extend more than 10 feet above ground. Perennial woody conks appear on the base of the tree or on trunk wounds. Conks are grey-to-brown on top, with a pure white underside (pore layer) that turns brown when scratched (spores are cinnamon in color). The bracket-shaped conks can achieve large size, over 2 feet in diameter.
Cultural control


1) Avoid wounding trees to prevent decay. Mowing equipment should not injure the roots, crown, or lower trunk.

2) Make pruning cuts adjacent to, but not into, the supporting branch, and prune when branches are small to enhance callus formation and wound healing.

3) Inspect trees for decay and/or conks to assess tree stability

4) Remove affected trees to avoid damage to surrounding property.

Oak ,(Quercus spp.)-Inonotus Root and Butt Rot,"Pseudoinonotus dryadeus (formerly Polyporus dryadeus), a common root and butt rot fungus on oaks, especially Oregon white oak in western Washington and Oregon. Presence of conks indicates decay, but the extent of decay is difficult to determine from external indicators alone because it often is localized in the tree. Decay in large roots and the lower bole may increase the failure potential of the tree.
Wood decay fungi enter trees primarily through wounds that expose sapwood or heartwood. Injuries from pruning, sunburn, light-ning, or cultivating equipment can expose susceptible wood. Large wounds and stub and horizontal cuts are often entry sites for decay fungi. Mycelial growth of the fungus proceeds with colonization and utilization of wood as a food source.


","Sparse foliage with limb dieback may be symptomatic but these are not consistently associated with the disease. Wood decay is a white-mottled rot generally confined to the large roots and the base of the tree near ground level. Annual conks appear on the base of the tree or large roots at ground level in summer and early autumn. Conks are large (7 inches or more in diameter) and thick, tan to grey-brown on top with a pale-tan to grey underside (pore surface). The top surface of fresh conks has numerous droplets of clear-yellow liquid that darken with age. For this reason, it is sometimes referred to as the ""weeping conk."" The upper surface of conks weathers to black and deteriorates in winter to a dark-brown or black mass.

Oak ,(Quercus spp.)-Leaf Blister,"The fungus Taphrina caerulescens is a common disease affecting many species of oaks. Members of the red oak group are particularly susceptible to infection. Disease development is favored by cool, wet springs. White oaks are rarely infected, even in years with cool, wet springs. Heavy infections of red oaks impair their appearance but do not endanger the tree's health.
Spores produced on the surface of the leaf spots in mid-summer are carried by wind and rain to the buds and become lodged under the bud scales. Here they overwinter. The following spring, they germinate and cause new infections. Infection occurs in the spring when tender, young leaves are exposed. Cool, wet weather is required for spore germination on young leaves, and if these conditions prevail, severe infection can occur. If weather conditions are not favorable for spore germination shortly after bud break, only minor infection will occur. As the leaves mature, they become more resistant to infection.


","Symptoms appear in early summer as yellow, circular, raised areas, 0.06 to 0.5 inch in diameter. The blisters are scattered over the upper leaf surface with corresponding gray depressions on the lower surface. They turn from yellow to reddish brown with pale yellow margins, and then become dull brown with age. Several blisters may merge and cause the leaves to curl. By midsummer, microscopic spores are produced by the fungus on the surface of the leaf spots, sometimes giving a white or light tan, powdery appearance to the lesions.

Oak ,(Quercus spp.)-Leaf Scorch,"Many possible causes. Plants under stress (such as from drought or heat) may not provide sufficient water to their leaves. Trees placed near heat-reflecting surfaces such as buildings or pavement often suffer from heat stress. Other possible causes of scorch include damage to roots or stem, soil compaction (which can reduce drainage, resulting in root damage), or excessive salts from overuse of chemical fertilizers.


","Leaves edges turn bronze, then later brown and dry. In severe cases, the scorch may spread to areas between veins or entire twigs may die back.


","

1) Avoid injury to roots and trunk.

2) Do not overfertilize.

3) Do not pave over the root zone of established trees.

4) Do not plant trees directly against the sunny sides of buildings.

5) Heavy foot traffic, construction, and heavy equipment can compact soil and damage roots.

6) Irrigate affected plants during dry periods. Wet the entire root zone but do not overwater. Try to water oaks deeply but infrequently.

Oak ,(Quercus spp.)-Mistletoe (a True Mistletoe),"Phoradendron villosum, a parasitic plant that affects white oak (Quercus garryana), black oak (Q. kelloggii), red oak (Q. rubra), scarlet oak (Q. coccinea), and pin oak (Q. palustris) and occasionally is on alder, aspen, birch, locust, manzanita, buckeye, sycamore, walnut and willow. Generally found in western Oregon. This mistletoe does not grow on conifers or on other hardwoods. It derives water, mineral nutrients, and some organic nutrients from the xylem of the host. Most of its organic nutrients come from its own photosynthesis.
Birds such as robins and bluejays eat and spread seeds to other trees. Seeds pass through the bird's digestive tract but retain a sticky covering of threads. Once deposited on a branch, the seed germinates and infects small branches of a suitable host. The plant that develops produces many seeds that continue to infect the same host. Mistletoe may increase dramatically within a single tree where birds feed on berries, roost, and congregate. Seeds may be toxic to humans if eaten.
Considerable folklore and legend surround the properties and use of mistletoes including spiritual powers, medicinal uses, fertility, and good fortune. Many of these are associated with other genera of mistletoe. The origin of the custom of kissing under mistletoe is not known but may be associated with aspects of good fortune and fertility. There are no known replicated trials investigating these properties.


","The mistletoe is a large, green plant with somewhat hairy leaves. Stems are green and dichotomously (forked) branched. Plants usually are widely scattered on a branch. Flowers are inconspicuous and fruit are shiny, whitish berries.
Heavily infected trees are weak and grow more slowly. Weakened trees may be predisposed to insect attack and may succumb during drought or other adverse conditions. Branch and trunk swellings are frequent. Branches heavily laden with mistletoe often break off in storms or high winds; property damage may result. Principal damage to the tree is the mistletoe's unsightliness and, if branches die, a misshapen tree crown.

Oak ,(Quercus spp.)-Nectria Canker,"Neonectria ditissima (formerly Nectria galligena), a fungus, occasionally causes a perennial target-shaped canker on the trunk and limbs of Oregon white oak. In response to infection, the tree forms a callus ridge around the initial canker. The following year the fungus invades the heathy tissue beyond the callus ridge, and the tree forms another callus ridge. The repeating process of fungus growth and callus formation give the canker the appearance of a target with concentric rings. Pruning wounds or other types of mechanical injury serve as entry points for the fungus. Trees with stem cankers are subject to breakage at the canker when the canker affects more than approximately 30% to 40% of the stem diameter. Observations suggest that certain individual Oregon white oaks are highly susceptible, while most are not.


","The canker initially appears as a slightly sunken oval or round lesion on the stem. Round to oval woody target-shaped canker. Tiny red to dark brown fruiting bodies (perithecia) may be visible at the canker margin.

Chasmothecia develop within the external hyphae and form appendages late in their development. This fungus is favored by conditions that produce high humidity but dry leaves. It is a highly specialized pathogen that forms a close association with the host. Conditions that favor the host also favor the pathogen. Much of the fungus remains outside infected plant parts where it grows on the surface but sinks root-like structures called haustoria into plant cells to obtain nutrients. The white growth seen is composed of both mycelium and fungal spores. The disease in France is seen more often in the spring when disease severity has been high in the fall.

Oak ,(Quercus spp.)-Sudden Oak Death,"The disease was first reported in 1995 in Mill Valley, CA. Since, many oaks have died throughout the central coastal counties of California. Dying trees have been observed in urban and rural forests and woodlands. A fungus-like organism, Phytophthora ramorum, killing tanoaks, wild rhododendrons, and evergreen huckleberry in a few isolated spots just north of Brookings, OR, was found during the summer of 2001. There was also incidental leaf infection on salmonberry, cascara, myrtlewood, and poison oak (stem cankers). No oaks were involved. Federal and international quarantines have been established to prevent the spread of this pathogen in soil and infected plant material.
Since the initial discovery, Oregon has focused on limiting the spread of the disease in Curry County through early detection, monitoring, and eradication of symptomatic tanoak trees. Despite these efforts, the quarantine area in Curry County has expanded many times since 2001 from 9 sq. miles to over 500 sq. miles. The rate of disease spread increased most dramatically in 2014 requiring the quarantine area to nearly double in 2015.

Wood decay fungi enter trees primarily through wounds that expose sapwood or heartwood. Injuries from pruning, sunburn, light-ning, or cultivating equipment can expose susceptible wood. Large wounds and stub and horizontal cuts are often entry sites for decay fungi. Mycelial growth of the fungus proceeds with colonization and utilization of wood as a food source.

Decay is a white pocket rot of the heartwood of living trees, usually in the upper bole and large branches (unlike Inonotus root and butt rot, which always occurs near ground level). Annual conks appear on upper bole usually near knots, broken branches or pruning wounds. Conks are large (3.5 to 12 inches in diameter), thick, usually shelf-shaped, light brown initially, then dark brown. The decay consists of long white pockets (pipes) separated by darker and more solid wood. Conks deteriorate during winter to a very dark-brown color and usually fall from tree within a year of formation.

Oats ,"(Avena sativa)-Nematode, Cereal Cyst",,,,,
Oats ,(Avena sativa)-Red Leaf,"Barley yellow dwarf virus (BYDV) infects many cereals and grasses. Many grassy species in non-managed grasslands present in the Pacific Northwest are susceptible to BYDV, including: Achnatherum lettermanii, A. occidentale, A. thurberianum, Alopecurus pratensis, Bromus inermis, Danthonia intermedia, Elymus elymoides, Poa bulbosa, P. fendleriana, P. secunda, Sporobolus airoides, and S. cryptandrus. It is a problem worldwide on barley, oats, and wheat. Some hosts may not show visible symptoms of infection. BYDV is transmitted by several species of aphid, including the bird cherry-oat aphid (Rhopalosiphum padi), green bug aphid (Schizaphis graminum), corn leaf aphid (Rhopalosiphum maidis), and English grain aphid (Sitobion avenae). Virus strains transmitted primarily by Rhopalosiphum padi are now called Cereal yellow dwarf virus-RPV (CYDV-RPV), those transmitted by Sitobion avenae (formerly Macrosiphon avenae) are called MAV, and those transmitted by both aphid species are called PAV. Green bug aphid is not adapted to climatic conditions west of the Cascade Range.
Disease is more severe in cool, moist weather. In the Willamette Valley, Oregon, cool, moist conditions in spring or fall favor epidemics. Symptoms develop 2 to 4 weeks after infection when temperature is 68°F to 77°F and there is ample light. Damage is not always severe, it is influenced by the growth stage at infection; more severe symptoms occur when plants are infected as seedlings.


","Symptoms can be variable and may be confused with nutrient deficiencies or stress; presence of BYDV (or CYDV-RPV) needs to be confirmed by serological tests. A common symptom is reddish leaf tips.


","

1) Plant in late fall or early spring so the susceptible seedling stage is before or after peak flights of the insect vectors during warm summer months.

2) In affected plantings, reducing stress on plants by maintaining balanced fertility and adequate soil moisture can aid in minimizing losses.

Onion ,(Allium cepa)-Black Mold,"Aspergillus niger, a fungus common in soil and crop debris, affects a large number of fruit and vegetable species. The fungus may be seedborne. The disease attacks colored and white onions in storage and transit. It may do a lot of damage in storage if bulbs were at high temperatures for long periods (such as high-temperature drying in storage more than 2 to 3 days). No resistant cultivars are known.


","Infection usually is through neck tissues as foliage dies down at maturity. Infected bulbs are discolored black around the neck, and affected scales shrivel. Masses of powdery black spores generally are arranged as streaks along veins on and between outer dry scales. Infection may advance from the neck into the central fleshy scales. In advanced disease stages, the entire bulb surface turns black, and secondary bacterial soft rot may make the bulb soft and mushy. No external symptoms may be found with some bulbs.

Onion ,(Allium cepa)-Bulb Rots,"Several bacteria and a yeast produce bulb rots in onion. These include Bacterial Soft Rot caused by Erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora (syn. = Pectobacterium carotovorum subsp. carotovorum) and Erwinia chrysanthemi (syn. = Dickeya chrysanthemi), slippery skin caused by Burkholderia gladioli pv. alliicola (syn. = Pseudomonas gladioli pv. alliicola), sour skin caused by Burkholderia cepacia (syn. = Pseudomonas cepacia), Enterobacter bulb decay caused by Enterobacter cloaca, and yeast soft rot caused by Kluyveromyces marxianus var. marxianus. All these organisms are thought to overwinter in plant debris in soil or cull piles. All can enter the onion through wounds in the neck or bulb. Onion maggot activity can introduce and spread soft rot in the bulb. Warm, rainy weather, heavy irrigation, or flooded fields favor the diseases.


","Soft rot symptoms include fleshy scale tissues become water soaked and pale yellow to light brown, then become soft as the rot progresses. The entire bulb may break down, and a watery, foul-smelling viscous liquid may ooze from the neck when squeezed. If infected in the field, leaves will wilt and turn white.
Foliar symptoms of slippery and sour skin include a canker phase in which the bacteria generally cause a necrotic bleaching and collapse of one or two leaves. The pathogens progress down the leaf into the bulb, where they cause a pale yellow to light brown decay or breakdown. However, there may be no exterior symptom initially with slippery skin except a softened neck. When cut, one or two inner fleshy scales are seen to be soft and have a water-soaked appearance. Rot progresses from the top of the scales down without spreading to adjacent scales. The onion core may pop out when the base of the bulb is pressed. The entire internal bulb may rot, dry out, and shrivel.
Sour skin symptoms are similar to slippery skin, but affected scales are yellowish to light brown. Other Allium spp. may be affected. Enterobacter bulb decay symptoms are generally absent in the field, but appear after one to three months in storage. Internal scales have a light to dark brown discoloration and decay; externally bulbs appear healthy. The incidence of affected bulbs is generally less than 5%.
Yeast soft rot is similar to both soft rot and slippery skin.


","

1) Practice a 3-year or longer crop rotation. However, rotations of corn may increase populations of .  in the soil, and are not advised.

2) Avoid reuse of irrigation water and overhead irrigation.

3) Allow tops to mature and dry fully before harvesting.

4) Reduce mechanical injuries during cultivation and weeding.

5) Avoid bruising bulbs during harvest and handling.

6) Promptly and thoroughly cure onions before storing.

7) Store at 32°F and less than 70% humidity.

8) Some control can be obtained by using water from wells rather than from ditches.

Onion ,(Allium cepa)-Downy Mildew,"Peronospora destructor, a fungus-like microorganism that overwinters on infected plants or debris. There are no resistant cultivars. Many Allium spp. are affected including Egyptian onion, multiplier onion, Welsh or Spanish onion, chives, garlic, leek, and shallot. This disease is favored by cool (less than 72°F) and humid weather. Spores (conidia) can be wind-blown long distances and are produced at 43° to 80°F (optimum is 52° to 55°F). A pathogen cycle from infection to sporulation can be completed in about 2 weeks. When weather turns hot and dry, the sporulation dessicates and plants can partially recover with the production of new, noninfected leaves but disease will return if weather turns cool and moist again. Necks on bulbs of diseased plants can remain succulent and being infected by secondary pathogens after harvest.


","Slightly pale spots develop first on leaves or seed stalks, later taking on a light brown or purplish shade. As spots enlarge, often girdling the leaves, a grayish violet furry mold develops on the spot's surface. Plants may be dwarfed, distorted, and pale green if they are systemically infected. Plants often are not killed, but bulb quality is poor and often spongy. Lesion-weakened seed stems may break, causing seed to shrivel.


","

1) Plant only pathogen-free transplants, sets, and seed.

2) Practice a 3-year or longer crop rotation if possible.

3) Avoid poorly drained soils.

4) To minimize high humidity, plant in the direction of prevailing winds, avoid using wind breaks, and manage plant density and spacing.

5) Don't use overhead irrigation, use drip or sub-surface irrigation.

6) Destroy onion plant refuse and cull piles.

7) Avoid over-application of nitrogen as an overproduction of succulent leaves promotes disease.

8) Eradicate volunteer or wild  spp.

","During favorable weather, epidemics can build up quickly, affecting all of the foliage in several weeks. In western Oregon, when disease is present in the area and weather is favorable, well-times fungicide applications are needed prior to infection. The forecast program, DOWNCAST, can be used to optimize field scouting for spray timing but requires weather monitoring in the field.

Onion ,(Allium cepa)-Fusarium Basal Rot,"Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cepae is a soilborne fungus that can affect onion and other Allium spp. The fungus survives a long time in soil. Infection often is associated with pink root, maggots, or other insect injury.


","Bulbs may become infected at any point during their time in the field. Yellowing and browning of leaves begins at the tip and moves down. Plants exhibit weak growth and may wilt. Red-brown rot appears where roots are attached to the basal plate. Rot and discoloration usually affect the entire base and up into the bulb scales; affected tissue appears brown and watery when bulbs are cut open. Sometimes, a white moldy growth develops on the stem plate or between affected scales. Bulbs may appear normal at harvest, but rot may progress in storage.


","

Onion ,(Allium cepa)-Fusarium Bulb Rot,"Fusarium proliferatum, a fungus.


","This rot of onion bulbs in storage shows symptoms similar to the neck rot. Symptoms usually start at the neck and progress down along the fleshy scales, but the basal plate is not affected. Infected scale appears faint yellow, water-soaked, and translucent, later turning tan-brown and soft. Occasionally, a white mold grows between rotten scales. Frequently, the rot appears to progress along a single fleshy scale in the bulb, although rotting of all the scales in a bulb also has been observed. Usually, infected bulbs do not show any pronounced external symptoms or signs of the fungus.

Onion ,(Allium cepa)-Iris Yellow Spot,"Iris yellow spot virus (IYSV) is relatively new to onion production in the Pacific Northwest, first spotted on onion seed crops in the Treasure Valley around 1989. Overwintering onions fields were affected during the early years of the epidemic but by 2001, disease appeared in bulb crops across the Pacific Northwest. It has been reported on onions in across the United States and many other countries. This virus is known to infect members of the Allium group: onion, garlic, leek, chive, shallot, Oriental garlic (A. tuberosum), Welsh onion (A. fistulosum), and Allium vavilovii (a wild plant closely related to onion). A number of weeds and ornamentals may also be infected by IYSV, including: prairie gentian/lisianthus (Eustoma russellianum, E. grandiflorum), Dutch iris (Iris hollandica), Alstroemeria sp., amaryllis (Hippeastrum hybridum), Cycas sp., geranium (Pelargonium hortorum), Rosa spp., Scindapsus sp., and common purslane (Portulaca oleracea). Examination of weeds in Treasure Valley detected IYSV-infected redroot pigweed (Amaranthus retroflexus), puncturevine (Tribulus terrestris), kochia (Kochia scoparia), prickly lettuce (Lactuca serriola) and lambsquarters (Chenopodium album). In Georgia, twenty different weed species were positive for IYSV via serological testing, but only spiny sowthistle (Sonchus asper) infections were confirmed with RT-PCR. Tomato spotted wilt virus, a thrips-transmitted virus closely related to IYSV, has been reported on onion in Georgia, but disease symptoms appear very similar or identical to iris yellow spot.
This virus is transmitted by onion thrips (Thrips tabaci) but has not been shown to be transmitted by other thrips species such as the western flower thrips (Frankliniella occidentalis) or yellow flower thrips (F. schultizei). However, tobacco thrips (Frankliniella fusca) were recently shown to transmit the virus too. Transplants can be infected with IYSV as well as carry high populations of onion thrips. Studies have not shown this virus to be transmitted by onion seed.


","Affected onion seed crop plants have yellowish or tan diamond-shaped lesions on flower stalks. Some lesions have concentric rings; alternating green and yellow or tan. Infected flower stalks develop necrosis, die, and fall over. In onion bulb crops, diamond-shaped lesions may be rarely observed. Instead, necrotic areas develop on leaves, and can be elongated brown lesions or brown flecks that resemble thrips injury. Dried, elongated lesions that are characteristic in bulb crops, can be found on the youngest leaves. Severe pink root or other root rot can resemble the foliar problem but IYSV will not rot the bulb plate or roots. Elongated brown lesions can be colonized by saprophytic fungal and resemble purple blotch. Bulb size can be decreased, resulting in fewer colossal and jumbo grade bulbs. Affected fields may have diseased plants in clusters but sometimes nearly the entire field may be diseased, but the highest incidence of disease is often found near field edges. More severe disease may be observed in fields under stress.


","

1) Promote a healthy vigorous crop and avoid stress. Practice good fertility and water management.

2) Select varieties that are less susceptible to iris yellow spot. White varieties tend to be most resistant, and red varieties most susceptible.

3) Control volunteer and wild alliums.

4) Destroy onion cull piles.

5) Planting onion varieties that are less susceptible to thrips will not prevent disease but may slow spread in a field. However, there are no varieties that are resistant to thrips.

6) Plant as densely and uniformly as possible.

7) Overhead irrigation can provide some suppression of thrips and iris yellow spot.

8) Thrips migrate from drying wheat and bean fields to nearby onion fields. Field sites that are protected from these thrips sources may reduce virus transmission.

9) Plant virus-tested (and found to be free of viruses) transplants. Onion seeds will not carry IYSV.

10) Reduce or eliminate overwintering onions.

11) Isolate overwintering bulb and seed fields from other onion crops.

12) Eliminate weeds in and around onion fields.

","Monitor the population of onion thrips and control thrips with labeled insecticides. Consult the PNW Insect Management Handbook for currently effective materials.

Onion ,(Allium cepa)-Neck Rot,"Botrytis allii and B. aclada, fungi that overwinter on plant debris in soil, on infected bulbs, and as sclerotia in soil. The pathogens also can be seedborne. The disease is seen primarily in storage. Most common causes of severe losses are excessive nitrogen, which delays crop maturity; irrigation and/or rain late in the season; inadequate or improper curing; and improper storage. Infection is through neck tissue or wounds in bulbs. Some bulb infections may arise from symptomless leaf infections, but often the fungus directly enters the neck via airborne spores when onions are topped before soft, susceptible top tissues dry properly.


","Disease is more apparent after harvest, while bulbs are in storage. At first, soft neck tissue looks water soaked, and a yellow discoloration moves down the neck into the scales. Bulbs break down to a soft mass. A gray mold develops between the onion scales, later producing small to large black bodies (sclerotia), which develop as a solid layer around the neck.

Onion ,(Allium cepa)-Purple Blotch,"Alternaria porri, a fungus that overwinters on infected bulbs and debris in the field, can be seedborne in onion. Infection often follows injury caused either by other fungi, such as Botrytis, or by sand or dust during windstorms. Older leaves are more susceptible. Spores require rain or persistent dew to cause infection. Optimum temperatures are 77°F to 81°F. Almost no infection occurs below 55°F. The disease sometimes is severe in irrigated fields in eastern Oregon. 'Sweet Spanish' onions are very susceptible.


","A small, water-soaked lesion develops on leaves and soon develops a white center. Zones may appear as the spot enlarges and the lesion turns brown to purplish. Red or purple margins often encircle the purplish centers and are surrounded by yellowish tissue. In moist weather, the spot's surface usually becomes covered with a brownish black, powdery fungus growth. Leaves with large spots turn yellow and are blown over by the wind.
Bulbs may decay during and after harvest. Decay shows first as a watery rot around the neck and is particularly noticeable because of the yellowish to wine-red discoloration in the neck region. As the fungus moves through onion scales, the tissue turns yellow then a wine-red and dries to a papery texture.

The fungus can be seedborne and survives on debris and alternate hosts. Rain and wind can spread disease, as well as insects and irrigation water. Infection is favored by high humidity and temperatures between 73°F and 86°F.


","Curling, twisting, and chlorosis of the onion leaves occurs, roots may be stunted, and there may be an abnormal elongation of the necks. Bulbs may appear slender and can decay rapidly when stored. In greenhouse transplant production, roots of young seedlings may exhibit a dark rot with spore masses, especially when root tips protrude from the growing medium. Disease may be patchy or widespread.


","

1) Bury or flail infected crop residues after harvest to promote decomposition.

2) Avoid overhead water and over-watering, especially in transplant production.

","Fungicide applications are rarely required for this disease as it is not normally a problem.

Onion ,(Allium cepa)-White Rot,"A fungus, Sclerotium cepivorum, that produces hardy sclerotia, which may survive in soil for 20 to 30 years. Only Allium spp. such as onion, leek, and shallot are attacked. Sclerotia can infect plants from 12 inches below the soil surface. One sclerotium can infect a group of 20 to 30 adjacent plants. Fungal activity is favored by cool soils and is restricted above 75°F. Once the disease is in a field, it is very difficult to grow Allium spp. successfully. Disease spreads with infected sets or transplants, grazing animals, and movement of infested soil.


","Leaves decay at the base, turn yellow, wilt, and topple over. Older leaves collapse first. Roots rot, and the plant can be pulled up easily. Fluffy mycelium may be on remaining roots and bulb. Affected bulbs may become watery, and outer scales crack as they dry and shrink. Small sclerotia (0.02 inch, or about the size of a poppy seed) form in and on the surface of affected bulb parts, often around the neck. White rot can continue to decay infected bulbs in storage if humidity is not kept low.


","Idaho, Oregon, and Washington laws forbid importing bulbs or other material infected with white rot into some areas of each state.

1) Plant only pathogen-free material in pathogen-free soil.

2) Avoid moving sclerotia-contaminated soil into new fields by washing equipment before it enters another field.

3) If practical, dig out all plants in infested spots in the field and the healthy plants growing next to diseased ones. Remove some soil with both diseased and healthy plants. Dispose of the material in a landfill or hot composting operation.

","When soil in the top several inches remains above 75°F for at least part of the day through much of the growing season, fungicides will help to manage white rot. Under cooler soil conditions, the disease is only partly controlled even with the best chemical controls, and areas with cool soil conditions frequently become useless for producing all Allium spp.


1) Treating heavily infected areas of organic soils with tarped fumigation has helped reduce inoculum in infested fields but may not provide sufficient control alone.

Orchid,Bacterial Brown Spot,"Acidovorax avenae subsp. cattleyae (formerly Pseudomonas cattleya), a bacterium. Seedlings are infected through stomata, older plants through wounds. Bacteria in exudate spread from orchid to orchid by splashing water and from place to place with infected plants. Contaminated propagation tools are another way to transmit the bacteria. Warm, moist conditions and high nitrogen fertility favor the disease. Phalaenopsis is especially susceptible.


","Especially severe in California on Phalaenopsis seedlings, starting as a soft, water-soaked spot that later becomes brown or black cavity. These spots expand and can involve the entire leaf. On older plants, it starts anywhere on a leaf and finally reaches the growing point, where a mucilaginous exudate may be produced. Plants may be killed. On Cattleya, the disease advances more slowly and is limited to older leaves, producing clearly delimited, sunken, black spots; it is not fatal to the plant.


","Early detection of disease outbreaks through regular scouting is essential to minimize losses.

1) Avoid overhead irrigation that wets leaves or any practice that keeps plants wet for extended periods.

2) Provide good aeration to promote drying.

3) Keep benches clean and reasonably dry.

4) Reduce nitrogen and increase potassium fertility.

5) Separate diseased and healthy plants. Remove and destroy severely infected plants.

6) Disinfect cutting tools after cutting flowers or making divisions. Disinfect tools after each plant. Soak in trisodium phosphate or 10% bleach or Physan 20 helps. Use two knives so a worker can cut with one while the other soaks. When done with a plant switch one knife for the other and allow the used one to soak.

Orchid,Virus Diseases,"There are over 27 viruses reported to infect orchids. The two most important are Cymbidium mosaic virus, which has been found to infect 56 genera of orchids, and Odontoglossum ringspot virus (formerly the orchid strain of Tobacco mosaic virus), which has been reported from 20 orchid genera. Mixed infections of both viruses are common. Both viruses are transmitted by means not involving a vector: mechanical inoculation, division of infected plants, and contact between infected and healthy plants. A contaminated knife used in propagation or cutting flowers will transmit viruses to healthy plants. These viruses are resistant to degradation for long periods on tools and in the soil. These diseases are systemic: virus particles are in roots, bulbs, leaves, and flowers. Once infected, plants cannot be cured. The viruses are not known to be transmitted by seed.


","Cymbidium mosaic virus-on Cymbidiums, symptoms appear first on new growth 6 weeks after infection as small, inconspicuous, elongate, chlorotic areas. Symptoms become more pronounced when light and dark green areas eventually become evident. Brown streaks may appear after 3 to 4 months. On Cattleya leaves, sunken, brown to purple streaks or flecks appear; in severe cases, older leaves drop prematurely. Flowers of Cattleya-type orchids develop brown necrotic streaks or necrosis 5 to 21 days after they open and are most noticeable on white or lavender flower types. Symptoms on Phalaenopsis appear on new leaves as yellow, oval or elongated streaks or spots that may look water soaked. These turn purple-black and sunken with age. Lesions usually are only on the lower leaf surface. Vanda leaves develop chlorotic flecks.
Odontoglossum ringspot virus-causes flower color-breaking (especially in the flowers of lavender Cattleyas), chlorotic streaking, mosaic, or necrosis. It is symptomless in some cultivars. Oncidium flowers show no symptoms, but mature leaves develop round to irregular, slightly sunken yellow areas on both leaf surfaces. Spots darken with age. Cymbidium leaves show a diamond-shape mottle. Root tip necrosis is also a common symptom.
Symptoms may be more severe when both viruses have infected the same plant. Symptoms of either virus differ greatly from one orchid variety to another and can be confused with fungal disease problems. Vegetatively propagated plants may be infected but symptomless, so relying on symptoms to detect infection is not reliable. Only laboratory testing can make a valid diagnosis.


","Focus on preventing infections and good sanitation practices.

1) Use plants that have been tested and found free of all known viruses, such as those produced by meristem tip tissue culture. Also, seedlings are less likely to be infected than older plants.

2) Disinfect cutting tools after cutting flowers or making divisions. Disinfect tools after each plant. A soak in trisodium phosphate, or 10% bleach, or Physan 20 helps prevent viruses from spreading. Use two knives so a worker can cut with one while the other soaks. When done with a plant switch one knife for the other and allow the used one to soak.

3) Discard and destroy infected orchids.

4) Avoid reusing pots or trays from a previous crop for propagation. If pots must be reused then wash off all debris and soak in a sanitizing solution or treat with aerated steam for 30 min.

5) Some viruses are spread by insects so excluding them by using fine mesh screening in greenhouse openings may be useful.

Oregon Grape ,(Mahonia aquifolium)-Powdery Mildew,"The fungus Erysiphe berberidis (formerly Microsphaera berberidis) has been identified. This disease was observed widespread during the summer of 2002 on landscape plants in western Oregon and Washington. Only conidia were observed during the growing season. No chasmothecia have been observed. OSU Plant Clinic records indicate another sample of powdery mildew was observed in 1990 from Oregon. These fungi are obligate parasites that generally overwinter as chasmothecia. The fungus is favored in shady, humid environments; and also infects heavenly bamboo (Nandina domestica).


","The most common signs of this disease are white, powdery fungal colonies up to 1 cm in diameter on the upper surfaces of leaves. This fungal growth can easily be removed by wiping the leaf surface. Colonies frequently grew together and covered the entire leaf surface with a dense white powdery growth. There may be some yellowing of leaf tissue under the colonies. Heavily infected plants had reduced terminal growth and some deformation of new leaves.

Oregon Grape ,(Mahonia aquifolium)-Rust,"Cumminsiella mirabilissima and Puccinia graminis, fungi. These diseases can be spread through infected nursery stock. Cumminsiella mirabilissima has all spore stages on the same host, while P. graminis has grass alternate hosts such as wheat. The movement of rust resistant cultivars is not regulated.
Telia of C. mirabilissima occur on leaves in the fall and teliospores are abundant in March and April. Newly emerging leaves are infected by basidospores produced from teliospores. Pycnia then develop on the upper leaf surface from late April to mid-June. Aecia then develop on the undersides of leaves along veins, petioles and leaf margins or even on fruit, especially by the end of May. By late June uredinia can be found on the undersides of leaves. By fall telia are produced in the center of the uredinia.
In the laboratory, Oregon Grape can be an alternate host for Puccinia striformis f. sp. tritici, wheat stripe rust. It is not known if this can also occur in nature.


","Reddish spots on older leaves which develop dark centers (telia). Severe infections cause leaves to be puckered and distorted and may lead to premature defoliation. The aecidial stage, on younger leaves, is rare. On older leaves, once aeciospores are released, infected areas abscise and develop a shot-hole like symptom. The golden yellow margin of the peridia distinguishes C. mirabilissima from Puccinia graminis, which has a whitish or yellow margin.

Pansy ,(Viola spp.)-Leaf Spots,"Several fungal leaf spots have been reported from the Pacific Northwest including Ramularia agrestis, R. lactea, and Cercospora violae. Other fungi such as Alternaria sp. and Colletotrichum sp. (anthracnose) are also common leaf spot problems. Leaf spots are favored by warm, humid conditions especially later in the growing season during fall. Low nutrition levels also can favor these leaf spots. Cercospora can be seedborne.
Many abiotic leaf spots are sent into the OSU Plant Clinic, which are difficult to distinguish from biotic leaf spots. These abiotic spots will not be controlled with pesticides so a good diagnosis is important. A few bacteria and viruses can also cause leaf spots but are not as common.


","Cercospora violae produces large, fast spreading purple lesions on lower, older leaves that dry and turn necrotic. Spore production may make tan necrotic centers of the spots look blackened. Spots are irregular in both size and shape and do not have a sharp, rounded outline. The lower affected leaves may turn yellow and drop. May be easily confused with other leaf spots.
Alternaria sp. produces small circular spots with tan centers, surrounded by a purple-red halo. Can occur on various aged leaves.
Anthracnose is first seen as brown to tan spots appearing on the tip or edge of the leaf. The entire leaf may become blighted later. A black margin separates healthy tissue from infected tissue. Small, whisker-like black fungal structures (acervuli) containing the spores can be seen in the spots. Spots generally are on the lower foliage first. Petioles and stems may also be infected.


","Regular scouting will aid overall control efforts.

1) Rotate plantings in the garden.

2) Remove dead and dying foliage in and around the plants.

3) Avoid irrigation that lets plants remain wet a long time. Reduce humidity by using fans and ventilating the greenhouse after watering.

4) Maintain high light levels and good air movement around the foliage.

5) Maintain adequate fertility.

6) Use new or sterile pots and trays. Avoid reusing pots and trays. If reusing, thoroughly remove organic matter and soil, then wash with a disinfectant such as a 10% bleach solution or treat them with aerated steam at 122°F for 30 min.

Pansy ,(Viola spp.)-Powdery Mildew,"Podosphaera fuliginea and Podosphaera macularis (formerly Sphaerotheca macularis) , fungi reported from the PNW. The conidia are readily disseminated by wind. Chasmothecia develop within the external hyphae and form appendages late in their development. The disease is favored by shade or low light, warm days (60°F to 80°F) and cool nights. Overcrowding of plants is also favorable for disease development.

Pansy ,(Viola spp.)-Root and Crown Rot,"The OSU Plant Clinic has found several Pythium spp. and Phytophthora spp. (such as P. cactorum) associated with root and crown rots of pansy. These fungal-like organisms are favored by cool, saturated soil conditions that encourage spore production, spread and infection. Pythium has also been shown in other hosts to be a problem when soil media, high in soluble salts, repeatedly dries out and is re-wetted. They survive unfavorable periods in soil and infected plant debris. Under favorable conditions, spores germinate and infect roots. After infection, the fungus-like microorganism spreads mainly in the inner bark tissues of the root and stems. A thick-walled survival structure, oospores, are produced that can persist for several years. Movement of infected plants and/or soil can spread the organism.


","Lack of a functional root and crown system will result in a general yellowing, stunting, wilting, collapse, and death of the plant. Lower leaves may show symptoms first. Roots will be brown, water-soaked and mushy if they are present at all. Decay may continue up into the crown of the plant. Once girdled the plants die. Symptoms can occur any time from seed emergence to mature plants. Wilted plants may be easily pulled off the soil/media surface if crowns have rotted. Can be confused with black root rot or fungus gnat larval feeding.


","

1) Destroy infected plants and debris.

2) Inspect all plugs and cuttings for signs of infection.

3) Growing media pH should be 5.5 to 5.8 and temperature about 68°F. Check electrolyte concentration levels regularly. Note that pansys tend to naturally increase the growing media pH.

4) Do not overwater plants. The soil should dry only slightly between waterings.

5) Use new trays and pots with clean soilless media. If pots must be reused then wash off all debris and soak in a sanitizing solution or treat with aerated steam for 30 min.

6) Use sterile soil or potting mix to start seeds. Also disinfect any tools and equipment that might be used and contaminate the media.

7) Rotate plantings in the garden.

Pansy ,(Viola spp.)-Shoot Proliferation and Leafy Gall,,,,,
Pansy ,(Viola spp.)-Thielaviopsis Root Rot (Black Root Rot),"Thielaviopsis basicola, a soilborne fungus (long lived in soil without a susceptible host) with a wide host range including Alyssum, begonia, cyclamen, geranium, marigold, petunia, phlox, poinsettia, primula, snapdragon, sweet pea, and verbena. Plants are susceptible at all growth stages. In general, the disease is favored by high soil moisture content (particularly greater than 70%), high pH (greater than 6.5), and cool soils (55°F to 70°F). Pansy may be more severely affected when temperatures are warm to hot. Spores can survive longer than 12 months in some soils.


","Lower leaves of infected plants turn yellow. Plants are stunted, and severely infected plants die. Infections usually start at root tips and through root hairs. Root discoloration initially is brown and becomes a dark, flat black as abundant chlamydospores form on and in the root. This blackening may extend from the roots into the crown and lower stem. Rots tend to be firm instead of soft and mushy as with Pythium. The roots of infected plugs often fail to grow beyond the original plug after transplanting. Symptoms are often not expressed until plants are subjected to unfavorable environmental conditions. All ages of plants can be affected. Within a planting there might be an uneven stand or random pattern of healthy appearing and stunted plants.


","Sanitation is very important.

1) In the greenhouse:

1.1) Use soilless potting media or sterilized soil. Steam soil for 30 min. at 180°F.
1.2) Use new or sterile pots and trays. Avoid reusing pots and trays. If reusing, thoroughly remove organic matter and soil, then wash with a disinfectant such as a 10% bleach solution or treat them with aerated steam at 122°F for 30 min.
1.3) Growing media pH should be 5.5 to 5.8 and temperature about 68°F. Check electrolyte concentration levels regularly. Note that pansys tend to naturally increase the growing media pH.
1.4) Remove and discard all diseased plants; be careful not to contaminate adjacent plants.
1.5) Control fungus gnats and shore flies, which spread viable spores on their bodies and in their feces. Consult the PNW Insect Management Handbook for current control tactics.
1.6) After the production cycle, remove any remaining plants and disinfect the section.
2) In the landscape:

2.1) Plant only clean, pathogen-free plants in well-drained areas. Improve drainage if needed.
2.2) Plant resistant cultivars such as Clear Sky Primrose, Clear Sky True Blue, Clear Sky White, Crown Golden, Delta Blue W/Blotch, Delta Pure Violet, Delta White W/Rose Wing, Fama Blue Angel, Fama Dark-eyed White, Fama Love Me, Fama See Me, Fama Silver Blue, and Happy Face Yl/Blotch. 
2.3) Remove severely infected plants.
2.4) Rotate planting beds if replanting annually.
","Fungicides work best when used as a protectant in combination with cultural controls. Chemical control may require multiple applications. If the disease is noticed early, also treat with fungicides. Plants that develop good root systems before winter often tolerate the disease. Fungicides will not work well when the disease is severe. This pathogen can be difficult to control, and often the higher rate is more effective.

",,
Parsley ,(Petroselinum crispum)-Septoria Leaf Spot,"A fungus, Septoria petroselini, which can be seedborne. Infected seed can have reduced germination and emergence. The disease is wide spread on parsley. Avoid direct skin contact with infected plants because infected plants produce high levels of photo-carcinogenic compounds, which can result in rashes and blisters. Once this fungus is introduced to a field, it survives on non-decomposed plant debris and produces conidia under a wide temperature range (50°F to 86°F). Spread occurs under moist conditions (wind-driven rain, dew drips, irrigation) and by mechanical means (tools or workers). The pathogen may overwinter as diseased plants, which survive mild winters.


","Leaf spots start as small, grayish-brown, somewhat angular spots; small oval spots may be present on petioles. Tiny dark specks may be present on the upper leaf surface as pycnidia develop.


","

1) Use -free seed or hot-water treated seed (122°F for 30 minutes).

2) Rotate with unrelated crops, avoid umbelliferous plants (carrot, celery, celeriac, dill, fennel, parsnip, etc.). Four (4) year rotations are recommended for diseased fields; 2 to 3 years for non-diseased fields.

3) Incorporate crop debris to speed up decomposition.

4) Minimize leaf wetness periods.

Parsnip ,(Pastinaca sativa)-Itersonilia Canker,"The fungus, Itersonilia perplexans, is a common saprophyte on umbelliferous crops as well as some weeds and other cultivated plants including brassicas.  It overwinters as chlamdospores in soil or plant debris, on living parsnip roots, and can also infest seed. It spreads by wind as ballistospores, which die rapidly once in contact with soil microorganisms. Disease is favored by moist and cool conditions; 68°F is optimum for growth of the fungus.


","Reddish-brown to blackish cankers develop on the shoulders and crowns of roots; other microbes may subsequently invade and the entire root system collapse from rot. Itersonilia may also invade lateral roots at their base as well infect the aboveground portions of parsnip. Bases of petioles will develop dark lesions and leaves will exhibit brownish lesions with pale green halos, which may coalesce.


","

1) Plant resistant cultivars such as Andover.

2) Hilling up soil over parsnips' shoulders throughout the season will reduce disease.

3) Long rotations will reduce the population of chlamdospores in soil.

4) Select well-drained fields. Avoid fields with excessive soil compaction.

5) Burying infected plant debris will hasten breakdown of plant material and expose the pathogen to antagonistic soil microbes.

6) Control weeds and insect pests that damage roots.

Pea ,(Pisum sativum)-Aphanomyces Root Rot,"A fungus-like microorganism, Aphanomyces euteiches f. sp. pisi, that overwinters as thick-walled oospores, which can be spread by water, wind, infected plant debris, soil movement, or by tillage equipment. Oospores are produced within infected root tissue, which decomposes, releasing the oospores into surrounding soil. The fungus can infect and multiply in other legume roots, such as clover, alfalfa, lentil, Cava bean, and common bean. Even without other hosts, the pathogen can persist in infested soils 10 years or more, though the population slowly decreases with time.


","First are long, soft, water-soaked areas on the lower stem and roots; they rapidly turn tan and spread throughout the root system. Peas with severely infected roots pull out of the ground easily, and the outer portion (cortical tissue) is easily stripped away, leaving only interior tissues. Cortical tissues can be observed with a compound microscope, and diagnostic oospores (25 to 30 microns with an oil globule in the center) are readily detected. Top portions of infected plants are stunted and, in severe cases, wilt, yellow, and die prematurely.


","

1) Long rotations are the best way to manage the disease.

2) Green manure plowdowns of oat and  residues has helped somewhat to reduce inoculum levels.

3) Select well-drained fields. Avoid fields with excessive soil compaction.

4) Avoid fields heavily infested with the pathogen. Test soil to determine inoculum levels in a given field.

5) Do not plant late-maturing varieties in fields with a history of this root rot.

","Currently, no fungicide is registered as a seed treatment or for in-furrow application. Using Treflan as a herbicide can give some control. Small yield increases were reported in other states when label rates of trifluralin were used for weed control.

All these pathogens are transmitted by seed, so do not save seed from affected fields. P. medicaginis and M. pinodes can survive long periods in soil as thick-walled chlamydospores. Of the three, M. pinodes is by far the most aggressive and causes the most economic loss. Plants are more susceptible as they mature and are most susceptible from flowering to full maturity.


","Ascochyta blight can develop on seedlings in cool, wet weather. Stem tissue blackens and dies, beginning at the soil line and extending up the stem 2 to 6 inches. Young plants may die or survive in a weakened condition. Later in the season, severe leaf, stem, and pod spotting can occur with slight to severe losses in yield and quality.


","

1) Rotate out of peas at least 4 years. Do not include vetch or alfalfa in the rotation.

2) Use seed from pathogen-free fields; do not save seed from affected fields.

3) Burn or plow under diseased pea straw after harvest.

4) Plant midseason to late-maturing cultivars, or wait until warm weather to plant. Sometimes a 2-week delay in planting results in significantly less disease.

","If using nitrogen-fixing inoculants, add twice the amount of rhizobia inoculant and put inoculant in the seed furrow, not on seed; or add inoculum no more than 2 hours before planting.

Pea ,(Pisum sativum)-Bacterial Blight,"A bacterium, Pseudomonas syringae pv. pisi, that is internally seedborne and can survive in pea straw from one season to the next. This disease can be a problem in extremely wet springs where sprinkler irrigation is used and if seed for this year's crop came from a blight-infested field.


","Initial symptoms are small, water-soaked spots on leaves, pods, and stems. Lesions eventually coalesce, and leaves turn brown and die. Affected areas are translucent. Lesions often girdle the stem, killing tissues above. Tissue at the nodal area (where the stem leaflet is attached) can be severely infected also.


","

1) Thoroughly disinfect equipment used to harvest a blight-infested field if equipment will be used to harvest a clean field, because seed contamination can occur readily.

2) Use pathogen-free seed. Seed produced in dry areas without overhead sprinkler irrigation is usually free of blight. Using seed from the Willamette or Skagit valleys is not recommended.

Pea ,"(Pisum sativum)-Nematode, Cyst","The cyst nematode, Heterodera goettingiana, is an aggressive parasite that can be quite damaging to a pea crop. Cysts are the dead bodies of females and may contain up to 300 eggs. Cysts are very persistent in the soil, surviving more than 12 years, and can be spread by moving contaminated soil. Pea and fava bean are the main economic hosts. Certain vetches also can be hosts. Root invasion is promoted by cool soil temperatures (about 55°F). Thus peas planted early can be affected more severely than late plantings. Pea cultivars show little difference in their susceptibility to the cyst nematode.


","Infected peas are stunted with yellowing leaves, and leaves tend to point up. Foliage symptoms often are not evident until bloom, when yellowing spreads rapidly from the bottom of the plant to the top. Sometimes the color is a very bright yellow. Invaded plants lack fibrous roots and nitrogen-fixing nodules. Tiny (less than 0.5 mm) cream-color, lemon-shaped cysts can be found embedded in root tissue, but once cysts mature and turn dark brown, they detach easily from root systems and are difficult to detect. Initial damage to the field is restricted to small distinct areas, but with further cropping to pea, the areas expand.


","

1) Crop rotation effectively reduces soil populations because the nematode has a limited host range. Rotate 4 years out of host crops unless the field is infested at an economically damaging level; then, an even longer break is needed.

2) Avoid planting fava bean in fields with this nematode.

3) Plant later when soil temperature has warmed.

Pea ,(Pisum sativum)-Pea Enation Mosaic,"The Pea enation mosaic virus. At least 8 species of aphid can transmit the virus but the principal vector is the pea aphid, Acyrthosiphon pisum. After the aphid acquires the virus, it is 8 or more hours before it can transmit it to a pea plant, but the aphid retains the ability to transmit the virus for at least 24 hours, during which time it can fly or be blown long distances.
Plant hosts include chickpea, lentil, faba bean, broadbean, sweet pea, certain species of lupine; Hungarian, common, and hairy vetch; and several species of clover including Alsike, white, crimson, and subterranean. Weedy subterranean clover is the principal overwintering host in western Oregon. Alfalfa is not a host. This virus can be detected in seed but is not transmitted by seed.


","Mottling, crinkling, and stunting followed by tissue outgrowths on leaves and pods. Pods may be badly distorted.


","

1) Using resistant cultivars is the only satisfactory control. Since the cultivar Perfected Freezer 60 was developed, many good commercial cultivars have become available. The following are enation-mosaic-resistant cultivars:Edible pod- Green Sugar, Oregon Sugar Pod.Canners- Prospector, Corvallis.Freezers- Citation, Almoto, Freezer 50, Aspen, Mohawk, Aurora, Perfected Freezer 60, Trident, Knight.

2) If using susceptible varieties, planting before March 31 helps avoid aphid infestation. Controlling aphids helps in years when they are relatively few.

",,
Pea ,(Pisum sativum)-Pea Leaf Roll,"The Bean leaf roll virus, which the pea aphid transmits from alfalfa, the overwintering host, to peas. The disease is not seedborne. The disease virtually eliminated susceptible pea lines and cultivars in southern Idaho in 1980 and continues to be destructive in irrigated areas of Idaho, Washington, and Oregon.


","Infected plants develop a chlorotic mottling in terminal foliage, which may become bright yellow in time. Stunting frequently occurs, and plants may die if infections occur early in the season. Yields may be drastically reduced.


","Plant resistant cultivars. Many cultivars currently available have resistance to Bean leaf roll virus, and other resistant cultivars are being developed.

","Applying insecticide to control the insect vector may help some. See the PNW Insect Management Handbook for details.


",
Pea ,(Pisum sativum)-Pea Seedborne Mosaic,"The Pea seedborne mosaic virus spreads through infected seed. This virus was not known to be in the Pacific Northwest until 1968 and has not escaped into other crop or weed hosts in the United States. The pea aphid (Acyrthosiphon pisum), the green peach aphid (Myzus persicae), and the potato aphid (Macrosiphum euphorbiae) are efficient vectors. Although aphids do not retain the virus for long periods, natural spread over a distance of 400 meters has been observed. At normal aphid population levels, infection incidence can increase significantly during a single season of seed-crop increase. In extreme cases, all seeds of infected seed lots contain seedborne virus.


","The plant is slightly stunted and upper leaves are slightly rosetted and roll down sharply. Depending on the cultivar, rolled leaves may show no mosaic to slight mosaic symptoms. Pods may exhibit a slight mottling appearance. Seeds of infected plants may show slight brownish staining and/ or seed coat rupture (growth cracking). Seeds that look normal also may contain virus.


","

1) Isolate introduced pea cultivars and breeding lines from domestic nurseries and seed-increase fields.

2) Monitor principal or all seed lots for seedborne virus and destroy infected seed lots or divert them to nonseed use.

3) OSU has released resistant garden pea types.

","Apply systemic aphicides to nursery and small-increase plantings. See PNW Insect Management Handbook for details.

Pea ,(Pisum sativum)-Pea Streak,"Eleven reported viruses induce streak symptoms in peas. Alfalfa is the principal inoculum reservoir for streak-inducing viruses in eastern Oregon, eastern Washington, and Idaho. The two viruses that aphids transmit from alfalfa to peas are Pea streak virus and Alfalfa mosaic virus. Red clover is the inoculum reservoir for the principal streak-inducing virus of western Oregon and western Washington, Red clover vein mosaic virus. The pea aphid and probably several other aphid species can transmit all three viruses from reservoir hosts to peas.


","Gray, dark brown, or purple streaking of the stem. Leaves wither and die, and pods may be deformed. Plants may die back from the tip.


","

1) Avoid planting peas near alfalfa, which is a reservoir for aphids and the virus.

2) Removing volunteer red clover plants in pea fields in western Oregon and western Washington may be practical, but success depends on the incidence of red clover nearby.

","Controlling or reducing aphid populations does not control the viruses but may restrict their spread. See the PNW Insect Management Handbook for details.

Peach ,(Prunus persica)-Brown Rot,"The fungi Monilinia fructicola and M. laxa can incite both a blossom blight, a twig and branch dieback, and a fruit rot of several Prunus spp. including many ornamental and fruit trees. Fungi survive year to year on infected twigs, branches, old flower parts, or mummified fruit. Conidia are produced on infected plant debris in the tree when the temperature is above 40°F. A small, mushroom-like structure (apothecium) can be produced on fruit that drops to the ground. Wind and rain blow spores (conidia and ascospores) to healthy blossoms in spring to begin the infection process during wet weather. Infection will occur for M. laxa above 55°F. Infection may occur at any temperature above freezing with 24 hours wetness. Flowers can be blighted any time floral tissue is exposed but are most susceptible at full bloom. More spores can be produced on this tissue, initiating several more disease cycles during the spring.
Some infections may be symptomless until fruit begins to ripen. Ripening fruit also is highly susceptible to infection, and many more disease cycles can occur near harvest. Peach and nectarine fruit that fall to the ground due to lack of pollination, thinning, or overripeness can significantly increase inoculum and the amount of fruit rot at harvest. Fruit infected in the orchard may not show symptoms until it is in storage or in transit. High nitrogen fertilization also is associated with increased levels of brown rot.
Both fruiting and ornamental cherries, peaches, nectarines, prunes, plums, almonds, and apricots are susceptible. The disease is more a problem west of the Cascade Range. Surveys of eastern Washington packinghouses during 2000 and 2001 found very little brown rot on peaches and nectarines.


","Infected flower parts turn light brown and may develop areas of buff-color (M. fructicola) or gray (M. laxa) spores. Infected petals may look water soaked, which can be mistaken for frost injury. Flowers generally collapse as the fungus invades through the pedicel. Infected flowers often adhere to twigs and spurs through harvest or even winter. On peach, the disease continues into twigs or spurs. Lesions may remain discrete or may girdle the twig, causing all distal portions to die. Profuse gumming also may be in these areas. Again, buff or gray spores (in sporodochia) may develop on these necrotic twigs.
Fruit symptoms begin as small, dark spots that enlarge rapidly. Fruit remains fairly firm and dry relative to a watery rot caused by Rhizopus sp. Production of masses of buff-colored spores is equally rapid in the necrotic area. Peaches may have concentric rings of gray sporulation as the rot takes a few days to encompass the entire fruit.


","These must be supplemented by chemical control methods especially in the wettest areas such as west of the Cascade Range.

1) Remove and destroy infected twigs and branches in summer.

2) Remove and destroy all mummified fruit in and around the tree. Cultivating or burying old fruit before the growing season will not reduce the risk of this disease. However, removing fallen fruit (due to thinning or lack of pollination) can significantly reduce the amount of rot at harvest.

3) Control insects that could wound and injure fruit.

4) Avoid wounding fruit during harvest.

5) Cool fruit rapidly after harvest.

6) Use moderate amounts of nitrogen fertilizer.

7) A short (2.5 min) soak in hot water (122°F) has reduced postharvest decay in nectarines and peaches. Some additives have increased efficacy of this treatment.

","Apply fungicides during the blossoming period at early pink bud, full bloom, and/or petal fall to control the blossom blight phase. In California, one or two sprays are sufficient most years if a product with systemic (translaminar) activity is used. Fruit rot sprays can be applied before harvest if wet weather is expected. Tank-mix and/or alternate products with different modes of action to prevent the build-up of resistant fungi. Limit the use of any one group during crop production.

Peach ,(Prunus persica)-Crown Gall,,,,,
Peach ,(Prunus persica)-Cytospora Canker,"Cytospora cincta (sexual: Leucostoma cinctum), fungus, and the closely related C. leucostoma (sexual: Leucostoma persoonii). These are vigorous wound invaders (including wounds from sunscald and winter injury) that ramify throughout the bark and cambium and to a lesser extent the tree's structural wood. The firm, red peach cultivars such as Zee Lady and Sierra Rich are particularly susceptible.
Overwintering is in infected stems and stem debris on the ground. These fungi have a wide host range and can infect virtually all stone fruit and pome fruit trees. They can be devastating in cherry, peach, and apricot orchards. Conidia are produced in cherry and peach orchards in eastern Washington throughout the year and the inoculum concentration is highest during the spring and summer. Over-the-canopy and under-tree sprinkler irrigation can promote sporulation and disperse conidia. Cankers have been reported on apple in all Pacific Northwest regions, especially after severe winters. Various ornamental shrubs and trees are susceptible as well. All these hosts can provide overwintering sites. Cytospora fungi do not destroy the tree's structural strength, but other fungi (principally the genera Stereum and Polyporus) commonly invade the Cytospora infection sites and cause rapid wood rotting, which adds to the severity of the disease's effects.


","To the casual observer, the first evidence of infection usually is dead twigs. Leaves above stem infections droop and discolor through shades of green to various shades of brown; they remain attached, sometimes through the winter. These ""flags"" are caused by stem invasions that have raised cankers that girdle or nearly girdle the stem immediately below the flag. Canker surfaces develop raised pinhead-size pimples (pycnidia) in the bark of most smooth-bark cultivars, but these may not be readily visible in cankers on peach and cherry stems. Amber to orange, hair-like spore tendrils extrude from the pycnidia in humid weather. These break off easily and can be blown about, tracked around by insects, and splashed by rain. In very wet weather, an amber spore droplet instead of the spore hair may form on the pycnidia.
Cankers are small at first but slowly enlarge elliptically; sometimes they streak rapidly up and down the stem without immediate girdling. In late season, a callus forms at canker margins, and fungal activity resumes in spring. If branches and trees do not die outright, they look very ragged; this stage is often known as perennial canker. All cultivars are susceptible, but reaction to invasion varies widely. Weakened trees are always easy victims. In Idaho, this disease is the limiting factor in 'President' plum production.


","

1) Remove dead branches, cutting well below (at least 1 ft) any visible discoloration in the bark.

2) Do not establish new orchards close to or downwind from badly diseased orchards.

3) Treetop or other hedgerow pruning and overhead irrigation are not advised where the disease is a problem.

4) Take special care to avoid wounding trees during the growing season. Tractors and sprayers commonly inflict such wounds, as do shakers, ladders, and pickers' feet.

5) Control all insect and disease problems, such as brown rot of stone fruits, even in the first few nonbearing years.

6) Train trees properly.

7) Avoid rodent injury.

8) Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, nitrogen applications late in the growing season, or late-season cultivation or irrigation.

9) Paint the southwest side of tree trunks with white latex paint to avoid winter injury.

10) Prune as late as possible in the dormant season. Prune in dry weather.

11) Summer pruning can be helpful as long as wounds can be kept dry for 2 to 3 weeks.

12) Surgically remove cankers from trunks and scaffold limbs in summer.

Peach ,(Prunus persica)-Gumming,,,,,
Peach ,(Prunus persica)-Leaf Curl,"Taphrina deformans, a fungus. Spores of this fungus overwinter on bark, twigs, and old infected leaves. Infection occurs through bud scales in mid- to late winter just as buds begin to swell. Slow growing shoots and leaves can be infected during cool and wet growing seasons. Maximum susceptibility is between bud break and petal fall. In wet seasons, the fungus continues to cause slight summer infection, particularly west of the Cascade Range. East of the Cascade Range, after the initial spring infection and the shedding of diseased leaves, no further evidence of the disease is visible. Defoliation from severe infections weakens trees to the point that, if not controlled, they may die in 2 to 3 years.
Wetness from rain (or other factors) for over 12.5 hours is needed for leaf infection but only when the temperature is below 61°F during the wet period. Maximum infection occurs when trees are wet for 2 days or more, a frequent occurrence west of the Cascade Range. Although infected, symptoms may not appear if temperatures rise and remain above 69°F. Fruit are susceptible after petal fall until air temperature remains above 61°F. Rainfall of 0.5 inch and wetness of 24 hours is needed for fruit infection.


","The first visibly infected leaves are yellow to reddish and somewhat thickened and crisp in texture. As leaves expand they become deformed, puckered, and thicker than normal. The puckered areas are brightly colored with reds and/or purples and may continue to develop a dusty white coating of spores. Infected twigs occasionally are distorted, and a few fruit may show a reddish growth on the surface. Some infected leaves drop; others remain throughout the growing season, gradually becoming dark brown and heavily coated with spores. Ultimately, many infected leaves are shed. Trees die in 2 to 3 years from repeated defoliation.


","Resistant cultivars offer the best option for backyard growers and can be useful for commercial growers. Cultivars available today are selections from formal and informal breeding programs, chance discoveries by various growers, or propagated from trees planted by pioneers which have survived for decades. Many of these will do better if sprayed with fungicide the first year or two after planting. Trees may still die due to other problems such as shothole and/or bacterial canker. A report from North Carolina in 1981 found Redhaven and trees derived from Redhaven as tolerant but these trees are very susceptible in the PNW. The following peach or nectarine cultivars are offered by a variety of west coast nurseries as curl resistant: Autumn Rose, August Etter, Avalon, Avalon Pride, Charlotte, Early Charlotte, Early Crawford, Frost, Indian Free, Kreibich, Muir, Nanaimo, Oregon Curl Free, and Q-1-8.

","Two fungicide applications are recommended for western Oregon: at 50% leaf fall (late October), and again at delayed dormant (usually in late February, before floral buds open). A third application may be needed during the dormant season for shothole control depending on materials selected. In Washington, apply three (3) times 3 weeks apart starting in early January. East of the Cascade Range and in low rainfall areas, a delayed dormant application alone should be effective.

Peach ,(Prunus persica)-Nematodes,"There have been many nematode problems associated with peach production around the world. There are many nematode problems in the Pacific Northwest including root lesion, dagger and root knot nematodes. However, there has not been any published or concentrated effort to document nematode problems in peach orchards in eastern Washington or western Oregon. Few samples from peach orchards have come into the OSU Nematode Laboratory. It is suspected that nematodes are a problem that simply has not been investigated. In one case in western Oregon, nematodes were associated with a non-vigorous patch of problem trees in one orchard. Trees were said to have benefited from an application of fenamiphos.


",,,,
Peach ,(Prunus persica)-Plum Pox (Sharka),"Plum pox virus (PPV) of which there are several strains. The disease was found in North America for the first time in 1999 in Pennsylvania and has now been detected in New York and Michigan as well as Ontario and Nova Scotia, Canada. Periodic surveys for the virus since 2000 have not found the virus in the Pacific Northwest nursery industry or Oregon's cherry orchards. After 10 years of eradication efforts, Pennsylvania was declared free of the virus in 2009 meeting the requirement of three consecutive years of testing negative. Michigan has also eradicated the disease. There are 7 strains known including PPV-D, which is the one found in the US. Globally, PPV is the most economically important virus of stone fruits.
PPV infects all Prunus fruit tree species, almond, and many ornamental trees. In Europe, wild Prunus species are reservoirs of the virus. Herbaceous hosts include an array of common weeds, such as white clover and nightshades. The virus can survive in the roots of rogued infected trees and can also spread by natural root grafting. Suckers produced from the remaining roots of rogued infected trees carry the virus and therefore must be removed if control is to be achieved.
PPV is transmitted by aphids in a nonpersistent manner and is retained by the aphid for no more than a few hours. Aphids appear to spread the virus not to immediately adjacent trees but to trees several spaces away. Systemic spread of the virus within a tree may take several years; in the meantime, the virus may be distributed very irregularly. Seed transmission in Prunus is known not to occur with the D strain, but there are some reports of seed transmission with the M strain. Long-distance spread is through distribution of infected budwood and nursery stock. Experimental transmission from infected fruit to hosts has been shown and could be a possible mechanism for long distance spread.


","Many trees do not show symptoms for up to 4 years after initial infection. Symptoms can be severe on many cultivars of apricot, plum, and peach trees. However, the type and severity of symptom development depends on the particular cultivar. Sweet and sour cherries were confirmed as natural hosts. Symptoms may appear on leaves or fruits of infected trees and are particularly evident on leaves in spring when chlorotic spots, bands or rings, vein clearing, and even leaf deformation is evident. Infected fruits show chlorotic spots or rings, and diseased plums and apricots are deformed with internal browning of the flesh and pale rings or spots on the stones. Much of the affected fruit drops prematurely, 20 to 30 days before the normal maturity date, and fruit that does remain on the tree lacks flavor and is low in sugar. Symptoms; however, are highly variable.


",,,
Peach ,(Prunus persica)-Powdery Mildew,"Podosphaera pannosa (formerly Sphaerotheca pannosa)  and Podosphaera clandestina, fungi that overwinter on infected twigs, shoots, and buds of stone fruits. Leaves are infected as they emerge from the bud. Colonies that develop on leaves produce airborne conidia that infect other leaves and fruit. Fruit are susceptible to infection until pit hardening. Roses are a host of P. pannosa and may increase disease pressure if planted nearby.
A disease in peach called rusty spot is caused by Podosphaera leucotricha. This is the same fungus that causes apple powdery mildew, which is unable to sustain an infection on peach. Peach fruit are most susceptible to P. leucotricha from shuck split, when the ovary is first exposed, until fruit are 2 cm in diameter. Peach or nectarine fruit closest to apple orchards with powdery mildew had a higher incidence of rusty spot. Removing adjacent apple orchards has reduced rusty spot in peach orchards.


","Terminal growth, including twigs, leaves, and shoots, shows a white fungal growth in spring and early summer, often resulting in twig distortion. On fruit, powdery mildew develops as a fine white fungal growth on the peach surface. Later in the season, affected peaches take on a whitish russeted appearance and may also be malformed and scabby. Nectarine fruit is very susceptible.
Rusty spot is characterized by small, round, orange-tan lesions, which gradually enlarge as the fruit enlarges. Fungal mycelium is rarely seen in these lesions.

Peach ,(Prunus persica)-Russeting,"Many factors can cause surface scarring or russeting, including insect damage and mechanical rubbing of young fruit. Thrips nymphs hatch and feed in numbers on tiny fruit, often under the drying calyx or flower parts. Their feeding scars the surface of the fruit which may cause fruit deformity as the fruit enlarges. The most significant damage occurs during and shortly after pollination. Lygus and stink bugs also can damage fruit at this time. Damage is sporadic and occasional in the Willamette Valley of Oregon. It may be in only a portion or along the border of an orchard. Earwings can also be a problem with nectarine scaring.


","Young fruit may be scarred, russeted, dimpled, distorted or pock marked.


","

1) To prevent driving thrips into the trees, do not disc the cover crop when trees are in bloom.

2) Control insects just after pollination. See the  for details.

Peach ,(Prunus persica)-Shothole,"Thyrostroma carpophilum (formerly Wilsonomyces carpophilus), a fungus that overwinters on infected peach (stone fruit) buds and twigs. When moisture is continuous for at least 24 hours and temperatures are above 36°F, infection can occur in the dormant season. When temperatures are higher during the growing season, shorter periods of moisture are required for germination and infection; for example only 6 hours are needed at 77°F. Spores spread primarily by splashing water and can remain viable several months when dry. Under favorable conditions, spores can be produced from infected buds and stem lesion throughout the growing season. Most cultivars of peach, nectarine, apricot, and almond appear to be very susceptible. Cherry and plum are less susceptible and show only leaf and fruit symptoms when extended periods of moisture are present in late spring and early summer. Can be a problem in eastern districts when over-the-canopy irrigation is used for frost protection.


","Leaves develop small, round, tan-to-purplish spots that are seldom larger than 0.25 inch wide. Tissue becomes somewhat raised and scurfy and often drops out in dry, warm weather, producing a shothole effect.
Fruit symptoms are similar and can be accompanied by a clear, gummy exudate. Small red fruit spots may be numerous and slightly sunken.
On current-season and 1-year-old fruiting wood, infections consist of round, reddish spots, which are slightly sunken. Fruit buds often are killed, and fruiting wood may be badly damaged or girdled. Rough, smoky-appearing cankers up to 2 or 3 inches long develop on 2- to 4-year-old wood. These are a source of the overwintering spores. On apricot, buds often are killed, but very few twig infections occur.

Peach ,(Prunus persica)-Split Pit,"A physiological problem. The exact causes of pit breakage are unknown. Low temperatures and/or freeze damage during flowering and early fruit development may be factors. Fruit of most early peach cultivars enters the final swell of growth before the pit is completely hardened. As the fruit enlarges rapidly, stress exerted by the expanding flesh causes (or enhances) much of the pit fracturing. Because most early varieties are cling types, the strong attachment of flesh to pit probably enhances the forces exerted on the immature pit by the expanding flesh. Cultural practices that enhance fruit size (such as thinning, nitrogen application, girdling, and irrigation) usually increase the level of split pit. If freezes excessively reduce fruit loads, generally pit breakage increases. Excessive rain in the latter stages of fruit growth is another uncontrollable variable that aggravates pit breakage.


","The term ""split pit"" normally refers to the opening of the pit at the stem end of the fruit. This split becomes evident in the third stage of fruit growth, usually referred to as the final swell. Fruit generally develops rot problems much more quickly than sound fruit, and the risk is higher that disease will spread more rapidly from split-pit fruit to other fruit.


","

1) Leave heavier crops on problem cultivars.

2) Do not apply excessive nitrogen too close to harvest.

3) Reduce or eliminate future plantings of the more troublesome cultivars.

Peach ,(Prunus persica)-Virus Diseases,"There have been very few peach virus or virus-like diseases from Oregon diagnosed by the OSU Plant Clinic. Prunus necrotic ringspot virus has been found. Peach wart disease (unknown) and X-disease (Candidatus Phytoplasma pruni) have also been found.It was suspected that some peach samples had Peach calico (Peach latent mosaic viroid) or Prune dwarf virus but were not confirmed.


",,,,
Peach ,(Prunus persica)-Wood Decay,"Most fungi that cause extensive wood decay of stone fruit trees are classified in the phylum Basidiomycota. These fungi produce various basidiocarps, such as mushrooms and conks, containing basidia. Basidiospores are forcibly discharged from basidia and usually are disseminated by air currents. Wood decay fungi enter trees primarily through wounds that expose sapwood or heartwood. Injuries from pruning, sunburn, lightning, or cultivating equipment can expose susceptible wood. Large wounds and stub and horizontal cuts are often entry sites for decay fungi. Mycelial growth of the fungus proceeds with colonization and utilization of wood as a food source. Basidiocarps develop after extensive colonization of the substrate in a suitable environment and under suitable physiological conditions. Asexual spores are not commonly produced.
Wood decay is generally observed in older trees after extensive fungal colonization, but it also occurs in young trees. Decay fungi frequently function as secondary invaders following a succession of microorganisms, including bacteria, yeasts, and other fungi. Decay in a single tree may be caused by more than one fungal species.


","Two types of wood decay occur in living trees: white rots and brown rots. White rots cause moist, soft, or spongy wood that is of a lighter color that sound wood. All major structural components of the cell wall-cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin-are degraded. The strength of white rotted wood decreases only in advanced stages of decay.
Brown rots of wood are brown, dry, and crumbly, with longitudinal and transverse cracks. Most of the cell wall polysaccharides are degraded, but the lignin component is unchanged or slightly modified. The strength of brown rotted wood is significantly reduced or lost entirely shortly after decay is initiated. These rots usually occur in exposed wood and can cause extensive damage, resulting in structural failure.
Wood decay leads to limb breakage, uprooted trees, trees broken at the soil line during windstorms or decreased tree vigor, and dieback.


","

1) Help prevent wood decay by using cultural practices that promote tree growth and vigor while minimizing injuries that expose wood.

2) Irrigation water, especially from sprinklers, should not wet the trunks.

3) Cultivation and mowing equipment should not injure the roots, crown, or lower trunk.

4) Make pruning cuts adjacent to, but not into, the supporting branch; prune when the branches are small, to enhance callus formation and wound healing.

5) Tree paints for protecting wounds must provide complete coverage and maintain an intact layer to be useful. Sealants often crack and expose unprotected wood to decay fungi.

Peach ,(Prunus persica)-X-Disease,"A phytoplasma that is east of the Cascade Range and is spread by four leafhopper species, of which the most important is the geminate leafhopper, Colladonus geminatus. Sweet and sour cherry also are susceptible to this organism. Candidatus Phytoplasma pruni is the suggested scientific name for the Western X disease phytoplasma. Fruit quality and yield are reduced.
Several Prunus species are hosts including cherry, plum, bitter cherry and choke cherry. There are many similarities with Peach yellows phytoplasma and Peach rosette phytoplasm, both of which are quarantined against being brought into the PNW from Eastern States.


","Near the end of May, a few leaves show an irregular yellow spotting, which later may turn reddish or brown. Leaves tend to roll; infected tissue becomes necrotic and ultimately drops out in a rather ragged or shothole pattern. As the season advances, foliage from the stem base up shows these symptoms and drops to the ground; only young growth remains at the branches' tips. Spread appears to be from limb to limb throughout the tree. Fruit is smaller, lacks flavor, and may shrivel prematurely. Trees typically die in 4 to 8 years.


","

1) When X-Disease first appears, spray trees thoroughly to kill the vectors, and then remove infected trees. However, if many trees are infected, this may not be economically advisable because infected trees still can produce fruit that looks healthy.

2) Remove wild chokecherry () or other hosts that can be a reservoir of the pathogen in the vicinity.

Pear ,(Pyrus spp.)-Anthracnose (Bull's-eye Rot),,,,,
Pear ,(Pyrus spp.)-Cork Spot,,"Depth and shape of the corking spots will give diagnostic clues as to the cause. Cork spot (calcium deficiency) has spots deeper into the fruit than a Brown Marmorated Stink Bug could reach with its mouthparts (1 cm or less from the surface). Stink bug caused cork spots are shallow and have irregular (but not square) shape. The boron deficiency spots tend to be square and flat-bottomed.


",,,
Pear ,(Pyrus spp.)-Crown Gall,,,,,
Pear ,(Pyrus spp.)-Decline,"Pear decline is caused by Candidatus Phytoplasma pyri transmitted by pear psylla or by grafting infected stock to healthy trees. The pear psylla acquires the phytoplasma after a few hours of feeding and remains infective for the rest of its life. Grafting and budding can also transmit this phytoplasma. Decline is much more prevalent on trees with rootstocks of Pyrus ussuriensis or P. pyricola than on trees propagated on domestic P. communis roots. The pathogen survives from season to season in the roots of infected trees. The phytoplasma population in the aboveground portions of the tree fluctuates through the year. The pathogen does not survive in aboveground phloem elements in late fall and winter but rebounds from root reservoirs once new phloem tissue is made in the spring.
The dwarfing Quince rootstocks have been highly tolerant of this disease. For example, Comice on quince BA-29 has been very successful. The cultivar William is incompatible with quince and will weaken and die a few years after planting. The Farold series 40, 69 or 87 (also known as 'Old Home x Farmingdale') are a highly tolerant alternative when grown on well-drained soils.
Quick decline symptoms result from additional stress acting directly on roots (usually Phytophthora or Pythium root rot). Leaves turn red early due to starch accumulation in the upper tree.


","Pear decline is characterized by two phases. Quick decline is where trees wilt, scorch, and die in a few weeks. It is often preceded by slow decline and reddening. This quick decline occurs on very susceptible rootstocks such as P. ussuriensis and P. pyricola. Slow decline is where trees lose vigor over several seasons during which foliage gets sparse with little or no terminal growth and leaf size is reduced. Fruit set and size also decline. Slow decline occurs on more common rootstocks such as P. communis, P. calleryana, P. pyrifolia, P. betulaefolia, and Cydonia oblonga.
An abnormal, early red leaf coloration has been observed frequently on affected trees due to root damage. Reddening may or may not accompany either slow or quick decline. Reddened leaves may curl downward with margins rolled upward. Leaf veins may be thickened with crinkled leaves that drop sooner than normal leaves. Reduced root systems may occur with all phases of the disease.
Graft incompatibility, root rots, and winter injury can be mistaken for pear decline.


","

1) Use resistant or tolerant rootstocks.

2) Remove infected trees from nurseries and young orchards.

3) Collect hardwood cuttings or scion stock in the winter or early spring.

4) Use the best orchard management practices, including the best possible insect and disease control, irrigation, drainage, fertilization, and pruning.

5) Control pear psylla. See the for details.

6) When grafting Asian pear trees over to European () cultivars, graft below the union of the Asian pear with its rootstock to avoid creating a highly decline-susceptible tree.

Pear ,(Pyrus spp.)-European Canker,,,,,
Pear ,(Pyrus spp.)-Fire Blight,"Erwinia amylovora, a bacterium that overwinters in cankers on infected pear, apple, and some ornamental trees. Risk of infection increases with the number of more active ""holdover"" cankers in an orchard. Insects, pruning tools, and splashing rains spread this bacterium. Bacteria enter healthy, main bloom or rattail blossoms through the stigma, nectary, anthers, and sepals. A temperature of 65°F or higher in a 24-hour period plus a trace of rain or high humidity (greater than 65%) is necessary for infection. Flowers, which are open for up to 3 days, support rapid growth of the bacteria while older flowers do not. Vigorously growing shoot tips, young leaves, and wounds also can be infection sites. Entrance into healthy appearing leaves and shoots may be through the base of epidermal hairs. Symptomless pears are not a source of the pathogen, which is rarely detected (1 out of 5,600 fruit) as an epiphyte on commercially-produced fruit.
Primary insect vectors include ants, flies, and wasps. Aphids, flies, ants, leafhoppers and tarnished plant bugs have been implicated In the spread of fire blight. Flies and ants are attracted to the bacterial ooze and can then carry it to uninfected blossoms. Bees do not feed on bacterial ooze but can visit infected flowers and spread bacteria to uninfected flowers.
All important pear cultivars are susceptible to fire blight, including Bosc. Fire blight also severely attacks apple, cotoneaster, photinia, pyracantha, hawthorn, quince, and mountain ash. Fire blight may be very serious some years but appears hardly at all in others. It is sporadic in Milton Freewater, Hood River, and Medford, OR and in Yakima and Wenatchee, WA. Since the mid-1990s, the disease has become very important to apple growers because susceptible cultivars have been planted widely. It is not common in Oregon's Willamette Valley and may be confused there with Pseudomonas blight. In a ""fire blight year,"" young trees, especially those trained to a central leader, can be severely damaged.


","During moist periods in the bloom season, spurs, blossoms, and twigs may become infected, developing a darker, water-soaked appearance. They turn brown to black and rapidly wilt and die. Infected blossoms frequently are distorted. A tan-yellow bacterial exudate (ooze) often appears where infection occurs.
Cankers develop on trunks, limbs, and the graft union. Cankers are at first water soaked, later brownish red, and ultimately dark brown or black. Bark covering the cankered area is sunken, rougher and separates from injured tissue. Severe cankers girdle and kill infected limbs. The cultivar Concord may show trunk cankers first before symptoms on flowers or shoots.
Other problems that can be confused with fire blight include Pseudomonas blossom blast, Nectria twig blight, pear dieback caused by Phomopsis sp., and twig borer beetle damage.


","This disease can cause serious losses and all personnel from growers to extension agents should have a full understanding of management tactics and apply them rigorously. Use an integration of many tactics, from sanitation to timely application of chemical to biological products, to manage this disease.

1) Remove and immediately burn all traces of blight as noticed. Thorough blight cutting requires training and good equipment (such as special blight-cutting or scraping knives), a supply of sterilizing solution, and several trips through the orchard.  Use lots of sterilizing solution on all tools and large cuts. Soak tools in solution after every cut. Use 10% Clorox (which is corrosive), 70% ethanol, 70% isopropanol (rubbing alcohol), or Pine-Sol. If used as a soak, change solutions every 2 to 3 hours. Do not cut when trees are wet from rain, irrigation, or dew.

1.1) If early bloom is severely infected, delay cutting until you determine the infection's extent. Cut out late bloom infections as soon as noticed. In spring and summer, cut at least 12 to 15 inches past any visible discoloration. 
1.2) Scout orchards for symptoms 7 to 10 days after hail or severe storms.
1.3) In fall, immediately after harvest, or during the dormant season inspect the orchard and remove all infections missed earlier. Cutting 4 to 6 inches beyond discoloration is enough at this time.
1.4) Cauterizing cankers using a hand-held propane burner has been used with some success.
2) Prevent excessive shoot and sucker growth by using moderate amounts of nitrogen fertilizer. Nitrogen applications can be split using half the recommendsed amount before growth starts in the spring. If fire blight is not a major issue the rest of the nitrogen can be applied after bloom.

3) Remove late blooms during fruit thinning. If feasible, remove blooms before they open the first year after planting.

4) In young orchards with susceptible cultivars and/or rootstocks, remove and destroy severely infected young trees. Replanting is more effective and less risky in the long run. Also, check new nursery trees for any symptoms of fire blight.

5) Scion wood should not be collected from trees with fire blight or within 60 feet of trees with fire blight.

6) Remove nearby landscape, such as hawthorns, or fence-row trees that can be a source of inoculum.

7) Avoid overhead irrigation. Reducing irrigation in a vigorous orchard with fire blight strikes may slow development of blight observed on new shoots. In arid areas, reducing irrigation in the spring helps reduce the potential for dew formation on flowers.

8) Some minor cultivars are resistant including Blake's Pride.

","Integration of chemical and biological tactics has worked well in the PNW. Keeping bacterial populations low during bloom, with various products and timing antibiotic applications to coincide with infection periods, has been a successful strategy in the PNW. Use a delayed dormant application of a copper-based product if fire blight was active in your orchard last year. Use biological materials as trees go into bloom and again at full bloom supplemented with an antibiotic. Use antibiotics when infection periods are detected with the Cougarblight program. Continue with an antibiotic program during rat tail bloom (also called second bloom or scattered bloom).


1) Delayed dormant sprays of copper compounds plus oil can delay and/or reduce inoculum production in holdover cankers missed after pruning. The use of copper-based products at this time is not always effective and was found in Israel to not reduce disease intensity during bloom. Work in the 2010's in California showed less infection during bloom. Group M1 fungicides.

Tank-mix or alternate bactericides to prevent or delay development of resistant bacteria. Time initial and subsequent sprays according to one of several forecasting systems, or local recommendations, or as soon as possible after severe spring storms. Applications greater than 24 hours before or after infection give poor control. Good spray coverage is important in getting good results.

1) BlightBan A506 ( strain A506) at 5 to 7 oz/A. Use at 20% bloom and again at 50% bloom. Best when used at the beginning of a blight infection period. It is incompatible with ziram, mancozeb, Aliette, and copper products but is compatible with some antibiotics. Do not use oxytetracycline within 5 to 7 days of applying BlightBan. This product alone will not control fire blight and must be integrated into a regular antibiotic schedule. It reduces strikes only by 40 to 50% but may be useful any time antibiotics cannot be applied within 48 hours of an infection period, such as in large blocks that take a long time to spray. Poor to fair control. 4-hr reentry The addition of chelated iron such as Sequestrene 138 at 1 lb/100 gal water in a tank-mix with BlightBan improves disease control over BlightBan alone. This is a safe and legal use for all states for apples (Golden Delicious, Rome Beauty and Gala) and pears (Bartlett, Bosc, and Comice); however, this use would remove the registrant from any legal/financial responsibility.

2) Bloomtime Biological FD ( strain E325) at 0.33 to 0.44 lb/A depending on gallonage. Use at 15% to 20% bloom and again at full bloom to petal fall. Do not apply after fruit set. Do not use with copper-based products or within 7 days of oxytetracycline. The unformulated active ingredient works well. This product alone will not control fire blight and must be integrated into a regular antibiotic schedule. Poor to good control. 4-hr reentry.

3) Blossom Protect () at 2.5 lb/2 A plus 17.5 lb Buffer Protect. Use at 15% to 20% bloom and again at full bloom to petal fall. If crop load thinning in early bloom with lime sulfur or ATS, delay first use of Blossom Protect until full bloom. May enhance russeting on some cultivars when applied late bloom. Use in conjunction with other control tactics such as thorough sanitation and antibiotics. Not compatible with many pesticides or additives, a compatibility list is available. Do not use following an application of a copper-based product or severe russeting will occur. Excellent control. 4-hr reentry.

4) BotryStop (i U3 strain) at 2 to 4 lb/A. Keep refrigerated before use. Unknown efficacy in the PNW. 4-hr reentry.

5) LifeGard WG ( isolate J) at 4.5 oz/100 gal water. Unknown efficacy. 4-hr reentry.

6) Serenade ASO ( strain QST 713) at 2 to 4 quarts/A. Active ingredient is basically an antibiotic so use late in bloom like you would oxytetracycline. It does not work if used like the biologicals early in the bloom season. Fair to good control. 4-hr reentry.

Pear ,(Pyrus spp.)-Fruit Russeting,,,,,
Pear ,(Pyrus spp.)-Leaf Blister,,"Large, light-green to yellow, irregular blisters form on the upper surface of leaves. A white fungal bloom develops on the concave underside. The leaf blisters caused by eriophyid mites (pear rust mite, Epitrimerus pyri) are more common, smaller, can be reddish and are numerous on the leaf surface.

Pear ,(Pyrus spp.)-Nectria Canker (European Canker),,,,,
Pear ,(Pyrus spp.)-Pacific Coast Pear Rust,"Gymnosporangium libocedri, a fungus. The rust fungi in this genus alternate between a conifer and roseacous host. Similar spore stages on pear are produced on apple, crabapple, hawthorn, mountain ash, quince and serviceberry (Amelanchier). The alternate host is the incense cedar (Calocedrus decurrens). The disease has been reported commonly from the Willamette Valley of Oregon, but outbreaks are economically significant to orchardists only every few years. Oriental and European cultivars are susceptible. (Note that G. asiaticum occurs on Asian pears.) 'Winter Nelis' is severely affected while under the same conditions 'Bartlett' is less affected. Some years 'Bartlett' can be severely affected but other pears show even greater symptoms under the same conditions.


","Pear fruit are malformed while young and drop from the tree. Bright-yellowish to orangish spots with numerous cup-shape pustules (aecia) develop over the fruit surface. Spots fade and darken as the fruit matures or falls off the tree. Green shoots and leaves also are attacked but not as frequently. Symptoms are most obvious after flowering but before July.
The disease on Incense cedar is called broom rust because it causes a witches' broom. Telia develop only on the leaves and are not very noticeable until during spring rains when they look like orange jelly. Trees with many infections decline and may die.


","Remove alternate hosts around the orchard.

","The following do not specifically list this pear rust but can be used to control the disease. Apply during the time cedar trees have swollen, orange telia in early spring. In western Oregon this is usually during bloom.

Pear ,(Pyrus spp.)-Powdery Mildew,"Podosphaera leucotricha, a fungus that overwinters in terminal buds of apples. Other host plants include crabapple, and quince. Pear orchards are at a higher risk of disease development if planted next to apple orchards. The disease is important on the cultivar d'Anjou where a smooth fruit finish is highly desired. Leaf and terminal infection seldom cause economic losses except in the nursery. 'Bartlett' rarely has a problem with this disease.
Infected terminal buds of apple and sometimes pear develop into shoots covered with conidia. Spore dispersal is favored by wind and warm temperatures but inhibited by leaf wetness.


","On pear fruit, white mycelium is visible until early June when it sloughs off, leaving a russeted patch where cells died. The russeted area expands as the fruit enlarge. Infected terminal buds have an open pointed appearance.

"
Pear ,(Pyrus spp.)-Pseudomonas Blossom Blast and Dieback,"Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae, a bacterium. Rain and low temperatures, especially frost-inducing temperatures during bloom, increase incidence of blossom infection. Two common genetic traits increase the bacteria's ability to cause disease. Most produce a powerful plant toxin, syringomycin, which destroys plant tissues as bacteria multiply in a wound. Bacteria also produce a protein that acts as an ice nucleus, increasing frost wounds that bacteria easily colonize and expand.
Severe on wood-'Old Home' and Asian pear cultivars.
Severe blossom blight-'Packham's Triumph', 'Bartlett', 'Eldorado', 'Anjou', and 'Bosc'.
Less severe blossom blight-'Comice', 'Forelle', red 'Anjou', and red 'Bartlett' cultivars.
Apple is not as susceptible and generally does not need control.


","Infection may cause blossom blast, leaf spots, dieback of twigs and spurs, dormant-bud death, and bark cankers. At first, bark cankers are light brown, irregular patches on limbs. Later, outer bark and some underlying tissues may wholly or partly slough away.
The blossom blast may closely resemble that of fire blight but is different in that necrotic tissue seldom extends more than 1 to 2 inches into the spur and never involves a bacterial exudate. The blossom blast also may resemble that caused by Botrytis. May also cause canker on young trees.


","

1) Protect from frost using a variety of methods including overhead irrigation or wind machines.

2) Prune Asian pear cultivars in summer.

3) Remove and destroy infected tissue.

Pear ,(Pyrus spp.)-Replant Disease,,,,,
Pear ,(Pyrus spp.)-Scab,"Venturia pyrina, a fungus that overwinters in infected fallen leaves and, in some areas, on pear twigs. Twig infection occurs sometimes in the Mosier and Medford, OR areas and commonly west of the Cascade Range and coastal British Columbia. Fallen leaves produce ascospores in the spring. Spores are generally released during rainstorms over a 3-to-4 month period but primarily during bloom. Infection occurs when leaves are wet for 10 to 25 hours and symptoms are seen in 2 to 3 weeks. Conidia are produced in these new scab spots and can infect healthy foliage or fruit.
The cultivars Forelle and Bartlett Red Sensation are very susceptible. The disease does not cause apple scab, nor can the apple scab fungus cause pear scab.
Scab on Asian pear is also caused by a different species, V. nashicola, that has not been reported in the Pacific Northwest. There are some reports of scab on Asian pear in the Willamette Valley of Oregon, but these have not been confirmed.


","In spring, sooty spots with a soft velvet look appear on young fruit, stems, calyx lobes, or flower petals. Young infected fruit frequently drop or are misshapen. Scab spots expand with growth until halted by dry weather or sprays. Old fruit infections often crack open. Cracks are surrounded by russeted, corky tissue and then an olive-color ring of active fungus growth. If fruit is infected late in the season, about 2 weeks before harvest, pinpoint-size scab spots often show up in storage a month or more later.
On leaves, olive-black spots expand with leaf growth but often cause the leaf to twist abnormally. Infected twigs show small blister-like infections the size of a pinhead and develop a corky layer. Many twig infections are sloughed off during the summer season.


","

1) Apply nitrogen (urea) to leaves in fall to enhance decomposition of fallen leaves and make them more palatable to earthworms.

2) Shred fallen leaves with a flail mower to help speed decomposition of infected leaves.

3) Pruning out infected twigs also offers some benefit.

4) Applying dolomitic lime after leaf drop in fall to increase soil pH also helps reduce inoculum the next spring.

5) Reduce irrigation sets so leaves do not stay wet for extended periods of time. Use sprinkler heads that do not wet the foliage of the tree or use drip irrigation.

","Spray delayed dormant compounds before bud scales drop. Apply in season sprays at preblossom (prepink), pink, calyx, and first cover. Forecasting systems are available to time sprays to control pear scab. Forecasting is especially useful in arid areas with few infection periods. Resistance to Group 3 and 11 fungicides have been detected in the Medford, OR area. In Pennsylvania, not using dormant copper sprays, older trees, larger orchards, orchards with ≤10 cultivars, and application of >4 DMI sprays were positively correlated with the incidence of resistant apple scab isolates.


1) A delayed dormant application is effective against twig infections in orchards that had a lot of disease the previous year(s).

Pear ,(Pyrus spp.)-Sprinkler Rot (Phytophthora Fruit Rot),"Phytophthora spp., a soilborne fungus-like microorganism frequently carried in irrigation water. There were 9 different distinct taxa of Phytophthora pathogenic to pear found in irrigation water canals in north central Washington. Fruit rot has caused significant loss of fruit where irrigation water wetted fruit, usually on lower branches or from overhead irrigation for summer fruit cooling. As little as 1 hour of fruit wetting is enough time for infection.


","Firm, tan-colored, rotted spots on areas up to more than 1 inch in diameter on the fruit. Older infections can cause the whole fruit to rot on the tree. Can be confused with fire blight on immature pears but is lighter in color and soft to the touch. Some years, disease also may spread to fruit pedicels and a little way into first-year wood, causing a dieback that resembles fire blight.


","

1) Use low-angle or microsprinkler heads, that do not let water wet fruit, under trees. Drip irrigation can also be used.

2) Reduce the length of irrigation sets.

","Copper metered into water at 1 part per million. Higher concentrations will russet 'Anjou' pears.


",
Pear ,(Pyrus spp.)-Stony Pit,"A virus disease that is graft transmissible. There is no indication that an insect vector spreads the virus. The disease is sporadic in the Pacific Northwest, apparently in conjunction with specific climatic conditions. Cultivars react differently; only Bosc shows all types of symptoms. Cultivars showing mild symptoms include Clairgeau, Old Home, Packham's Triumph, and Waite. Occasionally, the cultivar Packham's Triumph fruit show severe symptoms. Studies in the Netherlands suggest that the disease is associated with Apple stem pitting virus.


","Under specific climatic conditions, the disease appears in noncertified 'Bosc', to some extent in 'Anjou', and occasionally in 'Comice' and 'Bartlett', causing a fruit pitting and deformity. In 'Bosc', a roughened bark condition may also accompany the pitting. There is excessive stone-cell development below the pits in the skin. Pitting may be severe in 'Anjou' but is less common than in 'Bosc'.
Light or moderate fruit symptoms may be confused with pitting from tarnished-plant bug damage, stink bugs, boron deficiency, or corky spot. Stink bug feeding damage is a depressed blemish with a puncture site that is always visible in the center leading to a brown cork-like area in the flesh.


","

1) Remove and replace with a tree that has been tested and found free of all known viruses.

2) Establish new plantings only with certified virus-tested trees.

Pear ,(Pyrus spp.)-Storage Rots,"There are many storage disorders caused by abiotic problems beyond Bartlett Decay described below. Many of these are covered in a separate section on Apple-Storage Problems.
Bartlett Decay-If the water is warm (caused by running fruit picked on a hot day) or the SOPP concentration is too high, or the rinse is inadequate, burning at the lenticels can result.
Most of this section will cover storage rots caused by fungal pathogens.
Blue and Gray mold-The two major postharvest rots of pear and apple are blue and gray mold caused by Penicillium spp. and Botrytis cinerea, respectively. Blue mold infections occur mainly through wounds that occur prior to storage. The fungus penetrates through these wounds, bruises, and lenticels on overripe fruit in storage. Delays in cooling fruit after harvest can increase risk of this rot. High nitrogen levels and tree vigor also contribute to disease development. Gray mold survives on organic matter and fruit left in the orchard. This fungus generally infects fruit before harvest.
Bull's-eye rot is frequently caused by the fungi Neofabraea perennans and N. vagabunda (formerly Neofabraea alba) in the Pacific Northwest. Neofabraea kienholzii and N. malicorticus can also occur on apple. Infections occur in the orchard from cankers caused by the pathogen in the previous season. Infections can occur between bloom and harvest, but susceptibility increases as the growing season progresses. Rain or overhead tree irrigation during the growing season can increase risks of inoculum spread and rot development. 'Bosc' is amongst the highly susceptible cultivars.
Alternaria rot-Alternaria alternata infects fruit in the orchard through skin breaks or areas weakened by sunburn or bruising. This remains a minor pathogen but its frequency can vary between seasons.
Phacidiopycnis rot-Phacidiopycnis piri has been found in all major pear-producing areas of the Pacific Northwest, however, its importance is not well known and can vary from one year to another. It is associated with dead bark, cankers, and twig dieback of pear trees. Spores from pycnidia are the main type of inoculum in the orchard. Infection of fruit occurs in the orchard between bloom and harvest but symptoms develop in storage. Preventing infections close to harvest is recommended.
Sphaeropsis rot-Sphaeropsis pyriputrescens infects fruit in the orchard but symptoms develop postharvest on 'd'Anjou' pear and several apple cultivars. Although found at low frequencies, the disease is relatively widespread throughout central Washington but not reported yet in Oregon. The fungus can cause twig dieback and can survive on dead fruit spurs and mummified fruit on apple trees and crabapple pollinizers such as Manchurian.
Mucor rot-Mucor piriformis spores survive in the soil in organic matter and are transported to storage rooms on bins left in the orchard for several days. Cross-contamination can occur when fruit are drenched in flume water.
Cladosporium rot-Cladosporium herbarum.
Storage scab-Venturia pyrina.
Sprinkler rot-Phytophthora cactorum is spread through irrigation water in orchards and can be become problematic under continuous wet conditions that are not common the Pacific Northwest.
Coprinus rot-Coprinopsis psychromorbida (formerly Coprinus psychromorbidus) .
Side rot-Cadophora malorum (formerly Phialophora malorum). This minor rot has been reported in Oregon and elsewhere on 'Bosc' as well as on other cultivars in Europe.
Phacidium rot-Phacidium lacerum was found causing storage rot on apple and pear in Washington. Symptoms occurred on fruit inoculated in the field after 3-months cold storage.


","
Blue mold-Light brown lesions that eventually become soft, watery, and covered with large numbers of green then blue spores.
Gray mold-Infections are spongy in consistency and become covered with fuzzy gray mycelium, which can eventually produce copious amounts of spores. The disease can spread from diseased to healthy fruits forming nest-like pockets of rotted fruit.
Bulls'-eye rot-spots with light-brown sunken centers and a dark-brown halo. The rot has a firm and mealy texture. Rot does not spread from one fruit to another.
Phacidiopycnis rot-Rot may develop at the calyx- or stem-end and is rarely associated with wounds. Decayed areas appear water-soaked in the early stages and turn black as the rot develops but the margin remains water-soaked. Decayed fruit eventually look like a ripe avocado. The disease may be confused with gray mold but has a firmer consistency and a translucent margin compared to a brownish margin for gray mold.
Sphaeropsis rot-a firm, brown rot develops from the calyx- or stem-end. The fungus may form pycnidia on the decayed lesions as the rot advances. Decay develops along the vascular tissue and causes the flesh to become brown. Sphaeropsis rot can be distinguished from gray mold by its strong odor.
Cladosporium rot-dark brown, water-soaked spots. Can be confused with side rot.
Storage scab-small, light brown, sunken spots.
Sprinkler rot-lesions are light brown and soft with a pungent, phenolic odor.
Fire blight-lesions are dark brown and hard.
Coprinus rot-large depressed spots with light-brown centers and a thinner, dark-brown margin. A white cobweb-like growth on the surface can cause a nest or cluster of rotted fruit. At its early stage, the disease can be mistaken for bulls'-eye rot.
Side rot-dark spots indistinguishable from Cladosporium rot.
Phacidium rot-A stem-end rot, calyx-end rot and wound-associated rot. Lesions are light brown and decayed tissue is spongy to firm.


","A combination of techniques will aid in overall control.

1) Avoid use of over-tree evaporative cooling or use it in such a way that fruit is not wet for extended periods of time.

2) Use low-angle sprinkler nozzles.

3) Maintain good in-row weed control; mow grass between rows.

4) Use foliar nutrient sprays before harvest. Calcium-based products may help reduce the impact of some diseases. Nutraphos-24 applied at 15 lb/A 3 weeks before harvest reduced blue mold in 'Anjou' pears by 50%. Summer applications of calcium chloride, three (3) times 2 weeks apart, help reduce both blue mold and side rot.

5) Use a minimal amount of nitrogen fertilizer.

6) Harvest at proper maturity, and instruct harvesters on the proper technique for removing fruit from the tree. Late harvest can result in increased decay rates.

7) Clean fruit bins before filling, and keep soil off the bottom. A hot water pressure wash or steaming can help clean bins. Plastic bins are better than wooden bins. Clean storage rooms of all debris well before filling and treat surfaces with a disinfectant.

8) Harvest and cool fruit quickly. Keep bins out of sun.

9) Avoid or minimize injuries at harvest and during handling by smoothing orchard roads and driving slowly. Paying pickers by the hour rather than by the bin has resulted in fewer stem punctures and fruit injuries.

10) Controlled-atmosphere storage, especially with low (1%) oxygen, reduces the incidence and severity of some rots.

11) Do not return cull fruit back into the orchard.

","Use a combination of pre and postharvest fungicides. Fruits should be thermo-nebulized (fog or aerosol) or drenched with fungicides shortly after harvest to minimize postharvest rots. Rotate fungicides from different FRAC groups to avoid using the same fungicide twice on the same fruit from pre- to post-harvest. Resistance to fungicides has been detected.


1) Fungicides applied during the growing season, especially before heavy rains preharvest. Use fungicides from different FRAC groups that might be used post-harvest. Resistance to fungicides has been detected in stored fruit.

1.1) Merivon at 4 to 5.5 fl oz/A is labeled for blue and gray mold. Do not use with EC or oil-based products. May be used day of harvest. (Consider other products if it was used in the orchard for disease control.) Group 7 and 11 fungicide. 12-hr reentry.
1.2) Ph-D WDG at 6.2 oz/A for Alternaira or gray mold. May be applied on the day of harvest. Group 19 fungicide. 4-hr reentry. 
1.3) Pristine at 14.5 to 18.5 oz/A within 14 days of harvest for gray mold and blue mold. Do not use more than two (2) consecutive applications or more than four (4) times/year. Can be used day of harvest. (Consider other products if it was used in the orchard for disease control.) Group 7 + 11 fungicide. 12-hr reentry.
1.4) Topsin M WSB at 1 lb/A for pears and at 0.75 to 1 lb/A for apples. Do not use more than 4 lb/A/season or within 1 day of harvest. Do not use at any time in the orchard if your packing house uses a benzimidazole (such as Mertect or Decco Salt 19) postharvest. Group 1 fungicide. 2-day reentry. 
1.5) Ziram 76 DF at 6 lb/A for gray mold. Do not use within 14 days of harvest. May irritate the skin of people who harvest fruit. Group M3 fungicide. 48-hr reentry.
2) Thermo-nebulization where compounds such as fludioxonil (eFog80, ScholarEZ) or pyrimethanil (eFog160) are applied by chemical companies to rooms filled with fruit. Thiabendazole (TBZ) is commonly applied together with fludioxonil to enhance protection against bulls' eye rot. It is recommended to fill rooms as quickly as possible and apply the fungicide shortly after harvest to obtain better control.

3) Drenched or spray with a fungicide suspension immediately after harvest. Make sure all fruit surfaces are covered well. Drenches tend to be better than sprays. Rotate fungicides from different FRAC groups every year. Avoid using the same fungicide twice on the same fruit. Resistance to fungicides has been detected in Washington.

3.1) Academy packing-line spray at 16 fl oz/200,000 lb fruit or as a 15 to 30 second dip at 16 fl oz/100 gal water. Use agitation to keep in suspension. Registered for several diseases. Group 3 + 12 fungicide. 
3.2) Captan 50 WP at 2.5 lb/100 gal water. Group M4 fungicide.
3.3) Judge 50 WDG as packing-line spray at 1 to 1.5 lb/8 to 20 gal water for 200,000 lb fruit or as a 20 to 30 second dip at 1 to 1.5 lb/100 gal water. Registered for Botrytis management. Group 17 fungicide. 
3.4) Penbotec 400 SC at 16 to 32 fl oz/100 gal water for dip (wash) tanks or drenchers. Soak for at least 30 seconds then drain fruit. Concentration should be maintained at 500 to 1000 ppm. (Consider other products if Inspire Super was used in the orchard for disease control.) Registered for blue and gray mold. Group 9 fungicide.
3.5) Scholar SC at 10 to 16 fl oz/100 gal of an appropriate carrier for bin, truck or in-line dip/drench. Use at 16 to 32 fl oz/200,000 lb fruit as an in-line aqueous or fruit coating spray. Do not expose treated fruit to sunlight. Registered for both apple and pear. Group 12 fungicide.
3.6) Sodium hypochlorite (Agclor 310 at 1.125 to 1.5 gal/1000 gal water for apples or 1.5 to 2.25 gal/1000 gal water for pears). Filtration of the wash water will help reduce the total amount of chlorine needed. 
3.7) Sodium orthophenylphenate (Stop Mold, Steri-Seal, or Deccosol). Use Deccosol 122 at 1 gal/44 to 56 gal water. Can also be applied using thermal fogging under SLN WA-080013.
3.8) Thiabendazole (TBZ) still provides efficacy against bulls' eye rot and other pathogens that have not develop resistance. Resistance to TBZ in gray and blue molds is common in Washington and Oregon. Group 1 fungicides.Decco Salt No. 19 at 575 g/250 gal water. Decco Salt No. 38 at 575 to 1,150 g/300 gal water. Washington only. Mertect 340 F at 16 fl oz/100 gal water.Shield-Brite TBZ is also registered. See label for details. 
4) Fruit Wraps can be used for several storage problems of pear.

4.1) Burrows E Wrap can be used for scald control. Do not use on pears that have been treated with ethoxyquin and do not re-use wraps.
4.2) Pear Wrap III is treated with both ethoxyquin and copper. Do not re-use wraps.

Pear ,(Pyrus spp.)-Trellis Rust (European Pear Rust),"Gymnosporangium sabinae (sometimes referred to as G. fuscum), a fungus. The disease affects pear and juniper, which is the alternate host of the fungus. The disease was established only in southern British Columbia and Contra Costa County, CA. Then it was found on pear in the Bellingham, WA area just south of the Canadian border in 1997. Since then the disease has been commonly found on pear leaves in western Washington. Found in western Oregon on pear starting in 2016 (Benton and Marion counties only).
Telia are extruded from Juniper galls during wet weather in early spring. Basidospores are dispersed at night to rosaceous hosts such as pear causing an annual infection. Aecia form on the underside of leaves late summer and into the fall. Aeciospores are dis-persed to junipers causing a perennial infection.


","Yellow to bright orange leaf spots appear on leaves, fruit, twigs, and branches of pear. Occasionally, infected fruit mummifies and falls to the ground. Leaf lesions can grow together and cover much of the leaf surface when the disease is severe. These symptoms occur in spring and can be confused with other rust species. Unlike other rusts, acorn-shape aecia form on the lower leaf surface. They are up to 6 mm high and rupture along lateral slits. Aecia can develop by mid-June and into the fall and again another growing season if on perennial parts of tree.


","

1) Eliminating either host is the only practical cultural control. If pear is the important plant, remove all juniper from a 1000-ft radius.

","The following do not specifically list pear rust but can be used to control the disease.

Pear ,(Pyrus spp.)-Vein Yellows (Red Mottle and Sooty Ringspot of Quince),"Vein yellows reportedly is incited by a long, flexuous virus that is identical to or very closely related to Apple stem pitting virus. The virus is found in many noncertified European pear cultivars, many of which show few if any symptoms. Vein yellows virus and Red mottle virus are strains of the same virus.


","Symptoms on sensitive cultivars develop on leaves in spring and are most conspicuous by midsummer. General weathering of leaves in late summer and autumn makes symptoms less conspicuous. Early symptoms appear as small, pale yellow spots or blotches, usually associated with the finer veins and sometimes banding them. Symptoms are more pronounced on young (nursery) trees than on old (orchard) trees. Symptom severity can vary from year to year. It is not known whether the red mottling and flecking symptom usually associated with vein yellows is caused by certain strains of the virus or by a distinct virus. Symptoms of red mottle are most pronounced in late summer and autumn. They appear as scattered dark red spots or flecks usually associated with the finer veins. Nursery pear trees with vein yellows and red mottle have a yellowish, unthrifty appearance. Trees infected with severe strains of vein yellows are about half the size of healthy trees. Most Oregon-grown cultivars do not show leaf symptoms.


","

1) Use scions and rootstocks that have been tested and found free of all known viruses.

2) Heat treat infected tissue at 37°C and then propagate by meristems or shoot tips.

",,
Pear ,(Pyrus spp.)-Virus and Virus-like Diseases,"There are several virus and virus-like diseases of pear. In some cases the exact cause or even virus has not been determined. Different described diseases may be due to the same virus. The following are reported to occur on pear and include Apple chlorotic leaf spot virus, Apple mosaic virus, Apple stem pitting virus, Apple scar skin viroid, Pear blister canker viroid, Peach latent mosaic viroid, and Candidatus Phytoplasma pyri (decline). Some viruses severely reduce tree growth and fruit production. Trees that have been tested and found free of all known viruses show more vigor and growth and come into production sooner than diseased trees. Virus spread is believed to be only through affected scion wood. There is no evidence to suggest a ""natural"" spread-by insects or other vectors-in orchards. Decline, however, is spread by the pear psylla.


","Viruses reduce tree vigor and production and sometimes cause fruit malformation, such as with stony pit, or leaf symptoms.


","

1) Use clones that have been tested and found free of all known viruses to produce nursery stock and to top-work virus-free trees.

2) Remove infected trees.

"Pear, Asian ",(Pyrus spp.)-Dieback,"The bacterium Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae is much more severe on Asian pear cultivars (Pyrus pyrifolia and P. ussuriensis) than on European pears (P. communis) in western Oregon. This is due in part to the earlier bloom season for Asian pears. Early blooming trees are also more likely to be damaged by spring frosts, which provide an infection route for the bacteria. The cold, wet weather during spring is ideal for spread of the bacteria. Young, vigorously growing trees are more susceptible than older trees. Also, trees with a heavy bloom appear to be more prone to blossom blast than trees with fewer blossoms. Dormant pruning during cold, wet weather may allow the bacteria to enter wounded stems, resulting in stem dieback. Two common genetic traits increase the bacteria's ability to cause disease. Most produce a powerful plant toxin, syringomycin, which destroys plant tissues as bacteria multiply in a wound. Bacteria also produce a protein that acts as an ice nucleus, increasing frost wounds that bacteria easily colonize and expand.
The Chinese cultivars (P. ussuriensis selections) Hang Pa Li, Hansen Siberian, Harbin, Mien Suan Li, Ping Ding Li, and Shu Li are very prone to frost damage and dieback symptoms. The Chinese white pear cultivars Ya Li and Tse Li are somewhat resistant even when damaged by frost. The Japanese cultivars Hosui, Kosui, and Shinseiki are very susceptible to blossom blast and prone to stem dieback. The cultivar Nijisseiki (20th Century) is less susceptible.


","While Pseudomonas typically causes only a blossom blast in European pears and rarely spreads into the wood, blossom blast in Asian pears often runs down the stem, killing entire branches. Shoots become water soaked and then turn black as the bacteria move down the stem. Young trees may be killed to the ground.


","

1) Prune Asian pears during dry periods in the winter, or delay pruning until spring or summer. Summer pruning also helps slow down overly vigorous trees.

2) Thinning flower spurs during dry periods reduces bloom, helps improve fruit size, and may reduce the amount of disease observed.

3) Avoid planting Asian pears in frost pockets or low-lying areas.

4) Do not fertilize late in the growing season or encourage late-season growth, which is more susceptible to winter injury.

5) Remove and destroy infected branches.

","Resistance to the active ingredients in these products has been detected in the Pacific Northwest. Limit the use of any one group during crop production.

Penstemon,Root Rot,"The OSU Plant Clinic has found Phytophthora spp., Rhizoctonia spp., and Fusarium spp. associated with root rots of Penstemon spp. grown in Oregon. Native plant nurseries in Idaho have reported problems with root rot on this crop as well. These soilborne fungi are favored by cool, wet soil and/or media. They can become a problem if growing media becomes contaminated or a pathogen is introduced on seeds or in irrigation water. These fungi are able to survive for various periods as resting spores or as mycelium in soil and residual host tissues, and they can be seedborne. They also can persist in old, reused containers.


","A root rot caused by Phytophthora citrophthora had stunting, leaf discoloration, wilting and rotting of roots and the root crown. Plants eventually died.


","Penstemon does well in dry, sunny well drained sites.

1) Use new pots, trays, or treat any reused items with a disinfectant, use steam, or solarization techniques (such as with anti-condensation film) to clean them.

2) Use soilless growing media that is stored under cover in a concrete bay or in some other clean and sealed container kept dry, cool, and in a low-light environment.

3) Growing media could be treated by steam (140°F for 30 minutes), solarization (double-tent at 160°F for 30 minutes or 140°F for 1 hour), or chemically. Storage area surfaces should be easy to clean and disinfest. This could include metal or plastic bins, trailers, trolleys, in bags on a sealed surface, or racks under cover.

4) Use ground sources for irrigation and avoid surface water sources for propagation of the crop.

5) Good drainage and water management are essential components of a management plan. Ensure growing media and holding areas are well drained.

6) Monitor soluble salt concentrations regularly adjusting media to an EC of 1.0 to 1.25 and keep pH between 5.8 and 6.2.

7) Remove diseased plants immediately and carry out rigorous hygiene measures to prevent further spread.

8) Remove crop residue and old or low-quality plants that will not be marketed as they can become sources of inoculum.

9) Replace wood benches or potting tables for ones made of plastic or wire that will facilitate cleaning and disinfestation.

","Chemical treatment should be preceded by an accurate diagnosis since most of the chemicals are not effective against all pathogens that might cause damping-off. Penstemon is not on any of these labels so be sure to try on a few plants first before general use.

Peony ,(Paeonia spp.)-Anthracnose,"The fungi Gloeosporium sp. has been found in Oregon and Colletotrichum sp. was found in Washington. These pathogens generally overwinter in leaf litter; therefore, infested debris can serve as an important source of initial inoculum. Prolonged periods of leaf wetness can also favor disease development.


","Lesions and cankers on all aboveground parts of the peony. On stems, cankers are elongate and gray in color and often cause severe twisting or curling of the stem. Pink-colored fruiting structures (acervulus) can sometimes be observed in the cankers. Foliar leaf spots and infections of flowers and flower buds are, similarly, gray in color and can cause irregular growth of plant tissues or interfere with flower development.

Peony ,(Paeonia spp.)-Botrytis Blight,"The fungi Botrytis paeoniae (sometimes called early blight or bud blast) and B. cinerea (sometimes called late blight). Additional species have been found in the PNW including B. pseudocinerea that is resistant to fenheximide. Inoculum of B. paeoniae will be from previous or nearby peony crops while that of B. cinerea could be from any of its over 250 hosts. These fungi are favored by wet, rainy conditions that result in free moisture on plant surfaces. The first conidia arise from sclerotia that have overwintered on the surface of decayed peony foliage. Subsequent spores are produced on infected plant material. Spores can be blown by wind, splashed by rain, or carried on tools. Conidia enter the host through natural openings, directly, or through wounds. The fungi can colonize peony petals and other plant tissues. These tissues, especially petals, can be the source of the fungus when they fall onto healthy leaves. They will form black, overwintering structures called sclerotia, which can survive in plant debris left over or mulched around the bases of plants. There is a wide range of susceptibility in various cultivars of peony.


","Early blight-young shoots can rot as they come through the ground or at the base when only a few inches high. Shoots may appear to suddenly wilt and fall over. A dense, velvety gray fungal growth usually covers the rotting portions. Flowers are attacked at any stage. Buds may turn black before they develop or may be blasted when half open. Flowers infected late turn brown. Blackened buds or flowers may continue to rot down the stem. Stems develop a concentric brown and tan zoned appearance. Leaf spots may develop when infected petals fall on foliage. Later in the year, small, shiny black, slightly loaf-shaped sclerotia form near the base of infected stalks, just under the epidermis.
Late blight-similar, but it usually affects only flowers that open late. The fungus produces a sparse mycelial growth that stands far out from infected tissues. This is in contrast to the dense, tightly compressed growth of early blight. Late blight also produces sclerotia at the base of stalks, but they are much larger and flatter.


","Reducing plant wetness is the most important tactic for limiting disease development.

1) Plant resistant cultivars.

2) Remove and destroy diseased plant parts both during the season (especially spent flowers) and more generally at the end of the season.

3) Space plants for good air circulation.

4) Do not use mulch in spring when plants are emerging.

5) Removing the top few layers of soil around plants may reduce risk by removing sclerotia.

6) Avoid overhead irrigation or any practice that keeps plants wet for extended periods of time.

7) Moving the plant to a more open location that allows for better air circulation may help.

","Use as foliar sprays, but concentrate on cultural controls. Tank-mix and/or alternate products with different modes of action to prevent the buildup of resistant fungi. Limit the use of any one group during crop production.

Peony ,(Paeonia spp.)-Leaf Blotch,"Graphiopsis chlorocephala (formerly Cladosporium paeoniae), a fungus that can impact all aboveground tissues and survives in stem and leaf debris. It has been reported from Washington and found in Oregon. Infection of peony can occur from 50°F to 82°F but the latent period increases as the temperature declines. Free moisture is necessary for conidial germination and infection.


","Infection of young succulent tissues will limit symptoms to flecking while infection of more mature tissues results in large, ex-panding lesions.
Leaves-dark purple glossy spots on upper leaf surfaces, dull chestnut color on undersides. Infection is most pronounced at leaf margins, especially near the tips, and slight distortion may occur as growth continues. Outer leaves usually are attacked first.
Stems-on young stems, elongated reddish brown streaks with slightly diffuse margins. As growth continues, lesions near the plant crown tend to coalesce, darken, and become somewhat depressed. Infection spots are abundant at branch and petiole bases where debris of infected parts may have lodged.

Peony ,(Paeonia spp.)-Stem Rot,"The fungus Sclerotinia sclerotiorum causes stem rot in many plants and occasionally attacks peony. Overwintering sclerotia can survive many years in soil. The disease develops in cool, wet conditions and is more prevalent when plants form a complete, compact canopy that holds high relative humidity. The fungus can colonize dead organic plant matter and survive many years. Plants can be infected when host tissue colonized by the fungus comes in contact with healthy tissues. Plants can also be infected by mycelia growing on the soil surface. In the potato system, flowers are very susceptible to infection and are the main source of stem infection. Infected petals fall onto stems allowing the fungus to gain entry into the stems. Direct penetration, of stems in contact with the soil, from germinating soilborne sclerotia also occurs.


","Shoots suddenly wilt and fall over. The fungus can be seen growing at the plant crown as a fluffy white mycelium. Large black sclerotia form in the stem's pith region and on the surface of infected tissues. Lesions on the foliage and flowers can also occur, which turn brown and also become covered with a fluffy white mycelial growth under moist conditions.

Citrus leaf blotch virus has been found in peony grown in Oregon but was not associated with specific symptoms.
Alfalfa mosaic virus has been found Italy while Cucumber mosaic virus has been reported in France.
The unknown or unspecified problems include peony leaf curl (graft transmissible and found by the OSU Plant Clinic), Le Moine disease, and crown elongation or witches' broom. Few if any works separate the various symptoms and possible viruses involved. Both ringspot and tomato spotted wilt have a wide enough range of symptoms that they could easily be confused.


","Ringspot-Circular areas consisting of concentric bands of alternating dark and light green develop on the leaves. At times, small necrotic spots also form. Yellow mosaic, mottling, banding, or blotching can also occur. Plants are not dwarfed. Cultivar and environmental conditions can influence symptom expression.
Leaf Curl-Plants are half normal height with crooked flower stalks and curled leaves.
Tomato Spotted Wilt-Both line patterns and yellow-green mosaics.
Le Moine-Dwarfed plants with spindly shoots, which fail to bloom. Roots are elongated and irregularly swollen with few feeder roots. Cross sections of the roots show yellow inclusions in the swollen portions.

Pepper ,(Capsicum spp.)-Blossom-end Rot,"A localized calcium deficiency due to any soil or growing condition that affects calcium uptake. This physiological problem is common, especially in home gardens. Blossom-end rot often occurs when soil moisture fluctuates. If too little calcium is in the soil or if the soil is high in salts, calcium uptake will be impeded, especially under periods of sudden drought stress. Excessive nitrogen applications, especially in the ammonium form, can increase a plant's demand for calcium. Once calcium is used in the plant, it becomes immobilized and cannot be translocated from older tissues to younger, growing tissues, which need calcium.


","A water-soaked, light-tan spot at the blossom end or side of a fruit. The spot enlarges, becoming dark brown or black and leathery. Normally, spots are dry but may become soft if secondary bacteria and fungi invade the fruit. Affected fruit ripen faster than normal.


","

1) Do not plant peppers where drainage is poor, surface water accumulates, or soil is droughty.

2) Use a soil test to determine if there is a calcium shortage. If so, add lime, preferably in fall, to adjust soil pH to 6.8 to 7. Mix lime thoroughly in top 8-to-12 inches of soil.

3) Mulch plants with black plastic or loose organic material.

4) Ensure uniform soil moisture. Wet all soil in the root zone at least every 7 to 10 days. About 24 hours after watering, dig a small hole one foot deep to be certain water penetrated that far. Home gardeners should provide even moisture throughout fruiting by controlled watering and mulching.

5) Ensure good air movement by plant spacing and pruning practices. By reducing relative humidity, plant transpiration increases, aiding in the uptake of calcium when sufficient amounts are present in soil.

6) Fertilize only moderately to keep plants normally green and vigorous but not luxuriant. Side-dress with nitrogen fertilizer only if required to maintain green color and moderate growth.

7) Foliar applications of calcium nitrate fertilizers or calcium chloride dihydrate (1.5 teaspoons per gal water plus 0.5 teaspoon of a surfactant such as CapSil) on a weekly basis during fruiting can provide necessary calcium when needed. Phytotoxicity may result but making applications in early morning can help avoid spray injury.

Pepper ,(Capsicum spp.)-Gray Mold,"The fungus, Botrytis cinerea (teleomorph: Botryotinia fuckeliana), is an opportunistic pathogen that easily invades weak, damaged, or senescing tissue. Usually, it is more of a problem on seedlings in greenhouses but can be a problem in the field. All aboveground portions of the pepper plant can be attacked but often disease starts on senescing flowers or fruit damaged by sun scald. Spores (conidia) are produced throughout the growing season under a wide range of temperatures and humidity. Cool temperatures (68°F is optimal but the fungus can grow between 50° and 80°F), high humidity, and free water on plant surfaces favor the disease, as do close plant spacing and irrigation practices that keep plants wet for a longer time. Fields adjacent to water ways may be especially prone to developing both gray and white mold outbreaks in the Willamette Valley. Epidemics have been observed in the Willamette Valley of Oregon, where it was found on bell pepper co-infected with Sclerotinia (the causal agent of white mold).


","The symptoms first appear on petals, injured fruit, or senescing leaves and is initially a dark, water-soaked, slimy lesion and then the affected areas turn brownish-gray and powdery-looking as sporulation develops.

Pepper ,(Capsicum spp.)-Powdery Mildew,"The fungus, Leveillula taurica (syn. = Oidiopsis taurica, Erysiphe taurica), is in only scattered sites in the Pacific Northwest. This disease is restricted to warm, semiarid regions. The fungus has a wide crop and weed host range on which it can overwinter. Temperatures below 86°F favor infection; higher temperatures accelerate symptoms once infection is established. Cool nights permit infection in areas with high daytime temperatures.


","Light green to bright yellow, irregularly shaped blotches develop on upper leaf surfaces; the lesion centers later turn necrotic. Drooping of infected leaves may be observed. The fungus usually is on the leaf's lower side, and can sporulate profusely. Individual leaves die and fall off the plant. Fruit may exhibit sun-scald if plant is defoliated.

Pepper ,(Capsicum spp.)-Virus Diseases,"Several viruses transmitted primarily by aphids, including Alfalfa mosaic virus, Potato virus Y, Pepper mottle virus, Pepper mild mottle virus, Tobacco etch virus, and Cucumber mosaic virus. Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) is spread by aphids but also by mechanical means. Tomato spotted wilt virus infects pepper but is transmitted by thrips. Beet curly top virus (BCTV) is vectored by the beet leafhopper and is common in eastern Washington and Oregon. Many of these viruses overwinter in perennial legumes such as alfalfa and various clovers. Several common weeds are hosts of some of the viruses.


","Mild to distinct yellow to green mottles, ringspots, and line patterns may be on both leaves and fruit. Fruit and plants are stunted and exhibit leaf distortion and/or lateral leaf rolling. Plants infected with BCTV appear stunted, then turn chlorotic and eventually can die. Fruit development stops once infection occurs.


","

1) Plant as far as possible from alfalfa and clover fields and permanent pastures containing clover. Also, in the Hermiston, OR area, locate fields away from borders of irrigated agriculture.

2) Keep area around fields as weed-free as possible.

3) Purchase or plant transplants that are disease- and aphid-free.

4) Reduce mechanical spread of the viruses in the field by limiting entry to essential activities.

5) Do not smoke and then handle plants before washing hands with soap. This is especially important in greenhouse production.

6) Wash hands after handling infected plants.

7) Cultivars with resistance to TMV are: Yolo-wonder, Pennbell, Bell Boy, California Wonder 300, Orobelle, Bell Tower, Elisa, Marguis, Belle Star, Big Belle, Four Corners, Sweet Belle, Bolero, Lamuyo, Emerald Giant, Prima Belle, Lady Bell, La Bamba, Jupiter, and Keystone Resistant Giant.Hot type cultivars resistant to TMV include Anaheim TMR 23, Caloro, Santa Fe Grande, Tam Jalapano, Tam Serrino Hidalgo, and Gold Spike.

","Aphid control helps but will not perfectly control the viruses they transmit. If tomato spotted wilt is a problem, controlling thrips will be of some help. Controlling leafhoppers will not help control beet curly top. For specific control information, consult the PNW Insect Management Handbook.

Pepper ,(Capsicum spp.)-White Mold,"The soilborne fungus, Sclerotinia sclerotiorum, can attack many broad-leaved plants, including pepper, snap bean, carrot, chickpea, cucumber, cabbage, cauliflower, lentil, field pea, potato, squash, and radish. Many broad-leaved weeds are also susceptible, including lambsquarters, Canada thistle, ragweed, and marsh elder. Members of the grass family including small grains, corn and grassy weeds are considered immune.
The pathogen survives as sclerotia in or on the soil. Sclerotia may survive six years or longer. After a moisture-conditioning period, the sclerotia germinate to produce tiny mushroom-like bodies (apothecia), which produce millions of airborne spores. The spores can be produced not only in peppers fields, but also in fields of other crops, including in fields where small grains are rotated after a previously-infected crop. The spores may be windborne to nearby fields where they can infect senescing tissue such as flower blossoms or older leaves. Sometimes sclerotia will germinate and colonize plant debris. After colonizing dead or dying plant tissues, the fungus can then invade healthier parts of plants with which it comes in contact. Moist conditions within the plant canopy favor infection, as do rain, dew, and/or irrigation practices that keep foliage wet for long periods. Fields in low areas or adjacent to rivers can be especially prone to outbreaks.


","The disease is mainly on aboveground parts, producing a soft, watery rot. Diseased tissues eventually bleach white. Sclerotia that are black on the surface and white inside, associated with this bleached tissue, are diagnostic.

Peppermint ,(Mentha spp.)-Spotted Wilt,"The Impatiens necrotic spot virus (INSV) and the Tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV) infect many economically important plants, including both dicots and monocots, and have been found in mint. A number of weedy hosts have been identified and include Lamb's-quarters (Chenopodium album), Chickweed (Stellaria media), Shepherd's purse (Capsella bursa-pastoris), and Purslane (Portulaca oleraceae). TSWV and INSV are transmitted by at least five species of thrips. The onion thrips and the flower thrips are known to be in the Pacific Northwest. The INSV is associated with the most severe symptoms in mint. New mint plantings show the worst symptoms, but they fade or disappear in later years.


","At first, tips and margins yellow on individual leaflets. Symptoms appear first on terminals and move progressively toward the plant base. Yellow leaf areas soon become necrotic, eventually resulting in the leaf's death, followed by death of the entire aboveground portion of the plant. Occasional ringspots are on leaflets. SWV/INSV symptoms in the field are inconsistent, frequently showing only one or even no diagnostic symptoms other than reduced growth. PCR lab testing rather than Elisa testing is highly recommended, because virus titer seems highly erratic in plants.
Early disease stages may be mistaken for powdery mildew. In the field, the underground portion of the plant regrows in the fall. Losses caused by this virus are unknown.

",,
Peppermint ,(Mentha spp.)-Verticillium Wilt,"A fungus, Verticillium dahliae, which lives in soil and in diseased plants. It is soilborne and once established in soil is almost impossible to eradicate due to microsclerotia, which germinate and infect roots. The fungus grows throughout the vascular system and up into mint stems. After diseased plant parts die, microsclerotia form and remain several years in soil. The pathogen is spread with infected rhizomes used for planting and in contaminated surface irrigation water. Co-infection of V. dahliae and the root lesion nematode, Pratylenchus penetrans, increase disease incidence and severity.
The VCG 2B strain of V. dahliae is most aggressive and prevalent in mint. This strain infects potato but symptoms and damage on potato are very mild or do not occur. The VCG 4A and VCG 4B strains, which are frequently obtained from potato, infect mint but symptoms and damage on mint are mild or not evident.
Native spearmint is relatively resistant, but Scotch spearmint and Black Mitcham peppermint are susceptible. Redefined Murray Mitcham is moderately resistant, but this cultivar is not as vigorous as Black Mitcham in the Columbia Basin. Grasses including corn and related crops do not sustain the population, but fallow or grass rotations alone may take many years to effectively reduce soil populations below economic levels.


","First, upper leaves twist and curl. Leaves are bunched at the top of the plant. Infected plants are stunted and foliage is yellowish to red or bronze. Lower leaves die first, then the aboveground part of the plant. With flowering or other stresses, stems or plants may die too rapidly for these symptoms to be observed.


","

1) Use certified -free stock for new plantings.

2) If possible, plant in fields that have not had a history of growing mint. Rotate infested fields with corn and alfalfa.

3) Take severely infested areas of a field out of mint production to prevent spread to new areas or fields. Do not plant mint there for 6 to 10 years unless soil is fumigated before planting.

4) Remove badly infested fields from mint production before wilt becomes so severe that mint will no longer grow.

5) Begin a program of field flaming when wilt first appears in a planting. Fields severely infested with wilt will not respond to flaming.

5.1) Western Oregon-if possible, flame within 1 week after harvest to allow regrowth before frost. This will strengthen the rootstock. If necessary, irrigate after harvest to keep soil moisture adequate for growth. Flame at 1.75 to 2 mph with 40 psi gas pressure.
5.2) Central Oregon and Malheur County, OR-Flame in fall in fields after wilt has appeared, and cultivate only when necessary to control soil insects and soil compaction and for stand regeneration.
6) Plant cultivars Todd's Mitcham, Redefined Murray, Robert's Mitcham or other improved cultivars, which have some resistance to Verticillium wilt and may be cropped successfully on infested soils. In addition to the above cultural controls, observe the following guidelines in using these cultivars.

6.1) Never immediately replant these cultivars in a field where peppermint has failed due to Verticillium wilt.
6.2) On heavily infested soil, rotate out of mint at least 5 years before planting unless soil fumigation precedes planting; otherwise the new planting is likely to fail. Even 5 years may not be sufficient if growing something other than cereals or grass seed.
","Soil fumigation, along with cultural control methods, may help to control wilt. Additional benefits include controlling nematodes that affect mint production. Soil must be properly fumigated for satisfactory results. Factors to consider in soil fumigation include soil preparation, temperature, moisture, and soil surface seal.
Consider the field's history in deciding whether to use fumigants and, if so, at what rate. Wilt potential, or the probability of disease, is related directly to the amount of wilt in the last peppermint crop and the number of years since the last peppermint crop that the field has been in crops other than mint.
Verticillium wilt potential is high in fields where peppermint has failed due to Verticillium wilt and the fields have been rotated to other crops 4 years or less. Wilt potential is low in fields that had a small amount of wilt in peppermint, in fields never in peppermint but that have received Verticillium inoculum from windblown dust, water, etc., and in fields moderately to lightly infested but rotated out of mint 5 years or more to crops other than cereals or grass seed.


1) Telone II at 25 to 30 gal/A as a broadcast treatment in the spring or fall. 5-day reentry.

2) Telone C-17 at 25 gal/A for a low-wilt-potential field, at 27.5 gal/A for a high-wilt-potential field. 5-day reentry.

3) Vapam HL at 37 gal/A for a low-wilt-potential field, at 75 gal/A for a high-wilt-potential field. Also to prevent spread within a field.  Low rate may not adequately control nematodes. 48-hr reentry and/or while tarps are being removed.

Peppermint and Spearmint ,(Mentha spp.)-Rust,"A fungus, Puccinia menthae, which overwinters on mint stubble and on wild and escaped mint. It completes its complex life cycle on one host (autoecious) and is macrocyclic (five spore stages), of which the aecial stage can be systemic in plants. Eleven races have been identified in the Pacific Northwest. Isolates from native spearmint are unable to infect peppermint, and peppermint isolates are unable to infect native spearmint. Isolates from both native spearmint and peppermint infect Scotch spearmint, but the peppermint isolates develop more slowly on Scotch spearmint than those from native spearmint. Peppermint rust is found frequently in western but not in central Oregon, while rust is a major disease on Scotch spearmint in central Oregon. Rust is found on native spearmint and Scotch spearmint in south-central Washington; however, it is not observed on peppermint due to high summer temperatures.


","Brown, circular pustules on the leaves' undersides followed by leaf yellowing and defoliation. A yellow spore stage (urediniospores) is in reddish blisters on young shoots in spring, and a black spore stage (teliospores) is on stems and regrowth in fall. Swollen shoots with elongated, chlorotic internodes are associated with systemic infection.


","

1) Flaming (but do not flame Scotch spearmint) with propane in spring (April 1 to May 15) is absolutely necessary for rust control even if fields were flamed the previous fall. Flamer speed should be 2.5 to 3 mph; gas pressure should be 35 to 40 psi. Speeds less than 3 mph are wasteful; more than 3 mph reduces flamer's effectiveness. Complete flamer coverage is essential. It is not advisable to flame thin stands. Do flame escaped mint in field edges, fence rows, or any other unplowed place. To be most effective, flaming should be community-wide so rust will not spread from untreated to treated fields later in the season.

2) After working fields in spring and when emerging mint shoots are 1 to 3 inches tall, plow under all stubble 3 inches or more. Flame soil surface with propane or other gas flame-type burners to burn back early-emerging young shoots.

3) Early harvest (before leaves drop due to rust) may limit rust damage.

They are highly specialized pathogens that form a close association with the host. Conditions that favor the host also favor the pathogen. Much of the fungus remains outside infected plant parts where it grows on the surface but sinks root-like structures called haustoria into plant cells to obtain nutrients.

Petunia ,(Petunia spp.)-Botrytis Blight,"Botrytis cinerea, a fungus that colonizes senescent, dead, dying, and wounded plant parts. From these infections they can attack healthy tissues. A moist, humid environment is ideal for pathogen sporulation and spread. Conidia may come from sources in and outside the greenhouse. It is found everywhere plants are grown and has a wide host range. Flower petals are most susceptible at any stage of development. The disease can also be a secondary problem to ethylene during transport to markets, called petunia meltdown, especially under warm, wet, low light conditions.


","Senescent flowers develop small translucent or necrotic spots. A leaf blight may occur when infected floral tissue lands on the foliage. Water-soaked lesions may form on the stem and if severe, the shoot will die. Infected stems become tan to light brown and may display the fuzzy olive-brown or gray fungal sporulation.


","

1) Remove all dead and dying plant parts (particularly blossoms) on and around plants. Make sure tight fitting lids are on all garbage cans used to collect plant refuse.

2) Maintain a relatively dry greenhouse environment by keeping humidity below 85%, increasing spacing between plants for good air circulation, and taking care not to splash water on foliage during watering. Heating the greenhouse at night or venting around sunset may be necessary.

3) Place fans in greenhouse to better circulate air.

4) Covering greenhouses with long-wave, infared-absorbing plastic film may help by reducing greenhouse cooling at night. Other coverings that increase the blue:UV ratio can inhibit sporulation of some  isolates but is highly variable between crops and isolates of the fungus.

Petunia ,(Petunia spp.)-Damping-off,"Damping-off refers to a disease that develops on the seed, radicle, hypocotyl, epicotyl, or stem of an emerged seedling. Damping-off is caused by the organisms Pythium spp., Rhizoctonia solani, and Fusarium spp. These organisms also can cause stem lesions and root rot of older plants. None have been reported in the Pacific Northwest, but damping-off caused by one or more of these organisms has been found by the OSU Plant Clinic.
Fusarium survives in the soil as thick-walled, dormant chlamydospores, which germinate in response to exudates from nearby plant roots. Hyphae then penetrate the roots, colonize the cortex, and move into the xylem tissue. Small spores, microconidia, are produced and carried up into the plant.
Rhizoctonia survives in the soil as sclerotia or as mycelium colonizing bits of organic matter. Roots become infected as they grow past these structures. The fungus then grows along root surface, forms an aggregation called an infection cushion, pushes into the root where it colonies, and spreads and kills the tissue. The fungus can form knots of mycelium that develop into sclerotia. These are released into the soil as the plant debris decomposes.
All Pythium species are strongly favored by abundant moisture and can be especially problematic in poorly drained potting media. Pythium usually attacks seeds or seedlings. Pythium spp. can survive in dust, planting media, or soil particles on greenhouse floors, flats, and pots. Wood benches can also be a reservoir. Spread can also occur via movement of infected plants. Damaged plants are more easily infected. It enters roots damaged by high soluble salts, either from overfertilization or from letting the rooting medium dry out, even for short periods, during propagation.


","Poor stand development or seedling collapse are indicative of damping-off. Seeds or emerging radicles may be rotted. After emergence, stem, root, and cotyledon may rot at or below the soil line. It is difficult to determine which organism is involved by causal observation so send into a Plant Clinic for an accurate diagnosis. Plants may be stunted if the pH is below 5.0. Poor germination can also occur with use of old seed.
Pythium spp. causes a soft, mushy rot of ungerminated seeds. Once the radicle is extended or the plant emerges, tissues can be attacked at any point. The infection starts as a brown, water-soaked spot that will enlarge, become soft, and collapse.
Rhizoctonia solani causes reddish brown to dark brown lesions that become slightly sunken. Stem and root lesions often are shallow but may extend deeper in young stem or root tissue. Sometimes brown mycelia may be visible with a hand lens on the surface of the lesions.
Fusarium spp. causes darker red lesions that become brown with reddish borders, or brown lesions with diffuse margins, or similarly discolored longitudinal streaks. Stem and root lesions extend deep into plant tissue.


","

1) Plant seeds at the proper depth in well-drained soil.

2) Seed germination usually is higher if soils are moistened regularly but not saturated. It is important for the soil to dry down without drying out.

3) Plant seeds when temperatures favor rapid germination and growth, so plants rapidly emerge and reach a more mature or hardened state.

4) Use a soilless medium or pasteurized soil to start seedlings. Also disinfect any tools and equipment that might be used and contaminate the media.

5) Keep soilless media pH on the acidic side, ideally from 5.5 to 6.0. Note that petunias tend to naturally increase the growing media pH.

6) Avoid reusing pots or trays from a previous crop for propagation. If pots must be reused then wash off all debris and soak in a sanitizing solution or treat with aerated steam for 30 min.

","Chemical treatment should be preceded by an accurate diagnosis since most of the chemicals are not effective against all pathogens that might cause damping-off.

Petunia ,(Petunia spp.)-Shoot Proliferation and Leafy Gall,,,,,
Petunia ,(Petunia spp.)-Stem Rot,"Sclerotinia sclerotiorum, a fungus that produces hard, black sclerotia, which can survive many years in soil. Sclerotia germinate to form hyphae that may attack plant stems and roots or produce apothecia that contain sexual dispersal spores in the spring. Spores may come in from nearby vegetable fields with the same disease. The disease develops in cool, wet conditions and is more prevalent when plants form a complete, compact canopy that holds high relative humidity. The fungus can colonize dead organic plant matter and survive many years. Wave series cultivars have a prostrate growth habit that is conducive to disease development.
In the potato system, flowers are very susceptible to infection and are the main source of stem infection. Infected petals fall onto stems allowing the fungus to gain entry into the stems. Direct penetration of stems, in contact with the soil, from germinating soilborne sclerotia also occurs.


","Off-color, water-soaked lesions develop near the plant's base. Stems become tan with age, look bleached and may be hollow. Later a white, cottony growth develops on the stem. Because of this growth the disease is often called white mold. Hard, black sclerotia may develop with the white growth or in hollow tan stems. Lower leaves tend to die first. Leaf tissue may appear to 'melt out.' The plant's upper portion wilts and eventually dies. A flower blight may also occur.


","

1) Use a soilless medium or pasteurized soil to start seedlings. Keep soilless media pH on the acidic side, ideally from 5.5 to 6.0. Note that petunias tend to naturally increase the growing media pH.

2) Space plants for good air circulation.

3) Avoid overhead irrigation or any practice that keeps plants wet for extended periods of time.

4) Remove and destroy infected plants as soon as they are found.

5) Clean up and remove crop remains promptly at the end of the growing season.

6) Rotate with less susceptible crops such as alyssum, daffodil, salvia, pansy, or ornamental grasses. Resistant crops include rushes, sedges, and the fountain grass .

7) Avoid reusing pots or trays from a previous crop for propagation. If pots must be reused then wash off all debris and soak in a sanitizing solution or treat with aerated steam for 30 min.

Petunia ,(Petunia spp.)-Viruses,"Several viruses have been a problem on petunia including Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV), Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV), Beet curly top virus, and Impatiens necrotic spot virus. Other viruses reported on petunia include Potato virus Y, Tomato mosaic virus, Alfalfa mosaic virus, Tomato ringspot virus (ToRSV), Tobacco streak virus, Petunia vein clearing virus, and Broad bean wilt virus 1. A newer virus causing leaf mottling in 2012 was provisionally named Petunia chlorotic mottle virus (PCMoV).
CMV is spread by aphids,  TMV by infected plant to healthy plant contact, workers with contaminated hands who handle the plants and with contaminated tools during propagation. TMV is very stable and may survive on greenhouse benches, tools and other surfaces for months. Curly top is widespread, fairly common, and vectored by the beet leafhopper. Infected plants are damaged aesthetically.


","Plants infected with TMV have mottled green and yellowish green deformed leaves. Necrotic tip dieback, strapped shaped or rat-tailing of leaves and yellowing along the leaf veins is also possible. Blossoms usually are deformed and mottled and could also have a color break. Plants are stunted. Many infected plants may show no symptoms at all.
Plants with beet curly top usually are stunted and have mottled, deformed leaves.

1) Incoming plants from other operations should be carefully screened for diseases symptoms.

2) Remove and destroy diseased plants. Workers should wear disposable gloves.

3) Plant handlers, especially those who use tobacco, should wash hands thoroughly with soap before handling petunias.

Phlox,Black Root Rot,,,,,
Phlox,Downy Mildew,"Downy mildew on phlox is caused by the fungus-like organism Peronospora phlogina. Although not formally reported from the Pacific Northwest, it has been found by both the OSU and WSU Plant Clinics. This fungus is known to infect only plants in the phlox family Polemoniaceae, such as the genera Collomia sp., Gilia sp., Microsteris sp., Navarretia sp., and Phlox sp. Some of these plants are native to the Western United States and may be hosts for the disease. Cool, wet conditions favor infection and sporangia development. Sporangia are windborne spores that are easily disseminated throughout an area such as a greenhouse.


","Irregular yellow areas on the leaf and slow-growing, slightly distorted stems are the most common symptoms. White-to-grayish fungal growth on either the lower or upper surfaces of leaves and on newer portions of stem indicate downy mildew. It sometimes is confused with powdery mildew.


","It is easier to control if spotted before it is widespread.

1) Scout plants carefully for symptoms of the disease especially the undersides of leaves and any stock plants or plants held over from the previous year.

2) Immediately remove and discard infected plants.

3) Heat and vent greenhouses late in the day to lower relative humidity at night.

4) Maintain adequate fertility.

","Protective applications are important, particularly when the disease has been a problem in previous years. Once the disease is detected, apply two (2) to three (3) times at the closest intervals allowed. Close intervals may be necessary when environmental parameters cannot be manipulated to avoid conditions that favor disease.

Phlox,"Nematode, Stem","The nematode Ditylenchus dipsaci enters through natural openings, such as stomata, of young shoots and through wounds. It lives and feeds inside the stem, moves up as the shoot grows, and can exist under the seed coat. It can infect many hosts. Movement and reproduction rates are high between 69°F and 77°F. The nematode can be spread via contaminated soil or media, water, garden tools, shoes, and infested seed. Detached or dried leaves can also serve as a source of the nematode. The larval stage can survive several years in a dry state (anabiosis). The problem has been diagnosed a few times by the OSU Plant Clinic. Phlox cultivars are not equally susceptible, and some cultivars seem to be immune.


","Abnormal growth is common. Leaves may be curled and/or wrinkled but of normal width, or they may be spindly to thread-like. Stems may be swollen near the tops while basal buds exhibit a stimulated growth. Plants can be stunted, fail to bloom, and die prematurely.


","

1) Use clean plant material for propagation.

2) Immediately remove and destroy infested plants.

3) In the landscape, replace or sterilize soil before planting susceptible hosts back in the same site.

","No chemicals are labeled to treat greenhouse plants infected with this nematode.

Phlox,Powdery Mildew,"The fungi Golovinomyces cichoracearum (formerly Erysiphe cichoracearum) and Podosphaera macularis have been reported from Oregon (found by the OSU Plant Clinic) and Washington. These fungi are favored by conditions that produce high humidity but dry leaves. They are highly specialized pathogens that form a close association with the host. Conditions that favor the host also favor the pathogen. Much of the fungus remains outside infected plant parts where it grows on the surface but sinks root-like structures called haustoria into plant cells to obtain nutrients. The white growth seen is composed of both mycelium and fungal spores.

Photinia,Root Rot,"A fungus-like organism, Phytophthora sp., has been found in rotted roots by the OSU Plant Clinic. Poorly drained soil or flooding encourages disease development. The organism survives unfavorable periods in soil and infected plant debris. Under favorable conditions, spores germinate and infect roots. After infection, the microorganism spreads mainly in the inner bark tissues of the root. They survive as various spores in the soil, container media, or infected roots. Movement of infected plants and/or soil can spread the microorganism.


","Aboveground symptoms include interveinal chlorosis, slowed shoot growth, limb dieback, wilting and death. Fine feeder roots are brittle and brown to reddish brown if they can be found at all. Browning of feeder roots often begins near the base of the root ball, easily seen in containers when the root ball is removed. Eventually the entire root system is destroyed.


","

1) Container production should be on raised benches or gravel covered beds sloped to quickly drain excess water.

2) Avoid reusing pots from a previous crop for propagation. If pots must be reused then wash off all debris and soak in a sanitizing solution or treat with aerated steam for 30 min.

3) Avoid ponding of water around plants.

4) Avoid over- or underwatering plants.

5) Plant in a well-drained area or container media.

","Fungicide programs usually are effective only if combined in a management program with strict sanitation and good nursery management. Use fungicides as preventative treatments. The Group 4 and 33 fungicides used to manage Phytophthora do not kill this organism. They can only prevent establishment of the organism before it gets into the plant. They can also prevent continued growth if the organism is already inside the plant thereby delaying symptoms that might have developed. Once chemical activity has subsided with time, the organism can resume growth within infected plants.

","
Atropellis canker - cankers occur on the limbs of young trees, but seldom on the main trunk. The needles on branches girdled by the cankers die and are easily seen from a distance. The cankers are smooth, elongated, and flattened depressions, which remain covered by the bark. The wood under the canker is bluish black. The black fruiting bodies (apothecia) on the bark are very small, rarely measuring more than 0.125 inch in diameter, and usually have a short central stalk. Most cankers are found on trees up to 40 ft high. Lodgepole pine may have copious resin flow from the cankers. Young seedlings are frequently killed by girdling cankers. Possible to confuse with rust diseases.
Dasyscyphus canker -  The perennial cankers are swollen and flat faced and the bark over the canker is roughened and cracked. Excessive resin flow is often associated with the cankers. They are usually found on the smaller branches which they eventually girdle. On larger branches the cankers persist, but do not girdle the branch. The cup-shaped fruiting bodies (apothecia) present on the face of the cankers measure up to 0.25 inch in diameter and have a short stalk. The inner surface of the cup is bright orange, while the outside is brown and hairy.

Pine ,(Pinus spp.)-Cyclaneusma Needle Cast,"A fungus, Cyclaneusma minus (formerly Naemacyclus minor). Hosts include Scots, Austrian, Virginia, lodgepole, mugo, and ponderosa pine. Spores are produced on both attached and fallen needles. Rain and wind disseminate spores any time of year when temperatures are above freezing. Spores infect needles through stomata any time from April through November.


","Infected needles develop no symptoms until the end of their second growing season. Then, needles turn yellow with brown bars. White to tan fruiting bodies (apothecia) develop in the bars, but needles remain attached for several months. Severely infected trees may hold only 1 year's complement of needles.
Can easily be confused with other needle cast diseases. Needle cast diseases are identified by microscopically examining fruiting bodies and spores. Needle casts can also be confused with annual (normal) fall needle drop. Most conifers shed some of their oldest needles in the fall. These old needles often turn yellow or brown before falling off.

Pine ,(Pinus spp.)-Dothistroma Needle Blight (Red Band),"Dothistroma septosporum (sexual: Mycosphaerella pini), a fungus reported in Oregon, Idaho and British Columbia. Dothistroma pini is found mostly in the North Central United States but has been reported from Idaho. The red band disease has caused serious losses in some Christmas tree plantings of hard pine (two- and three-needle pines), Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris), Austrian pine (P. nigra), and shore or lodgepole pine (P. contorta), as well as in plantations of lodgepole pine in BC. Five-needle pines also are reported to be susceptible. The fungus attacks both current-season needles and needles produced in past seasons. Black, asexual fungal structures (stroma) mature 1 to 2 years after initial infection. Spores produced within the stroma are spread, mostly by rain and only up to 6.5 ft, to cause new infections. Usually by mid-August all spores have been disseminated. Spores germinate under moist conditions and penetrate stomata. A toxin, dothistromin, diffuses into the tissue ahead of the fungus, killing plant cells. The fungus can persist in cast needles longer if the needles are suspected or caught up in the canopy when compared to infected needles that fall onto the forest floor.


","Chlorotic spots on infected needles in fall and winter. Spots gradually spread, turn red-brown, and girdle the needles, killing the distal end while the base stays green. In early spring, a black fungal growth (stromata) erupts through the needle epidermis. Affected trees may defoliate during the growing season, rendering the trees useless for sale. Reduced growth rate is another result of annual defoliation.
Can easily be confused with other needle cast diseases. Needle cast diseases are identified by microscopically examining fruiting bodies and spores. Needle casts can also be confused with annual (normal) fall needle drop. Most conifers shed some of their oldest needles in the fall. These old needles often turn yellow or brown before falling off.

Pine ,(Pinus spp.)-Dwarf Mistletoe,"Many pine species in Oregon are affected by various species of dwarf mistletoes (Arceuthobium spp.), which are parasitic flowering plants. Highly host-specific, each dwarf mistletoe species typically has one or two primary host species and only occasionally infects other hosts. Western dwarf mistletoe (A. campylopodum) is a widespread disease of ponderosa pine, infects Jeffrey pine where it occurs in southwestern Oregon, and occasionally infects lodgepole pine. Lodgepole pine dwarf mistletoe (A. americanum) is very common throughout the range of lodgepole pine, and also occasionally infects ponderosa, whitebark, and Jeffrey pines. A. americanum does not infect shore pine, however shore pine dwarf mistletoe (A. tsugense subsp. contortae) is found in British Columbia and the San Juan Islands of Washington State. Knobcone pine dwarf mistletoe (A. siskiyouense) is known to occur on an inland population of shore pine north of Cave Junction, Oregon as well as on knobcone pine in the Klamath and Siskiyou Mountains. Limber pine dwarf mistletoe (A. cyanocarpum) is found on whitebark pine in the Cascade Range and near Crater Lake; it is also occasionally found on western white pine. Western white pine dwarf mistletoe (A. monticola) occurs on western white pine in southwestern Oregon and is locally endemic there.
Dwarf mistletoe seeds spread by explosive discharge and have the ability to disperse up to 50 feet, although they are more commonly intercepted by host needles within 10 feet. After adhering to tree needles, the seed is washed down to the twig where germination and infection occur. Branch swellings at the site of infection often form within 1 to 2 years. Dwarf mistletoe requires an incubation time of 3 to 5 years prior to the emergence of aerial shoots, although incubation times of up to 8 years have been observed. Pollination of female plants, fruit production and dispersal often occur 2 to 3 years after the emergence of aerial shoots.
Severe infection by dwarf mistletoe causes large losses of timber by slowing both height and diameter growth, degrading wood quality, and increasing the risk of mortality. Severe infection may also lead to increased host susceptibility to crown fire and insect attack, as well as decreased cone and seed production. Advance regeneration is often infected in these stands so clear-cutting alone is insufficient. Due to long life-cycle and dispersal mechanism, recolonization of dwarf mistletoe in sanitized stands happens very slowly.
Dwarf mistletoe shoots and brooms provide habitat and resources for many species of birds, mammals, insects, and arachnids, and have been shown to increase biodiversity in certain forest types.


","Yellow to light green plants occur at the site of infection, ranging in height from 1 to 4 inches depending on species. Plants form most often on pine branches, but may also be found on the trunk of the host. Branch swellings at points of infection are common. Witches' brooms, abnormally shaped, compact, dense, branches are common in infected trees. Top-kill and loss of uninfected branches in the crown is often associated with the presence of witches' brooms.


","

1) Prune infected branches of lightly infected trees. Pruning is ineffective in severely infected trees.

2) Remove severely infected trees where uninfected, susceptible trees are nearby.

Pine ,(Pinus spp.)-Elytroderma Needle Cast,"The fungus Elytroderma deformans is a serious needle cast of ponderosa and Jeffrey pine. Hosts also include Coulter, knobcone, lodgepole, and pinyon pine. Spores disperse in spring or early summer, infecting current-season needles. After infecting, the fungus can become systemic, growing through the needle into twigs where it can survive unfavorable conditions. It is most damaging along creeks and lakeshores or in drainages with moist environmental conditions.


","Needles stay green 1 year after infection, turning red the next spring. Witches' brooms form several years later. Infected twigs have brown necrotic flecks in the inner bark. Needles on these twigs are infected during formation. The narrow, elongate, black fruiting bodies (hysterothecia) form on all surfaces of dead needles and are visible on 2-year-old infected, red needles.
Can easily be confused with other needle cast diseases. Needle cast diseases are identified by microscopically examining fruiting bodies and spores. Needle casts can also be confused with annual (normal) fall needle drop. Most conifers shed some of their oldest needles in the fall.

Pine ,(Pinus spp.)-Lophodermium Needle Cast,"Lophodermium spp. Nineteen species, mostly host-specific, are in the Pacific Northwest. L. seditiosum is the main problem and occurs on Scots (Scotch) pine, infecting current-season needles, which may be killed by the next season. Wet weather and poor air circulation, which keep foliage wet, favor disease development. These fungi are variable enough that some viable fruit bodies are available for a low level of spore production all year long. L. pinastri and other species cause casting of 2- and 3-year-old Scots pine needles. L. baculiferum on ponderosa pine and L. nitens on white pine are commonly found in the forest and sometimes on ornamentals.
The black hysterithecia are conspicuous on fallen pine needles but are usually not an indication of an important disease problem. Less pathogenic Lophodermium species usually cause minimal injury to needles.


","On Scots pine, L. seditiosum forms yellow spots on infected needles. These may coalesce and become reddis-brown by April. Soon the entire needle becomes reddish brown and usually is cast, lodging in remaining foliage or on the ground. The blackish, football-shape fruiting bodies (hysterothecia, a type of apothecium) mature in late summer and disperse spores that invade the most recent foliage when autumn rains begin. The disease may stunt or kill seedlings or transplants.
L. baculiferum and L. nitens yellow foliage in mid- or late summer. Yellowed needles subsequently drop. The fungus fruits in dead foliage after casting or while still on the tree. The hysterothecia are football shape and black. When mature, they split down the middle to expose the spore layer. In favorably wet conditions, these fungi may cause widespread and noticeable symptoms on forest trees. They also are reported to damage forest nursery seedlings.

Generally, basidiospores infect pines in late summer to early fall. Aeciaspores are produced in the spring and infect the alternate host. Urediniospores are produced on the alternate host and may have many cycles during the summer before telia are produced in the fall. Young trees seem to suffer the worst from loss of growth and proximity to alternate hosts, but generally the disease is not a severe problem.


","Coleosporium asterum-needles may develop reddish-orange dots on yellow spots or bands. A month later, flat-sided, white columns break open at the sides (aecia). Needles may remain on the tree for 1 or 2 years, producing new crops of spores. Young trees may have heavy needle loss on lower branches. Bright orange pustules (uredinia) develop on the aster host.

Pine ,(Pinus spp.)-Pine Wilt,"This disease involves complicated interactions between a pathogenic nematode (Bursaphelenchus xylophilus, the pine wood nematode), its vector beetle, host pine species, and fungi in the dead tree. Pathogenicity of the pine wood nematode is determined not only by its physical and chemical traits but also by its behavioral traits. The pine wood nematode is known to infest many species of Pinus, with Austrian Pine (P. nigra), Scotch Pine (P. sylvestris), and Japanese Black Pine (P. thunbergii) the most susceptible in the Eastern United States. Ponderosa pine (P. ponderosa), lodgepole pine (P. contorta var. murrauyana), and white pine (P. albicaulis) are not as susceptible.
The nematode was found in central Oregon on 8 of 105 samples of green ponderosa pine lumber but was not found in statewide Douglas-fir, redwood or white fir samples. Because of its potential, several European countries (Finland, Norway, and Sweden) and Korea have established embargoes against the importation of coniferous wood from regions of the world known to be infested with the pine wood nematode. Although the pine wood nematode is not considered an economic pest in North American forests, the recent embargoes have established an impact on current forest management practices and an economic impact on North American export trade.
The mechanism causing quick death of large pine trees, due to the tiny nematodes, is thought to be a dysfunction of the water conducting system caused by the death of parenchyma cells.


","Sudden death of trees occurs during heat stress where trees exhibit needle chlorosis, wilting and browning.


","Exported lumber is kiln-dried which kills both nematode and bettle vectors.

Pine ,(Pinus spp.)-Root Rot (Armillaria ostoyae),,,,,
Pine ,(Pinus spp.)-Root Rot (Phytophthora spp.),"The fungus-like organisms Phytophthora cinnamomi and P. citricola have been found by the OSU Plant Clinic. P. cactorum has been isolated from western white pine seed trees in northern Idaho. Root rot is a problem when trees are planted in containers or planted in areas with poor drainage or where flooding occurs. It is mainly a problem in nurseries that use overhead irrigation during the growing season. Can also be a problem were trees are planted for seed production. The pathogens can infect roots under water-logged soil conditions.
Watering shore pines in lawn settings is hard on trees as they are adapted to the dry summer/fall conditions of the PNW. Watering can increase root rot diseases caused by Phytophthora sp. and Armillaria sp. Mugo pines (P. mugo) grown in ornamental container nurseries are often susceptible to this disease. Seedlings of lodgepole pine (P. contorta) and poderosa pine (P. ponderosa) are considered highly tolerant while sugar pine (P. lambertiana) and western white pine (P. monticola) and considered tolerant when challenge inoculated with 5 species that did not include P. cinnamomi.


","These organisms attack the roots, which rot and die. The infection moves up into the root crown, where the cambium (soft inner bark) turns reddish brown instead of the normal greenish white. Older trees may develop cankers on the trunk, possibly accompanied by split bark and oozing pitch. Lower branches wilt, turn brown, and die back. Younger trees often die outright when infected. Mature trees, once infected, may show wilting, branch dieback, or other signs of inhibited water and nutrient uptake.


","

1) Avoid soil compaction, which reduces drainage. Construction, heavy foot traffic, or machinery can cause soil compaction.

2) Improve soil drainage by incorporating organic material or using raised beds.

3) Place containers on gravel beds (4 inches or more deep) to allow drainage. Do not place containers on poly sheets; they can prevent containers from draining into soil and allow contaminated drainage water to spread from the base of one container to another.

4) Avoid reusing pots from a previous crop for propagation. If pots must be reused then wash off all debris and soak in a sanitizing solution or treat with aerated steam for 30 min.

5) Prevent disease by planting only pathogen-free materials in uninfected soil.

Pine ,(Pinus spp.)-Salt Damage,"Salt damage to shore pine is a common phenomenon along the coast in certain years. Violent storms and high winds along the coast pick up salt spray (usually in winter) and can blow this inland a considerable distance. Salt interferes with normal biological function of the needle and will kill part or all of a shore pine needle. There is a clear landscape effect, with trees in exposed windward hillsides overlooking the ocean often getting the full brunt of the salt and the more inland hilltops occasionally showing symptoms as well.


","Needles redden and die, or will have portions of the needle die depending on how much salt is deposited. This can give the tree crowns a singed or scorched look, which may only occur on the windward side of the crown.

Pine ,(Pinus spp.)-Tip Blight,"Diplodia sapinea (formerly Sphaeropsis sapinea), a fungus. Has become more of a problem in Idaho and Oregon on ponderosa pine. Also is a problem on Austrian, Scots, red, and mugo pine. The disease normally does not kill trees but allows other organisms (such as pine beetles) to gain entry, which may kill the tree. Generally a problem on older trees. Trees that are stressed because of poor site, drought, snow damage, or insect activity are very susceptible. For example, trees found in the transition area between high desert and foothills in central Oregon. Tree wounds are an entry for the fungus. Spores produced on infected plant debris spread to new shoots during wet spring weather. Infections may remain latent (symptomless) for many years. Under low water conditions, latent infections of red pine seedlings activate with rapid symptom development.


","Stunted, discolored needles develop on new spring growth. The shoot tip continues to die back to the main stem, killing older needles as the season progresses.

Pine ,(Pinus spp.)-Twig Blight,"Cenangium ferruginosum, a fungus reported to be common in Washington on Lodgepole pine. The disease is generally restricted to trees that have low vigor as a result of site or climatic conditions. The disease may appear serious and widespread the first year after a severe winter and then subside during the next growing season.


","The needles on infected twigs become reddish and drop off. Generally limited to the current season's growth, but may occasionally spread into the two-year wood or into older portions of the branch. The dead twigs, devoid of needles, are very conspicuous at the end of the growing season. At this time, the cup-shaped fruiting structures (apothecia) can be found on the dead twigs. They are black to deep brown on the outside and greenish yellow within. In dry weather these fruiting structures are closed and globose, but during wet weather they open and become cup shaped.


","

1) Prune out infected branches.

2) Landscape trees-keep trees well-watered and stress free. Also, do not overfertilize.

","Unknown if any will work but suspect chemicals applied for other early spring diseases may be effective.

Pine ,(Pinus spp.)-Western Gall Rust,"Endocronartium harknessii (formerly Peridermium harknessii), a fungus. The disease is commonly found on the hard pines, particularly those with two needles in the fascicle. Shore pine (Pinus contorta), lodgepole pine (P. contorta var. latifolia), mugo pine (P. mugo), Scots pine (P. sylvestris), and Austrian pine (P. nigra), appear particularly susceptible. Ponderosa pine (P. ponderosa) does not appear particularly susceptible. This is one of the most common diseases of shore pine yet can be very patchy in distribution.
Unlike white pine blister rust, western gall rust does not require an alternate host to complete its life cycle. Spores produced on pine can reinfect susceptible pines. Spores are shed primarily during shoot elongation. Shoots are susceptible from budbreak through shoot elongation. In the natural landscape, the disease is most commonly found in riparian areas or locations where moist air collects.


","Rough, globular galls on trunk or branches. Galls are proportionate in size to the branches bearing them. When the fungus is fruiting (aecia), galls are orange or yellow. Galls may kill small trees but increase in size for many years on larger trees. Trees may break easily at the gall.


","

1) Remove trees with galls within 300 yards of nurseries.

2) In nurseries, remove all affected trees.

3) Forest-cull heavily infected trees.

4) Remove galls whenever practical.

5) Favor uninfected or lightly infected trees during thinning or seed collection.

","Needed only for landscape trees or Christmas trees. Protect new shoots from budbreak through shoot elongation.


1) Preventive fungicide applications. Based on a single trial in California with Monterey pine, triadimefon (Group 3 fungicide) provided 7 days of protection and about 2 weeks of kickback activity. Disease control averaged 70%.

"Pine, White",White Pine Blister Rust,"Cronartium ribicola, a fungus. The fungus attacks all five-needle pines including whitebark pine (Pinus albicaulis), which is the most susceptible, sugar pine (P. lambertiana), western white pine (P. monticola), eastern white pine (P. strobus), limber pine (P. flexilis), bristlecone pine (P. aristata) and floxtail pine (P. balfouriana), which is the least susceptible. In addition to many Ribes species that serve as alternate hosts, Castilleja (Indian paintbrush) and Pedicularis are also telial hosts.
The fungus overwinters in tree cankers. In spring, spores form in orange pustules (aecia) on cankers. Wind distributes aeciospores to currants and gooseberries, the principal alternate hosts. Uredinia form on the underside of these Ribes hosts and produce urediniospores. The urediniospores can only reinfect more Ribes hosts and continue to do so during the rest of the growing season. Telia form in late summer where the uredinia are located. The teliospores are not dispersed but germinate to form another spore type called a basidiospore. These spores are blown to white pine, causing new infections by penetrating through stomata of needles (unless stomata are occluded by epicuticular wax). Pycnia appear on the bark the following spring. Aecia erupt from the same area where the pycnia formed the previous year. Aeciospores are produced perennially until the branch dies.
The disease is favored by cool, moist habitats rather than warm, dry areas. Open stands with a thick shrub layer encourages a moist air flow and thus distribution of spores. As one moves east away from the Cascade Crest, there is less rust along the east slope of the Cascades and into central and south-central OR. For example, there are low levels of rust on Walker Ridge on the Crescent District of the Deschutes National Forest (where sugar pine, western white pine, and some whitebark pine are present) and on the Fremont-Winema, low rust levels east of Klamath Falls. West of the Upper Klamath Lake closer to the crest there is moderate-to-high rust levels.
Similar rusts occur on other pines including Comandra blister rust (Cronartium comandrae) on ponderosa and lodgepole pines and Stalactiform rust (Cronartium coleosporoides) on lodgepole pine. Comandra blister rust alternates on bastard toadflax (Comandra sp.) while stalactiform rust alternates on chickweeds such as Cerastium sp. and Stellaria sp.


","The first symptom is a yellow or red spot on infected needles in the spring. By fall, orange hyphae may be seen in the bark at the base of these needles. Dark lesions develop in this area and continue to develop into the characteristic diamond-shape cankers. Old cankers are rough and elongate structures that develop on trunks and branches, causing dieback or ""flagging."" Orange spore masses burst through the margins of the cankered bark (aecia). An abundant pitch flow usually accompanies canker formation. A branch or branch stub may be near the canker's center. Generally observed in the lower portion of trees.


","

1) Rate planting sites for blister-rust hazard, and plant resistant stock in medium- to high-hazard sites.

2) Preventive pruning of lower branches is effective at minimizing risk and removing early infections.

3) When cutting severely infected stands, retain uninfected trees for seed sources.

4) Prune infected branches with cankers more than 4 inches from the trunk.

5) In landscaping, do not plant white pine near cultivated or native currants or gooseberries.

","Protect needles in the fall when telia are produced on the alternate host.

"Plum, Flowering",Brown Rot Blossom Blight,"The fungi Monilinia fructicola and M. laxa can incite both a blossom blight, a twig and branch dieback. Fungi survive year to year on infected twigs, branches, old flower parts, or mummified fruit of other Prunus spp. Conidia are produced on infected plant debris in the tree when the temperature is above 40°F. Wind and rain blow spores (conidia and ascospores) to healthy blossoms in spring to begin the infection process during wet weather. Infection does not occur below 50°F and will occur for M. laxa above 55°F. Flowers can be blighted any time floral tissue is exposed but are most susceptible at full bloom. More spores can be produced on this tissue, initiating several more disease cycles during the spring. Under severe conditions, non-flowering shoots or leaves can be infected directly.
Both fruiting and ornamental plums (purple leaf plums), peaches, nectarines, prunes, cherries, almonds, and apricots are susceptible. Susceptible cultivars include Prunus x cistena, P. x blireiannna while resistant cultivars include P. cerasifera 'Frankthrees' (Mt. St. Helens), Krauter Vesuvius, Newport, and Thundercloud. During the cool wet spring of 2010 cultivars Krauter Vesuvius and Thundercloud were badly affected in western Oregon.


","Infected flower parts turn light brown and may develop areas of buff-color (M. fructicola) or gray (M. laxa) spores. Infected petals may look water soaked, which can be mistaken for frost injury. Flowers generally collapse as the fungus invades through the pedicel. Infected flowers often adhere to twigs and spurs through harvest or even winter. Depending on the fungus and plant infected, the disease may continue into twigs or spurs. Lesions may remain discrete or girdle the twig, causing all distal portions to die. Profuse gumming also may occur in these areas. Again, buff or gray spores (in sporodochia) may develop on these necrotic twigs.


","These must be supplemented by chemical control methods especially in the wettest areas such as west of the Cascade Range.

1) Remove and destroy infected twigs and branches in summer.

2) Use moderate amounts of nitrogen fertilizer.

3) Plant resistant cultivars.

","Do not use on edible fruit or within 12 months of harvest. Only one (1) or two (2) applications during bloom are needed most years. Tank-mix and/or alternate products with different modes of action to prevent the build-up of resistant fungi. Limit the use of any one group during crop production.

This disease has been reported to spread rapidly especially with overhead irrigation. Considered a rare disease and typically associated with outdoor poinsettia cultivation. This disease has occurred sporadically in greenhouse production. Sources of bacteria may include geranium, croton (Codiaeum variegatum), crown of thorns (E. milli), and zebra plant (Aphelandra squarrosa).


","Dull, grayish-brown, slightly water-soaked spots first on undersides of leaves. As spots enlarge, they can be seen on the top side of the leaf. Spots may be angular and develop a yellow halo. Spots are limited to the areas of tissue adjacent to and between minor leaf veins, which give them the angular shape. Spots generally are of different sizes and uneven in distribution across the leaf. Spots may coalesce, forming large areas of dead tissue that become dry, papery and easily torn. Heavily infected leaves drop prematurely. Does not cause cankers on stems.

It also can survive in plant debris. Wounds are a common entry way for the bacteria. Any factor that stresses cuttings favors the disease. Cool temperatures may delay symptoms until warm weather occurs.


","Cuttings develop a soft, mushy rot beginning at the basal end. Symptoms can develop in 24 to 48 hours when conditions are optimal for disease development. If infected plants survive the cutting phase, stunting and vascular browning may occur later. Stems and leaves also may wilt, darken, and look water-soaked, followed by complete plant collapse.


","The focus is on keeping aboveground plant parts dry.

1) Destroy plant debris in and around the greenhouse.

2) Avoid waterlogging the rooting medium. Water at the base of plants. Use a medium that holds less water overall.

3) When propagating keep misting minimal, especially at night, and stop as soon as possible once cuttings begin to root.

4) Keep temperatures below 90°F.

5) Wash hands before pinching, and keep cutting tools disinfected.

6) Give stock plants moderate nitrogen fertility. Avoid calcium deficiency.

7) Disinfect cutting knives, containers, and benches frequently when harvesting cuttings. Use two knives so a worker can cut with one while the other soaks. When done with a batch, cultivar, etc. switch one knife for the other and allow the used one to soak.

Poinsettia ,(Euphorbia pulcherrima)-Basal Stem and Root Rot,"Thielaviopsis basicola, a soilborne fungus that can survive long periods without a host plant. Cool soils (55°F to 70°F), high pH (at or above 5.5), and high soil moisture content (more than 70%) favor the disease. Plants are susceptible at all growth stages. Infection can occur anywhere on the root system.


","Black root rot causes lower leaves to yellow, wilt, and roll. Longitudinal black cracks may appear in stems. Infected plants are stunted and may defoliate and die. Root discoloration is brown initially, then a dark, flat, black as abundant chlamydospores form on and in the root. Infected roots are generally left intact by comparison with Pythium root rot.


","Focus on cultural control tactics as fungicides do not compensate for poor sanitation or environmental controls. Note that a pH low enough to suppress black root rot (5.2) is lower than the recommended pH range of 5.8 to 6.2.

1) Plant pathogen-free cuttings.

2) Use soilless, well-drained potting mix or steam-treated soil and rooting media. Steam 30 min. at 180°F.

3) Use new or sterile pots. Avoid reusing pots but if reusing, thoroughly remove organic matter and old media, then wash with a disinfectant such as a 10% bleach solution.

4) Grow plants at night temperatures of 70°F to 76°F.

5) Carefully remove diseased plants during the growing cycle so that adjacent plants are not contaminated, and remove diseased plants from the plant production or adjacent areas.

6) Control fungus gnats and shore flies, which spread viable spores on their bodies and in their feces. Consult the  for current control tactics.

Poinsettia ,(Euphorbia pulcherrima)-Fluoride Toxicity,,,,,
Poinsettia ,(Euphorbia pulcherrima)-Gray Mold,"cinerea, a fungus. The disease is especially severe on double cultivars and in cold, moist greenhouses. It can occur on all stages of development and on all plant parts. Conidia are easily dispersed by air currents. The fungus depends on a water film for conidial germination and infection. Nutrients on the surface of plants encourage infection. The fungus secretes cell-wall degrading enzymes ahead of the advancing infection. Older mature leaves are more susceptible to infection. Bracts or leaves damaged by several things, including bract burn (calcium deficiency), are easily colonized by this fungus. Wounded cuttings are also common sites of infection. Infected tissues that drop onto healthy plant parts are another way the fungus can spread. Latent infections are a common problem with disease development after plants are packed and shipped.


","Tan to brown lesions form on leaves, stems, and bracts. Long tan cankers can form on stems and induce wilting. Infected bracts of red poinsettias may turn purple. Lesions are often noticed first on the edges of young leaves and bracts, turning darker as they expand. Lesions grow into large necrotic wedges and may look zonate with repeated expansion. Latex may exude from the undersides of lesions. Affected parts become covered with a mass of gray spores.


","The focus is on keeping leaves and bracts dry. Maintaining temperatures above the dew point is very effective. Mature plants are very susceptible and management strategies should be intensified during crop finishing and postharvest handling. Wounds on both stock plants and cuttings during propagation are another critical stage for management.

1) Space plants to allow good air circulation and get light to lower leaves. Wire mesh benches can help facilitate air movement.

2) Grow with adequate nitrogen and light levels to prevent leaf senescence. Calcium is also an essential nutrient.

3) Maintain night temperature above 60°F.

4) Provide good air movement at night.

5) Heat and vent to expel moist air to reduce humidity.

Poinsettia ,(Euphorbia pulcherrima)-Powdery Mildew,"The fungus Pseudoidium poinsettiae was found in Oregon first in 1990. It has not been a big problem but left unchecked can spread very quickly. Many cultivars are susceptible. Spores are liberated from colonies under conditions of changing relative humidity. Spores can germinate within 6 hours at 68°F and establish an infection within 24 hours. However, temperatures above 85°F inhibit the process.


","Symptoms vary widely. They can be subtle on the leaf surface and are best seen on the leaf underside. Upper leaf surfaces may show only slight chlorosis in diffuse spots. Turning the leaf over can reveal a sparse to heavy mycelial growth that can be white to gray. Individual colonies will grow together until they merge and cover the surface of leaves or bracts. The disease easily is confused with spray residues on leaves or bracts, especially if using electrostatic sprayers.


","Early detection with regular scouting is very important.

1) Space plants for good air circulation.

2) Circulate the air in the greenhouse using fans.

Poinsettia ,(Euphorbia pulcherrima)-Pythium Root Rot,"Pythium ultimum, P. aphanidermatum (found more often on roots in the Northeast United States), and other Pythium spp., fungal-like organisms. Problems with particular species may appear at different times of the year since different species have different temperature requirements. The organism may be in roots of new cuttings. It enters roots damaged by high soluble salts, either from overfertilization or from letting the rooting medium dry out, even for short periods, during propagation. The cultivar Freedom does not need as much fertilizer and could be damaged more easily than other cultivars. Cool, wet soils also favor the disease. Generally more a problem as plants mature.


","Diseased roots are discolored brown and/or appear water soaked. Fine roots turn mushy and slough off leaving mostly thicker, older roots behind. The root cortex of the smaller roots can often be easily slipped off, thus leaving a white cylinder of vascular tissue behind. Root rot causes lower leaves to yellow, wilt, and roll. Marginal leaf burning may also be one of the first symptoms found. Plants may remain stunted and flower prematurely. Plants also can wilt and die suddenly, especially if soluble salts are high. A cutting rot can also occur where the cutting is brown and has a water-soaked appearance. The callus and any new roots at the base of the cutting also turn brown. Can be confused with Phytophthora or Fusarium root rots.


","This disease is difficult to control once it has begun. Focus on preventing the disease before it begins by eliminating the pathogen from the production system. Clean growing surfaces, clean water, and handling practices, along with soilless media are all helpful.

1) Grow the plants at 69°F to 76°F and at a recommended pH range of 5.8 to 6.2

2) Plant pathogen-free cuttings. Inspect carefully before planting.

3) Use soilless potting mix or steam-treated soil and rooting media. Steam 30 min. at 180°F. Also disinfect any tools and equipment that might be used and contaminate the media.

4) Use suppressive growing media such as composted pine, fir, or hardwood bark or Canadian sphagnum peat at the H2 level of decomposition.

5) Use new pots, trays, or treat any reused items with a disinfectant, use steam, or solarization techniques (such as with anti-condensation film) to clean them.

6) Do not overfertilize or let plants dry out. Fertilize less as plants mature. Monitor soluble salt concentrations regularly keeping the EC below 2.0 early and 1.2 later.

7) Remove and destroy any diseased plants before planting or during the growing cycle. Do not contaminate adjacent pots while removing dead plants.

8) Trial different cultivars to see which might be more easily managed in your production facility.

","Use only with cultural controls. Drench pots thoroughly and not through a drip system. Rotate among fungicides with different modes of action. Isolates of the fungus resistant to Group 4 fungicides have been detected in the Northeast United States. Limit the use of any one group during crop production.

Poinsettia ,(Euphorbia pulcherrima)-Root and Stem Rot,"Rhizoctonia solani, a soilborne fungus favored by high greenhouse (soil) temperatures. Root rot increases as soil temperatures between 62°F and 79°F. It generally causes loss during rooting and can enter cuttings through wounds. Wounds from salt accumulation at the soil line also can be entry points. It survives in the soil as sclerotia or as mycelium colonizing bits of organic matter. The fungus can form knots of mycelium that develop into sclerotia. These are released into the soil as the plant debris decomposes.


","A brown dry canker on the cutting's stem at the infection site. The canker enlarges up the stem and down into roots. Cuttings wilt and die. Less often, roots rot in older plants, causing lower leaves to yellow, wilt, and roll. The plant is stunted and finally dies. Lesions usually start at the soil line, and infected roots usually are brown. Brown-cankered crown rots can occur without root rot. Longitudinal cracking and a dry appearance of the rotted crown tissue often develop on older plants.

Poplar ,(Populus spp.)-Bacterial Blight,"Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae, a bacterium. This is one of the limiting factors in seedling production in the Pacific Northwest. Fluctuating temperatures at or below freezing can intensify symptoms. The disease has been attributed to frost damage in the past. Two common genetic traits increase the bacteria's ability to cause disease. Most produce a powerful plant toxin, syringomycin, which destroys plant tissues as bacteria multiply in a wound. Bacteria also produce a protein that acts as an ice nucleus, increasing frost wounds that bacteria easily colonize and expand.


","Leaf spot and shoot dieback. Cankers with longitudinal cracks also can develop on the south side of trunks and branches. An exudate may be found dripping down damaged stems. Bark near the canker has a papery, glassy appearance. The vascular cambium is discolored beyond the cankered area but does not extend into the roots.

Poplar ,(Populus spp.)-Canker,"Cytospora chrysosperma (sexual: Valsa sordida) has been reported from all three Pacific Northwest States, and Cytosporea nivea (formerly Leucostoma niveum) has been reported from Washington. Widespread and common on poplar, cottonwood, aspen, and willow; occasionally on mountain ash, maple, and cherry. Although the disease is found on many hosts, the fungi responsible may be host specific. Isolates from aspen or cottonwood were not pathogenic on alder, ash, elm or willow but were able to infect each other. The disease can be serious, especially on Lombardy and silverleaf poplars. The fungi enter trees through wounds. Weakened trees are more susceptible.
Dothichiza canker, caused by Plagiostoma populinum (formerly Cryptodiaporthe populea), was found killing Lombardy poplar trees in Portland, OR in 2005 and in the Seattle, Washington area in 2013. The disease is widespread on Lombardy poplar in North America and Europe in landscape settings. Willow and Bolleana poplar are also susceptible while aspen and white poplar are tolerant. Infection occurs during wet weather in the winter on wounded tissue or in autumn via leaf scars. Very similar to Valsa canker.
Other important cankers on Populus spp. include Entoleuca mammata (formerly Hypoxylon mammatum) on aspen, and Ceratocystis fimbriata (target canker), none of which has been reported from the Pacific Northwest. However, other Hypoxylon spp. have been reported for Oregon and Idaho.


","Cytospora canker-Young twigs develop brownish, sunken, roughly circular areas in the bark. The fungus may grow down the twig and into larger branches on the trunk. Large cankers may be on branches and trunks. Infected bark discolors to orange or orange-brown and eventually darkens to black. This orange-brown bark discoloration is the most common and easily observed symptom and is frequently accompanied by an orange-brown liquid ooze. Pycnidia in the bark give the canker surface a pimpled appearance. Later, perithecial stroma develop in the dead, cankered areas. Twigs and smaller branches may die back without definite cankers.
Dothichiza canker-Cankers appear in all sizes and age classes of stems but most frequestly on twigs and small branches, especially in branch axils. Dieback occurs when cankers finally girdle the stem. Tissue beneath cankers is discolored. Adventitious sprouts frequently develop below cankered areas and then become infected as well. Pycnidia are often found within the cankered tissue very similar in appearance to Cytospora canker.


","

1) Keep trees in good vigor and avoid wounding.

2) Remove and destroy dead or severely cankered branches.

Poplar ,(Populus spp.)-Leaf and Shoot Blight,"The fungus Venturia populina is found on Lombardy poplar (P. nigra 'Italica') and eastern cottonwood (P. deltoides). The fungus Venturia inopina is found on black cottonwood (Populus trichocarpa) and on other Populus spp. in selections Tacamaha and Aigeiros and their hybrids. There may be some disagreement on the fungal names but isolates from Lombardy poplar did not infect black cottonwood or visa versa. The disease has caused extensive damage to older, established Lombardy poplars in areas of western Washington. Venturia macularis (formerly V. tremulae) is found on aspen (P. tremuloides).
These fungi overwinter in infected shoots but not in leaves. Spores are produced in wet spring weather, ascospores ejected from overwintered pseudothecia and overwintered conidia. Immature and young shoots are susceptible to infection but become resistant as tissues age.


","A variety of brown to black leaf spots and blights on leaf tips and margins. Necrotic areas expand rapidly; killing whole leaves and shoots. Shoot dieback is characterized by a ""shepherd's crook"" appearance of the blackened terminals. Lesions generally do not extend into woody tissues. Velvety mats of olive-green conidia occur on leaf spots and shepherd's crooks. Affected tissues dry out and become brittle. Disease impact is greatest on younger trees. Repeated blighting for several years results in stunted and malformed trees. Spring frost damage can be confused with shoot blight but frost damage is usually found more widespread and higher up on trees.

Poplar ,(Populus spp.)-Leaf Rust,"Several species of Melampsora can affect different Populus species in the Pacific Northwest. M. occidentalis affects Populus trichocarpa, or native black cottonwood, but generally not interspecific hybrids; M. medusae (formerly M. albertensis) affects aspen; Melampsora x columbiana, the hybrid of introduced M. medusae and M. occidentalis affects hybrid cottonwoods and some populations of P. trichocarpa in the region; and Eurasian M. laricis-populina can affect many hybrid cottonwoods, Lombardy poplars, and black cottonwoods. On hybrid cottonwoods, leaf rust is most typically caused by the now widespread M. x columbiana. Although M. laricis-populina has potential to damage a number of poplars and cottonwoods, in the Northwest its distribution still is restricted. It is much more widely distributed in California.
Melampsora rust fungi overwinter as telia on fallen poplar leaves. In spring, the telia produce basidiospores, which infect the current-season needles of conifer hosts. Most commonly the coniferous aecial host is Douglas-fir, but species of Larix (larch) also host poplar-infecting Melampsora. Pine seedlings can be infected if artificially inoculated with basidiospores but pines near hybrid poplar planations are not known to host poplar-infecting Melampsora. Yellow aecia develop on the needles, and the wind disperses aeciospores to nearby poplars. Uredinia then develop on the poplar host. Humid or moist conditions favor urediniospore production. Wind can disperse urediniospores long distances. Under optimal conditions, Melampsora species may undergo multiple cycles on the poplar uredinial host until leaf abscission. In late summer, telia begin to form in place of uredinia. M. laricis-populina also has been reported to overwinter as uredinial mycelia in evergreen poplars.
Repeated early leaf loss due to rust can reduce growth and yield during the following growing season. Susceptible clones may be predisposed to winter injury.


","In midsummer, small bright-yellow to orange pustules (uredinia) develop on the top, bottom, or both surfaces of leaves, depending on the species of Melampsora. An angular yellow area may be on the side of the leaf opposite the pustule. Heavy infections may cause defoliation and may lead to a premature, fall budbreak or predispose trees to other diseases and to cold damage. In autumn, black angular areas (telia) develop in infected tissue.


","

1) Keep susceptible conifers 500 yards away from poplar stock.

2) If possible, plant only hybrid poplar clones resistant to leaf rust, particularly that caused by .  . Plantings should be regularly monitored since pathogenic variation is now common in the rust population.

Potato ,"(Solanum tuberosum)-Bacterial Soft Rot, Blackleg, and Lenticel Rot","The bacterium, Pectobacterium carotovorum subsp. atrosepticum (syn. Erwinia carotovora subsp. atroseptica), is usually associated with blackleg and soft rot in storage while P. carotovorum subsp. carotovorum (syn. E. c. subsp. carotovora) is associated with aerial stem rot, lenticel rot, and soft rot. Moist, cool (below 70°F) conditions enhance blackleg while warmer conditions (70°F to 80°F) are optimal for soft rot. Another bacterium, Dickeya dianthicola, has been found in the Eastern United States and is associated with poor stands, blackleg under warmer temperatures, and decayed daughter tubers in affected fields on the east coast. The bacteria can be splashed on to plants by rain or irrigation causing aerial stem rot, and if present in surface irrigation water, can cause infections of leaf petioles and plant stems. These bacteria can survive on many weedy plants (nightshades, lambsquarters, pigweeds, purslane, etc.). They also reside in tuber lenticels without causing symptoms but can cause disease if tubers with lenticel populations are used for seed. So the principal source of inoculum for blackleg is contaminated seed tubers. The bacteria can be spread among seed pieces by machinery and handling, moving from diseased to healthy seed pieces during cutting.


","Blackleg-leaves curl up; foliage gradually yellows and a wilt, due to root and stem rotting, generally happens prior to or at row closure. Often at the soil line or above, mushy light brown to blue to inky black lesions develop. Belowground stems are the same color. Aerial tubers also may form on stems. Tuber rot usually begins at the stem end and results in a black, slimy rot. Lenticel rot occurs after washing prior to packing in fresh-market potatoes. These bacteria are present in soil and water. The problem is most often seen when packing potatoes directly from the field when pulp temperatures are warm.
Aerial stem soft rot-symptoms are in the upper canopy and do not involve the stems below ground. Lesions range from light brown to colorless. Stems still get very mushy and hollow and may be filled with mucilaginous slime. Often this disease is a secondary infection associated with stem infections by late blight.
Soft rot of tubers-on tubers, lesions can be as small as a single eye or involve the entire tuber. The rot is extremely soft and colorless. Although rot of the soft-rot bacterium is relatively odor free, secondary organisms usually cause a foul smell.
Lenticel rot-the area around affected lenticels is initially swollen and wet, but will dry into small, sunken areas around each colonized lenticel.


","

1) Minimize the bacterial contamination in seed tubers (Buy seed free of bacterial soft rot damage).

2) Sanitize and disinfest seed-handling equipment. Before cutting, hold tubers at 50°F to 55°F at 95% relative humidity for 10 to 14 days.

3) Avoid injuring seed tubers and allow cut seed to heal before planting.

4) Crop rotation will help reduce the disease.

5) Avoid planting in overly wet or dry soil; plant when soil temperature is 50°F or warmer.

6) Avoid over-irrigation, otherwise high disease levels may occur even when using the best quality seed pieces. More frequent irrigation for a shorter time is less favorable for disease. Avoid irrigating with surface water when growing potatoes for seed.

7) Do not harvest until tubers are fully mature (after skins ""set"" and lenticels are closed); injuries will be reduced.

8) Do not harvest when pulp temperatures are high.

9) Avoid tuber injuries.

10) Provide adequate air flow to promote drying, particularly when tubers first enter storage. Avoid packing and storing wet tubers.

11) Dry potatoes completely before placing to boxes or bags and shrink wrapping.

","


1) Firewall at 100 ppm. Soak cut seed pieces in solution for several minutes. 12-hr reentry.

2) Use a disinfectant when washing tubers to prevent lenticel infection. Spray a chlorine disinfectant such as sodium hypochlorite (Ultra Clorox Germicidal Bleach) at rates to give 75 ppm available chlorine. When washing tubers be certain to always maintain sufficient disinfectant to ensure bacteria are killed in the wash water. Check water frequently to maintain proper disinfectant level. Dip treatments lose activity rapidly, and the dip solution then spreads the bacteria.

Potato ,(Solanum tuberosum)-Black Dot,"Colletotrichum coccodes, a fungus with a wide host range in many potato-growing regions.


","The fungus forms many minute, black sclerotia on senescent potato tissue (including roots, stolons, tubers, and stems) especially toward the end of the growing season, causing root and stolon necrosis. Leaves of affected plants may progressively yellow and wilt. The stem yellows, browns, and dries; then sclerotia appear at the base up to several inches above soil level. Other symptoms, such as dark, necrotic, sunken lesions on stems, petioles, and veins, may occur also. Lesions may advance, causing the affected stem to die back or completely wilt. Infection on tubers impact the surface appearance and can be confused with silver scurf.


","

1) Do not plant seed potatoes from fields with a history of high incidence of black dot.

2) Crop rotation (2 to 3 years) may help reduce the inoculum level in the soil.

3) Carefully manage water and fertilization to avoid crop stress.

Potato ,(Solanum tuberosum)-Black Spot (Internal Black Spot),"A physiological disorder associated with low moisture content of the tuber at harvest, bruising, low storage temperatures, and potash deficiency. Bruising increases rapidly when the pulp of potatoes being harvested drops below 47°F to 50°F (8.33°C to 10°C). Desiccation (pressure flatting) increases black spot when potatoes are handled.


","Internal black spots usually are at the tuber's stem end. White, smooth-skinned cultivars are more susceptible.


","

1) Maintain a high potash level in soil.

2) Maintain at least 50% of available soil moisture until harvest.

3) Handle tubers carefully.

4) Store at 40°F to 45°F. Warm to 70°F and hold 2 days before handling. Hold French fry and chipping potatoes at 47°F to 50°F.

Potato ,(Solanum tuberosum)-Calico,"The Alfalfa mosaic virus is carried in tubers, but aphids can transmit it from alfalfa plants to potato plants by feeding first on infected plants and then probing noninfected plants. Nearby alfalfa fields or volunteer infected alfalfa plants in potato fields can be a source of inoculum.


","Large, irregular, yellow to cream-color spots appear on leaves. Tubers may show internal brown necrotic areas.

Potato ,(Solanum tuberosum)-Corky Ringspot,"Tobacco rattle virus is transmitted by soilborne nematodes, Trichodorus spp. and Paratrichodorus spp. The disease is widely scattered in the Pacific Northwest and can cause extensive damage. In central Oregon, corky ringspot has been severe when potatoes follow mint. All currently grown cultivars appear susceptible.


","There usually is no apparent foliage symptom under field conditions. Internal symptoms are generally necrotic arcs or brown spots but larger necrotic areas can sometimes be seen. Can be confused with symptoms caused by Potato Mop-Top Virus and Potato Virus Y (PVY). Arcs on the surface of tubers can be sometimes seen in smooth skin cultivars.


","

1) Do not plant potatoes in fields with a known corky ringspot history without proper chemical control (see below). Fields with unknown history should be sampled for the presence of the nematode (stubby root) and then assayed for the virus. Failure to adequately control this disease can result in complete loss.

2) Control nightshade, pigweed, and purslane while rotating out of potatoes to reduce the virus reservoir.

","Control of the nematode vector is mandatory if the field has a history of the disease.


1) Use Telone II as a preplant fumigant at recommended rates.

2) Vydate C-LV at recommended rates at planting and on recommended intervals during the crop season will suppress nematode poulations.

",
Potato ,(Solanum tuberosum)-Early Blight,"Alternaria solani, a fungus that overwinters as viable mycelium and spores in infected crop residue. Heavy dews and frequent rains seem essential for severe outbreaks. The disease is found primarily under sprinkler irrigation. Reduced fertility often is associated with infection. Alternaria alternata can sometimes be found in leaf and stem spot outbreaks and is more commonly found now than prior to 2000, probably due to repeated use of new fungicides. Severe outbreaks have been observed after hailstorm injury in potato growing in the Treasure Valley.


","First, oval or angular dark brown to black ""target"" spots appear on leaflets. There usually is a narrow chlorotic zone around the spot, which fades into the normal green. Lowest, oldest leaves are infected first, and they droop and dry as the disease progresses. If spots are numerous, they kill leaves and consequently may reduce yield.
Tuber infection is less frequent than leaf infection. Tuber lesions are sunken spots, brown to black, from 0.12 inch to 0.37 inch in diameter, and normally circular. The margin between diseased and healthy tubers is usually quite well defined. Underlying tissue shows a brown, corky, dry rot more than 0.12 inch deep.


","

1) Rotate out of potatoes for 2 years.

2) Sprinkler irrigation should allow foliage to dry rapidly after irrigation. Avoid irrigation in cool, cloudy periods. Also, avoid open lenticels by timing the end of irrigation.

3) High soil fertility reduces disease severity.

4) Harvest only when tubers are fully mature.

5) Handle tubers carefully to avoid bruising.

6) Rake and burn vines before harvest.

7) Store tubers under conditions that promote rapid suberization.

Potato ,(Solanum tuberosum)-Fusarium Dry Rot,"Several Fusarium spp., including F. sambucinum, F. solani var. coeruleum and F. avenaceum, can cause dry rot. These fungi survive on refuse and live in soil. Infections can originate from infested seed tubers. Tuber rot usually does not occur unless the tuber is injured during harvest. Wounds provide a way for the fungus associated with soil to enter the tuber. Dry rot is one of the most common storage diseases in Idaho. Fusarium dry rot leads to secondary infections by soft rot bacteria.


","A dry rot of the tuber starts from a wound or bruise and is at first small and brown. Mold on the rotting tuber may be white, rose, or violet. As the rot progresses, a cavity begins to form, the tuber mummifies and ultimately only the dry shell persists.
Lesions from F. solani var. coeruleum infections start at the side of the infection and progress in a fairly uniform manner through the tuber. As lesions age, rots turn yellow to brown. Lesions caused by F. sambucinum tend to be very dark brown to black and progress through the tuber in a very irregular manner sometimes called ""tunneling.""

Potato ,(Solanum tuberosum)-Late Blight,"The fungus-like microorganism, Phytophthora infestans, survives in tubers in cull piles or on tubers left in harvested fields, on seed potatoes, or is blown in as spores with rainstorms. Spores (sporangia) form on infected culls, volunteers, or crop plants. Rain or irrigation spread sporangia to healthy tissue. Sporangia can germinate on a wet leaf or stem and penetrate either directly through the cuticle or a stomate. Under cool, wet conditions, sporangia can produce swimming spores (zoospores). The leaf or stem is colonized quickly, and large portions become necrotic as the microbe advances. At the lesion's margin, new sporangia form through the stomata to continue the disease cycle. With favorable conditions, the pathogen can complete one cycle in as little as 4 days. Many cycles can occur in the growing season. Sporangia and/or zoospores also can infect tubers throughout their development or at harvest or in storage. If potatoes with late blight are stored, the blight can directly or indirectly damage tubers. Indirect damage occurs when secondary infection, by soft rot bacteria, rots the infected tuber and then spread to other tubers below in the pile. This can be a very serious problem in storage.
In the 1990s, isolates resistant to Ridomil (metalaxyl) were found, as was a second mating type discovered in the Pacific Northwest. Most isolates are resistant to Ridomil and its use is not recommended. The occurrence of a second mating type allows for the formation of a different survival structure, the oospore, providing an additional means for the fungus to overwinter, this time in the soil. The existence of compatible mating types also brings the risk of new strains that could be more difficult to control.
Nearly all potato cultivars are susceptible to late blight. Cultivars Norchip, Hilite, Russet Norkotah, Superior, Shepody, and Red LaSoda are more susceptible than Russet Burbank. The cultivar White Rose is similar to Russet Burbank in susceptibility. Cultivars Norkotah, Russet Ranger, and Shepody are especially susceptible to late blight tuber rot. A relatively new cultivar, Premier Russet, is moderately resistant. Fields should be scouted early and continuously, and the use of fungicides is required. Scout areas where water pools in the field, in low spots or wheel tracks, near the center of a center pivot irrigation system, and where irrigation overlaps occur.
The disease has been found throughout the PNW. The disease is often found in the Willamette Valley of Oregon and in northwestern Washington. Since 1991, yearly outbreaks have occurred in the Columbia Basin of Oregon and Washington. The disease is less often seen in Idaho and seldom seen in central Oregon or Klamath Falls.


","Water-soaked spots appear on leaves and stems, enlarge rapidly, and turn brown or black. Under humid conditions, a ring or surface of white mold may appear on the leaf underside at the lesion's edge. In cool, wet weather, blight may advance rapidly and ruin an entire field in a few days. Lesions, with the occurrence and duration of moisture, may be found in the lower canopy while none are visible in the drier, upper canopy.
Infected tuber skin at first is discolored brown to purple; later there is a brownish dry or wet rot. Blight infections on tubers usually become visible within the first month of storage, but symptoms may continue to appear throughout the storage season.


","Regular scouting for the disease is critical for all types of management strategies.

1) Eliminate cull piles from field or from storage before spring plantings. Bury under at least 2 ft of soil or feed to livestock prior to current year plantings.

2) Use certified pathogen-free seed. Do not buy seed from areas known to have had late blight the year the seed was grown.

3) Adequately hill plants to minimize the opportunity for sporangia to wash from the foliage into cracks or shallow areas of a hill and then to the tubers.

4) Control volunteer plants where possible.

5) Use irrigation management to limit disease spread. Don't water during rain storms, or soon thereafter, to reduce time water is on foliage. Watering at night prolongs moisture on leaves and should be avoided when late blight pressure is high. Use of solid set or wheel line systems for more than 4 hours is not recommended.

6) To minimize tuber infection and facilitate decomposition of infected tubers, do not dig potatoes from late blight-infected fields until 14 days after frost or herbicides kill vines completely (no green stems).

7) Do not harvest when soil is excessively wet.

8) Provide adequate air flow in storage to prevent free water or surface moisture from forming on tubers. Late blight spores can spread in storage if temperatures are above 40°F and will infect new potatoes if there is free moisture on tubers for 12 hours or more.

9) West of the Cascade Range, potatoes planted early in spring and harvested before wet weather in fall are more likely to escape severe infection.

10) Do not plant the first one-half of the first tower from the center pivot to avoid providing conditions for the organism to become established in the field.

","Consult your local university Extension office for information on materials registered under Section 18. In western Oregon and Washington, apply protectant fungicides every 7 days starting at 6 inches of shoot growth. In the Columbia Basin, apply protectant fungicides beginning just before between-row closure. It is extremely important to begin fungicide applications prior to infection.
Using Ridomil products will not provide control due to resistance in strains currently found.
Seed treatments can reduce the chance of spread of late blight from seed and prevent spread of late blight between seed pieces during cutting, treating, and handling operations.


If weather, such as heavy rain, favors late-blight infection, apply at 5- to 7-day intervals. Some formulations may be applied by solid-set and circle sprinkler systems. Treat vines with protectant fungicides, even after die-down, as long as vines are still green. Several forecasting programs are available that use local weather data to help time applications, contact your local extension office for more information.

Potato ,(Solanum tuberosum)-Latent Viruses,"Several viruses including Potato virus X (PVX), Potato virus Y (PVY), Potato virus S (PVS), and Potato virus A (PVA). These viruses are transmitted mechanically and by insects, primarily aphids. Research shows that PVX in combination with PVS reduces yields 10% to 25%, and PVY can reduce yields, particularly in the high-yielding, long-growing season of the Columbia Basin, when growing most cultivars. Besides yield reduction, the occurrence of PVY ""strains"" can also result in tuber quality issues. zzSecondary spread from plants growing from infected seed can occur. The amount of virus allowed in certified potatoes differs between states.


","The viruses normally do not cause obvious symptoms in most popular potato cultivars, hence the designation ""latent."" Infection may cause a mild mottle or slightly distort leaves to an easily recognized ""mosaic"" symptom. Infection in the cultivars Shepody and Russet Norkotah are extremely difficult to see, whereas a more easily seen mosaic pattern can be found in Russet Burbank. A severe reaction and plant death may result from infection in the cultivar Ranger Russet. Specific and severe symptoms may occur when two or more of the viruses infect the plant at the same time. Tuber symptoms can occur due to infection by strains of PVY. Of particular importance are PVYn:o and PVYntn. These strains can cause substantial internal necrosis in cultivars Russet Ranger, Yukon Gold, Yukon Gem, and Alturas. Other cultivars can also be impacted. Infection in many of these cultivars can be seen on the tubers surface as either raised or sunken areas on the tuber surface, particularly on smooth skin cultivars.


","Use seed from a certification program that tests for latent viruses. Use both field data and winter grow-out information to select seed lots. Then take the following steps to prevent introducing and spreading viruses within the crop.

1) Disinfect cutting and planting equipment before use. See materials under Potato-Ring Rot.

2) Avoid cutting sprouted seed tubers.

3) Minimize cultivation to prevent spreading the disease mechanically. Cultivate when vines are dry. Disinfect cultivation equipment when moving from a latent-virus-infected field to one that is not. Better yet, use one set of equipment only in the virus-free fields.

4) Solid-set irrigation will decrease mechanical spread.

5) If a seed grower, rogue all infected plants, including daughter tubers. Do it early in the season before vines touch. Later, rogue when the vines are dry. Immediately place rogued vines and tubers in a clean sack to prevent spread as you move down the rows.

","Control aphids. Preventing spread into a field is unlikely but controlling the spread of these viruses in a field is possible with insecticide use. See the PNW Insect Management Handbook for details.

Potato ,(Solanum tuberosum)-Leak,"Pythium debaryanum and P. ultimum, soilborne fungus-like microorganisms. The disease is associated with high temperatures at digging time or in early storage and shipment and care should be taken to avoid damaging tubers at harvest. The pathogen is attracted to the tuber's skin and can attack directly. Irrigation practices do affect disease incidence. Overwatering, clearly shown by increased incidence in the first tower of a center pivot irrigation system where more water is applied, does impact disease levels. Usually major losses in the field do not occur. This disease can result in substantial damage in storage as infected tubers rot due to secondary infections by soft-rotting bacteria.
Resistance to the commonly used fungicide Ridomil has been reported in the Columbia Basin, much less so in Idaho. Field sampling has confirmed resistant isolates making up more than 90% of the Pythium population.


","Decayed tissue is brown or gray; its uniform texture resembles a soft, watery paste. Margins of rotted tissues are sharply defined and darker in color. Tubers may develop a sour odor. They may eventually dry and mummify. Generally this disease rots the tuber from the inside out, leaving only a thin papery shell, sometimes called ""shell rot."" Rots to tubers are also caused by late blight, bacterial rot, and pink rot. While infection may start in the field or from harvest, these symptoms are commonly found in storage.


","

1) Prevent tuber injury during harvest.

2) Keep tubers as cool and dry as possible during harvest.

3) Store promptly at low temperature (45°F to 50°F).

4) Maintain storage at 90% to 95% relative humidity as soon as tuber surfaces dry.

","One application when plants are flowering has been shown effective in Colorado. A second application two weeks following the first application has an increased benefit. New in-furrow application at planting reduces cost over two aerial applications. Where high levels of resistance are present, use of this material is not recommended. Soil tests can determine levels of resistance in field soils.


1) Agri-Fos at 2 to 5 quarts/A in 10 gal water as a furrow spray applied in a band spray directly over top of row just before row is closed or 1.25 quarts/A in 90 to 375 gal water applied as a foliar spray on 5- to 14-day intervals 4-hr reentry.

Potato ,"(Solanum tuberosum)-Nematode, Potato Cyst","Globodera pallida (white cyst nematode) was confirmed during 2006 in Idaho and Golden potato cyst nematode (G. rostochiensis) was found in British Columbia during 1965. A different species (Globodera ellingtonae) was detected on the OSU Powell Butte experiment station, where it has been contained; it has not been found elsewhere in Oregon. Quarantine of areas affected was enacted. Host range is limited; potato, tomato, eggplant, and weedy species of Solanum. If left uncontrolled, these nematodes can cause tremendous loss in tuber yield. Cysts, consisting of the bodies of dead females, contain from 200 to 600 eggs and may survive 20 years or more in soil.

Potato ,"(Solanum tuberosum)-Nematode, Root-knot","The northern (Meloidogyne hapla) and Columbia (M. chitwoodi) root-knot nematodes are among the most important problems in potato production. Very low soil populations can result in significant damage. Both nematodes blemish tubers and may render them unmarketable. M. chitwoodi is more important than M. hapla, causing more severe tuber damage. Both are sedentary endoparasites, and only the second-stage juveniles (the infective stage) and adult males (which may be rare) are present in soil. The disease spreads by infected tubers (seed or commercial), reused irrigation water and via soil. M. chitwoodi continues to develop above 41°F, but M. hapla is not active below 50°F. M. chitwoodi can migrate up from 3 feet deep, particularly in sandy soils, and cause economically significant tuber damage.


","Root-knot nematode infection rarely causes aboveground symptoms in potatoes. External symptoms of M. chitwoodi are distinct pimple-like bumps and lumps on tubers. M. hapla usually produces a more general swelling on the tuber or none at all. Both species produce brown spots within the vascular ring, within 0.25 inch of the tuber surface. Brown spots are about 0.04 inch (1 mm) in diameter and are evident only when the female nematode begins egg production. The female's white body and egg sac containing eggs (egg mass) produced outside the body often can be seen with a hand lens in the center of the brown spot. Unless several nematodes are in the same area, the spots' borders are distinct. The spots should not be confused with symptoms of heat necrosis, which produces spots of similar size but more diffused. Tubers infected with late season infection of M. chitwoodi may not show visible external or internal symptoms at harvest but may develop them in storage.


","

1) Use only certified seed inspected for nematodes.

2) Do not return tare dirt from potato or other crops to your farm.

3) Avoid moving soil from infested farms or fields by cleaning machinery and equipment.

4) Avoid using waste ditch water for irrigation. Settling ponds reduce nematode spread; nematodes settle to the bottom and eventually die. Siphon water from near the water surface.

5) Use non-host crops such as cereals in rotation with potato to suppress or minimize population increases of . Most rotation crops, particularly cereals, are good hosts for  but short-season crops, such as wheat or sweet corn, reduce the number of generations of  compared to long-season crops such as field corn. Short-season crops also may provide time for a green manure crop (see cultural control #9 below) to be planted in late summer. When growing corn and wheat in rotation, growing corn one year and then wheat the next increases populations of  to a lesser extent than wheat followed by corn. Growing lima bean followed by a green manure crop the year before potato can markedly reduce levels of . Green pea can be planted before lima bean to provide additional revenue.  has two races, one in which alfalfa is a host (race 2) and one in which alfalfa is not a host (race 1). Alfalfa can suppress root-knot if  race 1 alone is present but not in the presence of a mixed population of races 1 and 2, or when  is present.

6) Weed control within rotation crops is critical because many weeds are suitable hosts for root-knot nematodes.

7) Plan an early harvest in fields infested with , even if using proper control measures. Harvest as soon after vine kill as possible. Do not leave tubers in the ground for a long period after vines have died.

8) Avoid storing tubers harvested from a field infested with .

9) Green manure crops such as sudangrass ('Trudan 8' or 'Sordan 79') and rapeseed ('Humus') effectively suppress nematode populations. These are grown after short-season crops such as wheat or sweet corn, in early August. Sudangrass is incorporated in fall before frost, rapeseed in spring 3 to 4 weeks before planting potatoes.  has been adequately controlled when chemical controls have been used along with these green manure crops. New green manure crops are being developed. Check with a local extension agent to obtain information on the performance of cultivars currently available.

","No control technique ever eliminates nematodes from soil, and eventually they infect tubers. However, these recommendations have been shown to work well to reduce the disease's impact with proper fungicide use and when following soil sampling recommendations.


1) Soil fumigation in fall is highly recommended, but spring fumigation is possible if criteria for fumigation conditions are met. Generally, soil temperatures and moisture for fumigation are better in fall than spring. In addition, nematode populations are more active in fall and therefore more susceptible.

1.1) Metam sodium (Vapam HL, Sectagon 42) can reduce nematode populations. In certain fields sprinkler-applied (1 inch of water) metam sodium cannot adequately reduce nematodes 2 to 3 feet deep in soil. For best control, apply metam sodium as a broadcast spray at a depth of 14 to 16 inches, using a Noble plow or similar shanks with spray nozzles attached, at an appropriate rate specifically-targeted toward nematode control and not soilborne fungi. Follow by metam sodium applied on the surface via sprinkler or sprayed on the surface and incorporated by discing 4 to 6 inches deep. Restricted-use pesticide. 48-hr reentry. 
1.2) Telone II at 9 to 14 gal/A for mineral soils, 18 gal/A for muck soils. 5-day reentry. Restricted-use pesticide.
1.3) Telone C-17 at 24 gal/A for mineral soils and at 30 gal/A for muck soils. 5-day reentry. Restricted-use pesticide.
2) Mocap EC at 1 to 2 gal/A to control  and suppress . For best results with , use Mocap EC at 2 gal/A in combination with soil fumigation. Mocap EC protects the treated area from migrating nematodes for 5 to 6 weeks. Broadcast Mocap EC as close to planting time as possible and incorporate immediately in the top 2 to 4 inches of soil by rototilling or discing. Best results are obtained with deep (6 to 8 inches), even incorporation. For  Mocap EC should be applied following fall or spring application of a registered fumigant nematicide. In the Columbia River Basin, it is strongly recommended that Mocap EC be applied following fall or spring application of a registered fumigant nematicide. Under severe infestation or long growing season conditions, Mocap EC may not adequately protect tuber quality. 48-hr reentry; 72-hr reentry where average rainfall is less than 25 inches/year.

3) Vydate C-LV can be used to suppress tuber damage from root-knot nematode. An in-furrow application at planting is recommended. For best results use Vydate in combination with a soil fumigant. Always precede Vydate with a shank-injected fumigant if preplant populations of  exceed 50/250 cc soil. For adequate protection several applications of Vydate are required. A degree-day (DD) model has been developed to optimize the timing of applications.

Potato ,"(Solanum tuberosum)-Nematode, Root-lesion","Pratylenchus neglectus is the most common root-lesion nematode found in the potato-growing areas of the Columbia Basin, eastern Oregon, and Idaho. P. penetrans is generally in a potato field that formerly grew tree fruits or mint but are beginning to be found more commonly in other situations. They are migratory endoparasites usually residing in roots but able to move in and out of roots. Both species have very wide host ranges, especially cereals and grasses. Studies in a loamy sand show that preplant soil populations of P. penetrans at 1000/250 cu cm of soil reduced 'Russet Burbank' potato yields, but P. neglectus did not at the same level. However, these nematodes' most important effect is that they can interact with pathogens associated with potato early dying, including the Verticillium wilt fungus. Plants infected primarily with P. penetrans are more susceptible to invasion by the early-dying disease pathogens, including the Verticillium wilt fungus (Verticillium dahliae) and the soft-rot bacteria (Pectobacterium carotovorum subsp. carotovorum (syn. Erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora). Pratylenchus penetrans can significantly increase the severity of potato early dying.


","These nematodes are not known to blemish tubers, and symptoms produced are not diagnostic. Root systems generally are reduced in size with few feeder roots and are darker in color. Short dash-like lesions can be found on roots and stolons. These areas can grow in size over time. The darkening generally is caused by secondary fungi and bacteria, which enter roots through wounds made by the nematode. Plants damaged by root-lesion nematodes may have long healthy roots near the soil surface but lower roots are severely damaged.


","

1) Weed control is critical because many weeds are suitable hosts for root-lesion nematodes.

2) Green manure crops such as sudangrass ('Trudan 8' or 'Sordan 79') may suppress populations of root-lesion nematodes. They can be grown after short-season crops, such as wheat or sweet corn, in early August. Incorporate sudangrass in fall before frost. Do not cut and let regrow-cutting removes nematode-suppressing ability. If cutting for hay, incorporate remaining vegetation as soon as possible.

","Chemical control is recommended particularly when high levels of P. penetrans are found during soil sampling. In the absence of potato early dying, it is not economical to control root-lesion nematodes with fumigation. Early dying is wide spread in the Columbia Basin and metam sodium use is recommended in that area. Fumigating for potato early dying or root-knot nematode also controls root-lesion nematodes.

2.1) Mocap EC at 1 to 12 gal/A mechanically incorporated by rototilling or discing just before planting. Broadcast Mocap as close to planting time as possible and immediately incorporate in the top 2 to 4 inches of soil. Best results are obtained with deep (6 to 8 inches), even incorporation. Generally, Mocap EC should be applied following fall or spring application of a registered fumigant nematicide. In the Columbia River Basin, it is strongly recommended that Mocap EC be applied following fall or spring application of a registered fumigant nematicide.

For optimum performance, use 2.1 to 4.2 pints/A in-furrow at planting or 2.1 pints/A between 30 and 40 days after planting  Significant damage can occur if first Vydate application is not made before 40 days after planting. For best results, all applications other than in-furrow should be made via chemigation. See manufacture's label for details on application through sprinkler irrigation systems. Always buffer Vydate injection solution to a pH of 5.0 or lower. Do not apply within 7 days of harvest.

Potato ,(Solanum tuberosum)-Pink Rot,"Phytophthora erythroseptica, a soilborne fungus-like organism. The disease is directly associated with high soil moisture. It becomes a problem in storage by encouraging the development and spread of soft rot. Pink rot does not spread in storage by spore movement but grows from tuber to tuber.


","Internal rotted tissue is a dirty, creamy white at first, appearing water soaked yet leathery; the texture has been described as like a cooked potato. On exposure to air, with time it turns pink, later becoming darker brown. There is a definite margin between rotted and healthy tissue. This organism does not cause a cavity like that of dry rot or symptoms like Pythium leak since this organism infects the whole tuber, out to the surface, as it grows through the tuber.


","

When tubers are in storage, use high air flow initially to allow for healing and to remove excess moisture from the pile. Maintain appropriate air flow and humidity during storage so that infected tubers dry and do not cause additional damage in storage.

1) Avoid excessive soil moisture, especially late in the season, and provide good drainage.

2) Do not bring infected tubers into storage if possible. Remove wet tubers from storage.

","One application when plants are flowering has been shown effective in Colorado. A second application two weeks following the first application has an increased benefit. New in-furrow application at planting reduces cost over two aerial applications.


1) Agri-Fos at 2 to 5 quarts/A in 10 gal water as a furrow spray applied in a band spray directly over top of row just before row is closed or 1.25 quarts/A in 90 to 375 gal water applied as a foliar spray on 5- to 14-day intervals. 4-hr reentry.

",
Potato ,(Solanum tuberosum)-Potato Leafroll Virus (Leaf Roll),"The Potato leafroll virus (PLRV) is transmitted by at least 10 species of aphids, in a persistent manner. Once an aphid acquires the virus, it can transmit it for life, but not pass it on to its offspring. The green peach aphid is the most important vector in our area. Infection may come from plants grown from infected tubers or from current season infection by aphids bringing the virus in from other sources. Potential damage is greatest from planting infected seed tubers since this provides a source of the virus in the potato field. Epidemics may be generated from as few as one infection center (e.g. one infected tuber) per acre when aphids are not controlled. The amount of virus allowed in certified potatoes differs among states.
In Idaho seed growing areas, plants purchased for home gardens have been found to harbor both the virus and aphid vectors.
Yield reduction (reduced numbers and size of tubers) is greatest for plants derived from infected tubers, followed by plants initially virus free but infected early in the season from viruliferous aphids. Mature plants show resistance. Besides yield loss, important losses also occur from tuber net necrosis, which occurs only from current season infection, not seedborne infection. Affected tubers are not suitable for fresh market, processing, or seed. Net necrosis is not seen in all cultivars.
Due to the use of new systemic insecticides in potatoes, PLRV is seldom seen in seed or in commercial plantings in the Columbia Basin.


","Plants from infected tubers show symptoms first on lower leaves. Leaves curl up around the midrib and may assume a leathery texture. Plants usually are yellowed and stunted, and older (lower) leaves may brown and die early. Symptoms are more obscure on plants that become infected during the current season. Leaf rolling occurs first on upper (younger) leaves; leaves may be pale green or chlorotic, with purple or reddish borders. Early-season infection may result in symptoms typical of tuberborne leaf roll.
Infected tubers of 'Russet Burbank' may show ""net necrosis"": small brown speckles or strands of discolored tissue that start at the tuber's stem end and which may extend as far as halfway through the tuber. The cultivars White Rose, Norgold, and others do not develop as severe a net necrosis. Net necrosis can occur in the absence of foliar symptoms when plants are infected after leaves have stopped growing but tuber expansion continues. Incidence of net necrosis increases during prolonged storage, especially in medium and small tubers. Net necrosis can be confused with Zebra Chip.


","

1) Use certified seed potatoes with the lowest virus level.

2) Rogue infected plants and tubers in seed fields. Because plants may be infected but not show symptoms, rogue out plants neighboring an affected plant by removal of the next three plants on each side of that affected plant.

3) Control winter annual weeds such as mustard and shepherd's purse, which can harbor the virus, in field borders.

4) Control volunteer potato plants and eliminate cull piles to reduce inoculum sources.

5) Do not store potatoes subject to net necrosis for long periods (more than 40 days).

6) For organic production and home gardens, resistant cultivars can reduce field spread but not eliminate the need for aphid control. Moderately resistant cultivars include Katahdin, Kennebec, Norland, Ranger Russet, Red Pontiac, Sangre, Shepody, and Yukon Gold. Resistant cultivars include Abnaki, Atlantic, Cascade, Chieftain, Chippewa, Penobscot, and Sebago. Avoid susceptible cultivars including Green Mountain, Russet Burbank, and Russet Norkotah.

","This virus is easily controlled by the use of insecticides. Monitor fields for aphid activity and control aphids. Early- and mid-season vector control is most crucial to prevent virus spread. Mid- to late-season control is important when growing cultivars susceptible to net necrosis. See PNW Insect Management Handbook for details.

Potato ,(Solanum tuberosum)-Potato Mop-Top Virus,"The Potato mop-top virus (PMTV) is a pomovirus vectored by the soilborne organism, Spongospora subterrenea, which causes powdery scab of potato (see Potato-Powdery Scab). The virus can be found in scab spore-balls and can remain viable in the field 18 years or longer without the host. PMTV can also be tuberborne.
Until 2001, PTMV was considered an exotic pathogen, found primarily in cooler growing regions around the world. It was detected in a few lots of processing potatoes from Idaho, Oregon, and Washington in 2001 but not in 2002. This virus has now been confirmed in many potato production areas in the United States and is commonly found where powdery scab is present. Tuber symptoms are not commonly found. Yield losses can be up to 20% in highly sensitive cultivars.


","Symptoms of PMTV vary depending on cultivar and environmental conditions. Foliar symptoms may include yellow rings, V shape markings, and blotches, especially on the lower leaves but these foliar symptoms are not usually seen. Stems may also be stunted, giving a ""mop top"" effect. Secondary infections may lead to parallel necrotic rings or arcs and cracking inside the tuber. These rings may not be present at harvest but may develop during storage. It can be confused with corky ringspot and diagnostic tests are usually needed to determine whether PMTV is present.


","

1) Plant only certified potato seed.

2) Do not move contaminated soil or equipment into clean fields.

3) Genetic resistance has not been identified in commercial lines.

Potato ,(Solanum tuberosum)-Potato Rugose Mosaic,"An aphid-transmitted virus, Potato virus Y, when combined with Potato virus X.


","Little mottling is present, but leaves are decidedly wrinkled and curled. Individual necrotic spots start and progress until the leaf dies. Lower leaves die first; sometimes leaving a stem with a tuft of wrinkled leaves at the tip.

1) Use certified seed potatoes.

2) Rogue out infected plants.

3) Control aphids. See  for details.

4) Avoid cultivating after potato plants are tall enough to hit the tool bar.

Potato ,(Solanum tuberosum)-Potato Wart,"Synchytrium endobioticum, a primitive parasitic fungus that does not occur in the United States. Potato wart was found on Prince Edward Island, Canada in 2000, and there was concern that it may have spread to other areas. So far the disease has not been found in other provinces of Canada or in the United States.


","The primary symptom is galls on tubers, stolons, and stems and occasionally on leaves but never on roots. These growths start out small and are tan to cream color on portions of the plant below ground; aerial galls or tuber galls exposed to the sun are green. With age, all galls turn brown and then black. Galls may be as small as a pea or the same size or larger than the host tuber.
The galls are formed of both host and fungal tissue. Once galls break down, the resistant survival structures (sporangia) of the fungus are released and may remain viable in the soil up to 30 to 40 years. There is no effective control once the disease is in a field; infested fields must be managed to prevent the organism's spread.
Leave suspect tubers or plants in place and report them to the state Department of Agriculture for confirmation of the disease.

Potato ,(Solanum tuberosum)-Powdery Mildew,"The fungus, Golovinomyces orontii (formerly Erysiphe cichoracearum; anamorph Euoidium violae), is reported throughout the world on a wide range of hosts, but the strain on potatoes is a distinct physiologic race. Row-irrigated potatoes are more likely to show infection than sprinkler-irrigated.


","Powdery mildew is not always as noticeable on potatoes as on other plants. It first appears on potatoes as brown lesions of various sizes on stems and petioles. Lesions coalesce to form short streaks or stippled patches. The white powdery coating typical of powdery mildews on most other hosts frequently does not develop on potatoes, but if the air is moist, diseased leaves eventually may be covered by it.
Leaves and stems are killed, and only the tip of the plant may remain green. In severe cases, vines collapse. Infection and vine collapse may be over large areas of the field. Late in the season, small black specks may develop in the powdery growth. These are chasmothecia, the overwintering fungal bodies.


","

1) Some cultivars are more susceptible than others. In general, cultivars such as Pontiac are more severely affected than the russet cultivars. The most susceptible of the common cultivars is Norgold followed by Kennebec and then Russet Burbank.

2) There is some evidence that early planting reduces loss.

","Most often this disease does not cause enough damage to warrant fungicide use.


1) JMS Stylet Oil at 3 to 6 quarts/100 gal water. Do not spray if temperature is below 50°F, above 90°F or when plants are wet or under heat or moisture stress. 4-hr reentry.

This disease caused substantial damage in 2002 in the Columbia Basin and additional damage during 2003. The main disease sources are infected potato seed, ladino clover, and perennial weeds.  Aster yellows, which is not commonly found, cannot be separated from BLTVA without laboratory testing.


","Tip leaves begin to roll up, and plants develop an off-green or yellowish cast. Aerial tubers form and leaves have a purplish cast. Interveinal leaf tissue may die, giving stems and leaf ribs a more prominent appearance. Plants may wilt quickly and fall over. Tubers are smaller, soft, and flabby.

1) Careful monitoring of the vector and timely applications of insecticides are very important. In the Columbia Basin area, leafhoppers migrate to potatoes as surrounding desert vegetation dries up. Use of products in mid-May to early June, when leafhoppers populations are increasing due to a natural buildup, will substantially reduce the amount of disease.

Potato ,(Solanum tuberosum)-Rhizoctonia Canker (Black Scurf),"Rhizoctonia solani, a fungus that is a common soil inhabitant and has a wide host range. Seed pieces can carry the fungus but soilborne inoculum can be equally as damaging.


","When sprouts are infected before emergence, they may be girdled and killed by reddish to dark brown girdling cankers found on the stems at or below ground. Stems seem to become more resistant to infection once they emerge. If plants are infected later in their development, they may have reddish-brown to brown lesions on stems, stolons, tubers, and roots. Aerial tubers may form on the stem if the fungus has girdled the stem below. Leaf curl, like that caused by the Potato leafroll virus, may occur. Tubers may have black bodies (scurf) on the surface and they are not easily removed. While the bodies do not affect the tuber's interior, enough of them on the surface of potatoes being grown for the fresh market will cause rejection.


","

1) Rotate out of potatoes, preferably for 3 years.

2) Shallow planting followed by gradual hilling-up speeds emergence and reduces damage.

3) Avoid over-irrigating early in the season. Cooling soil with irrigation slows emergence and favors the fungus.

4) If possible, avoid seed lots that contain sclerotia.

5) Warm seed before planting.

6) To encourage more rapid emergence, plant deep but cover with a shallow layer of soil.

7) The disease may be more severe when following sugar beets, alfalfa, or clover that was plowed down the spring of planting.

8) Delaying planting until soil temperatures warm and soil moisture is drier will reduce infection.

Potato ,(Solanum tuberosum)-Ring Rot,"A bacterium, Clavibacter michiganensis subsp. sepedonicus (formerly Corynebacterium sepedonicum), which overwinters in infected tubers or as a dried slime on machinery and sacks, in storage houses, etc. It does not overwinter in soil except in infected volunteer plants. Knives used during seed-cutting operations can easily spread ring rot bacteria from infected tubers to healthy tubers.


","Symptom expression varies by cultivar. Foliage generally does not show symptoms until mid to late in the growing season. The first symptom is a shortened internode length in the terminals. These bunchy or rosetted terminals are a darker green than the rest of the plant. A pronounced yellowing occurs between leaflet veins, and the leaflet margin rolls up and becomes necrotic.
A ""green wilt"" also may occur with or without the above symptoms. One or more stems in a hill may show symptoms while the rest appear normal. When affected stems are cut at the ground line and squeezed, a creamy white mass of bacteria may ooze from the water-conducting tissue.
Ring rot in tubers may not develop until they have been in storage several months, or it may be present at digging or before. When infected tubers are cut near the stem end, ring rot symptoms may appear as yellow or light brown rings of cheesy consistency in the tuber's vascular ring. In advanced tuber rot, dry gray pockets of decayed tissue surround the vascular ring. Secondary rots may completely destroy the tuber, either in the soil or in storage.


","

1) Use only certified seed potatoes.

2) Plant whole, single-drop seed. Avoid using picker planters because the pick spreads disease.

3) Disinfect cutting knives at least three (3) times a day when cutting a single lot of potato seed. Always disinfect before cutting a new seed lot.

4) Disinfect storage bins, tools, trucks, and other equipment frequently during cutting and planting operations. Always clean extensively before beginning seed handling operations at the start of the season.

","Disinfectants or fumigants with the following active ingredients are effective against bacterial ring rot. Check with your state Department of Agriculture to determine which formulations are acceptable for the area being cleaned. In general, disinfect by wetting the surface with the product for at least 10 min. Formaldehyde-based products are ineffective.


1) Copper 8-Quinolinolate (PQ 80). Use a 10 % solution in a 1:200 dilution.

2) Quaternary ammonium compounds at 5 oz of a 10% solution/10 gal water.

3) Sodium hypochlorite in a 1,000 to 2,000 ppm chlorine solution.

Potato ,"(Solanum tuberosum)-Scab, Common","Streptomyces scabies, a filamentous bacterium that lives in soil and on diseased tubers. Can also infect carrots, red beets, some other crops, and some weeds. Neutral or alkaline soils favor scab development. Russet cultivars are generally less affected than smooth-skinned cultivars and possibly can be grown where scab has been severe. Soils containing high levels of organic matter which is not fully-decomposed, can have more severe disease.


","Corky lesions appear on the tuber's surface. Lesions may be small and superficial or consist of deep pits. This disease may be confused with powdery scab.

Potato ,(Solanum tuberosum)-Seed Piece Decay,"Fusarium spp. and Pectobacterium carotovorum are commonly found when seed piece decay is present. Fusarium may invade the cut surface of seed tubers, especially when cut seed is held for extended periods before planting, followed by an invasion of Pectobacterium. Other pathogenic organisms may be present. Seed piece decay also can be a problem when planting in cool, wet soils, which impairs suberization of the cut surface, particularly when cold seed is planted into warmer ground. The cultivar Shepody may be more prone to this problem. Usually good quality seed, when properly stored and handled, rarely has this problem when correctly planted.

The disease can worsen in storage, beginning 3 to 4 months following storage, and ultimately result in substantial infection with longer storage. High humidity above 90% favors this disease. Smooth skin cultivars, particularly when grown in cooler soils with higher consistent soil moisture, may be severely infected at harvest. Russet cultivars are apparently not as susceptible. This disease is only a surface problem but nevertheless can cause substantial losses by disfiguring the tuber surface. Can occur with other tuber blemish diseases such as black scurf or black dot


","Small, light brown circular spots that tend to grow together and cover large areas of tubers. Sometimes scurf is an olive color . When lesions are wet, they take on a silvery color that gives the disease its name. Symptoms frequently are found on or near the tuber's stem end. May be confused with black dot.


","

1) The use of pathogen-free seed is extremely important.

2) Harvest tubers soon after they mature.

3) Dry tubers with nonhumidified air when they enter storage.

","Symptom severity depends on when plants are infected. Plants infected young may be severely stunted with irregular leaf shapes, necrotic young leaves, and an unthrifty appearance. Plants infected when older may show stunting but will have leaves that develop bronze or purplish irregular markings on the leaflets' upper sides. Markings may include flecking or ringspots. Leaf distortion, leaf yellowing, dark purple stem streaks, tip dieback, or wilt also may occur. Severely affected plants may have severe defoliation that resembles late blight.


","

1) Use certified seed potatoes.

2) Do not plant next to greenhouses in which herbaceous ornamentals are grown.

3) Rogue out infected plants.

4) Plant on UV-reflective mulch.

","None, once plants are infected. However, greenhouse operations should control the thrips vector to prevent disease spread. Thrips control is more difficult in field situations.

Potato ,(Solanum tuberosum)-Translucent End (Jelly End Rot),"This physiological condition is caused by high temperatures and/or moisture stress during tuber development. Also known as sugar end or jelly end.


","Affected tubers usually are pointed on the stem end, although bud ends also have been observed with translucent end. Tuber flesh from the affected area is translucent or glassy, devoid of starch, and usually high in reducing sugars. Tubers usually break down in storage or, if processed, produce dark fry products due to elevated sugar levels.

1) It is very important to manage soil moisture to minimize water stress during development. Using sprinklers and soil water monitoring equipment facilitates irrigation management.

2) Some cultivars (Lemhi, Nooksack) are less susceptible.

3) Plant in moderate soil types; avoid planting in heavier clay soils.

Potato ,(Solanum tuberosum)-Verticillium Wilt (Potato Early Dying),"A fungus, Verticillium dahliae, which survives in soil or in infected plant parts. It infects through roots and invades the plant's water-conducting tissues, ultimately causing a wilt issue. Disease severity is proportionate to the inoculum density of the fungus in the soil. The cultivars BelRus, Shepody, Russet Norkotah, and Superior are a few of many susceptible cultivars. The cultivar Russet Burbank is considered moderately resistant. The cultivar Ranger Russet is more resistant but yield loss still occurs even in this cultivar when grown full season. An interaction with this disease and lesion nematodes (Pratylenchus penetrans) can cause further damage. A number of other disease organisms are involved with potato early dying, including black dot and bacterial soft rot, but Verticillium is the most important component.


","Vines prematurely yellow and die. Early symptoms are characterized by unilateral leaf yellowing. Later, wilted and/or dead plants stand upright. In cross-section, particularly at or below the soil line, damage plants exhibit a darkened vascular system. This disease can greatly reduce yield from the onset of disease symptoms.


","

1) Rotate with weed- and volunteer-free alfalfa or cereals.

2) Optimum rates of nitrogen fertilizer reduce symptoms' severity.

3) Irrigation management early in the growing season (prior to tuber initiation) can help reduce disease severity. Keep soil water availability from 75% to 100%.

4) Use resistant cultivars such as Century Russet, Ranger Russet, or Targhee.

5) Green manure treatments of sudangrass or corn may help suppress disease.

","Soil fumigation gives economic control or suppression. Some labels call the disease ""early maturity disease."" Carefully read labels concerning new rules related to the use of buffer zones.
For control of Verticillium wilt and Columbia root-knot nematode (Meloidogyne chitwoodi), or Verticillium wilt and stubby-root nematode (Paratrichodurus spp.) as a vector of tobacco rattle virus (causal agent of corky ringspot disease), use metam sodium or metam potassium in combination with Telone II. See label for details.


1) Telone C-17 at 24 to 27.5 gal/A is registered for white potatoes. 5-day reentry. .

2) Apply a minimum of 38 (up to 75) gal/A of metam sodium 42% (Sectagon, Vapam HL, etc.) through sprinkler irrigation systems in sufficient water to penetrate to the desired treatment depth. Meter continuously into the irrigation system throughout the entire application period. Soil temperature should be in the range of 40°F to 90°F (lower is better to reduce volatilization of product). Soil moisture immediately prior to treatment must be 50% to 80% of field capacity down to the 24-inch level. Soil condition must facilitate even water penetration without runoff. Generally target treatment down to about 10 inches, the level of soil tillage, and do not work soil lower than the point of treatment following fumigation. Fall fumigation is likely the best fit for PNW uses.

3) Metam sodium can also be injected into soil using shanks, blades, fertilizer wheels, plows, etc. Follow immediately with a roller/packer to smooth and compact the soil surface to help prevent escape of fumigant. See specimen label for specific uses, rates and application methods. For optimum control of , injectors should be placed 4 to 6 inches below the soil surface and 5 to 6 inches apart. If nematodes are targeted, an additional injection at 12 inches (and perhaps an additional 18 inches) is necessary. Metam sodium may also be applied at the rate of 50 to 75 gal/A using a Noble Plow Blade set to 12 to 14 inches deep with spray nozzles spaced every 6 inches apart to give uniform coverage, plus a surface application using a disk to immediately incorporate the surface application. Reduced rates of metam sodium can be used when used in combination with Telone II. See label for details. 48-hr reentry. .

4) Metam potassium (54%) can be used in a similar fashion to metam sodium at rates of 30 to 60 gal/A. .

Potato ,(Solanum tuberosum)-White Mold (Sclerotinia Stem Rot),"A fungus, Sclerotinia sclerotiorum, that overwinters in soil as hard black sclerotia. Sclerotia germinate in spring and produce small, inverted, mushroom-like structures called apothecia that shoot spores into potato foliage. Spores produced in the potato field are more important for infection then those from outside the field. Petals on flowering potato plants are especially susceptible and important in the disease cycle. Petals fall and naturally become associated with stems. Infected petals are an initial source of nutrient for the fungus, which then infects the stems. Spores can also infected the stem directly. Sclerotia also can germinate directly and infect the plant. Though widespread, and at times appearing to be quite damaging, due to the easily seen damage in the field, the effect of yield is likely marginal in most fields.


","First, vines in the field rapidly wilt and die due to the girdling canker on the stem. The infected area can become covered with white mycelium. The stem becomes a light brown to white and brittle after infection.  Sclerotia commonly are inside these dried stems. At times, small inverted trumpet-shape structures called apothecia can be found under the vine cover after row closure, but because of their size, these are difficult to see.

Potato ,(Solanum tuberosum)-Witches' Broom,"A phytoplasma transmitted by several species of leafhopper and within potato seed pieces.


","Plants from an infected seed piece have multiple and highly branched stems. Leaves are rolled up and have yellow margins. Plants are dwarfed in the field. Stolons are elongated and set many small tubers, giving the effect of a chain of beads. Tubers usually are numerous but no larger than a walnut. Buds on tubers break and give rise to new stems or leafy growths. When a leafhopper transmits the virus, the plant produces many tightly spaced branches whose rolled-up leaves have chlorotic margins. Tubers formed after transmission are small, and buds break as above.

Potato ,(Solanum tuberosum)-Zebra Chip,"A phloem-limited bacterium, 'Candidatus Liberibacter solanacearum,' which is transmitted by the potato psyllid (Bactericera cockerelli), and probably in seed tubers. Originally a problem in Mexico by 1994, it was eventually reported in Texas and has since been reported around the United States, including in the PNW during 2011. Optimum temperature for disease development is 80°F to 90°F but transmission can occur at temperatures as cool as 54°F. In addition to potato, other cultivated (tomato and pepper) and wild solanaceous species are host to this pathogen. Zebra chip symptoms closely resemble potato purple-top, a phytoplasma caused disease, and psyllid yellows, a symptom resulting from feeding by the potato psyllid. While the vector of this disease is commonly found arriving in the PNW by mid to late season, apparently these insects do not always carry the bacterium. It is unknown at this time if this disease will be found yearly in the region in the future. The importance of seed as a source of this bacterium is not fully known at this time.


","Affected plants exhibit stunting, chlorosis or purplish coloration of leaves, leaf curling or scorching, aerial tuber formation, swollen internodes, and ""bushy"" plants due to axial bud elongation. Plants often die prematurely following infection. This disease can be confused with purple top or psyllid yellows.
In tubers dark stripes of necrotic tissue form, beginning on the stem end, especially in and around vascular tissue, and are very prominent when affected tubers are used for making chips or fries. A dark and sunken stolon attachment may be evident on some tubers. Steam-peeled tubers of 'Russet Burbank', 'Ranger Russet', and 'Umatilla Russet' appear darker compared to healthy tubers.


","

1) Plant certified seed.

2) Kill volunteer solanaceous around potato fields.

","Zebra chip cannot be controlled directly in potato but growers can indirectly control this disease by controlling the vector, the potato psyllid. For materials, rates, and procedures, consult the PNW Insect Management Handbook.

The fungus can be spread by infested equipment or windborne or waterborne movement of infested soil. Fusarium also produces spores, which can be moved with air currents or water.


","Wilting becomes evident as coneflowers begin flowering; portions of the shoot or the entire plant can die. Affected individual plants were observed in the earlier part of flowering, as the season progressed, large clusters of dead and dying plants were found.

Primrose ,(Primula spp.)-Bacterial Leaf Spot,"The bacterium Pseudomonas syringae pv. primulae can be a problem in cool, wet springs in the landscape. Has also been found as a greenhouse problem by the OSU Plant Clinic. Two common genetic traits increase the bacteria's ability to cause disease. Most produce a powerful plant toxin, syringomycin, which destroys plant tissues as bacteria multiply in a wound. Bacteria also produce a protein that acts as an ice nucleus, increasing frost wounds that bacteria easily colonize and expand.


","Spots are small and water-soaked at first with a yellowish center. Later spots are irregular, circular and surrounded by a yellowish halo. Spots may coalesce and kill large areas of the leaf. Symptoms may be seen more on older leaves.

It is found everywhere plants are grown and has a wide host range. Flower petals are most susceptible at any stage of development.
This fungus has been shown to be seedborne. Seed treatment did not prevent some plants from being colonized even when grown under sterile conditions. The fungus may grow systemically in the plant without producing symptoms until flowering and/or senescence.


","Leaves rot, especially those near the soil surface. Fading flowers and rotted leaves develop a gray fungal growth.


","

1) Remove all dead and dying plant parts (particularly blossoms) on and around plants and take them out of the greenhouse. Many growers use closed containers to minimize the amount of conidia.

2) Maintain a relatively dry greenhouse environment by keeping humidity below 90%, increasing spacing between plants for good air circulation, and taking care not to splash water on foliage during watering. Heating the greenhouse at night or venting around sunset may be necessary.

3) Spacing plants also allows better light penetration, reducing senescence of the lower leaves and thus helping reduce the amount of highly susceptible plant tissue.

4) Place fans in greenhouse for better air circulation.

5) Seed treatment has not been investigated and is not recommended but cleaning seed of all plant debris may be useful.

Field-budded rootstocks or budding 3 feet above the root crown also helped reduce the incidence of bacterial canker on french prunes.


","The most conspicuous symptoms are cankers, gum exudation, and dieback of girdled branches. Dead buds and leaf spots also can occur. In most cases, heavy gumming is associated with bacterial canker formation on branches and twigs. Gumming occurs at the cankers' margins. Other problems can lead to gumming {see Cherry (Prunus spp. - Gumming)}.
Cankers caused by the bacteria may be on the trunk, limbs, and twigs. Typical cankers are much longer than broad, but a canker may girdle the infected limb or trunk. The cambium at the canker will be discolored and necrotic. Use a pocket knife to reveal this discolored tissue. Cankers develop in winter and early spring. As the tree begins growth in spring, the bacteria population declines and a callus layer forms around the canker's edge. During spring and summer, girdled and nearly girdled limbs may leaf out. Normally, leaves turn yellow, then the limbs usually die. In some instances, these symptoms may not appear until late summer when the leaves' water requirement is high.
Dead bud ""disease"" is first noted as dying buds on spurs in spring. Infected buds usually start to die in February. As the disease progresses, both leaf and flower become infected. Dead bud usually starts in lower limbs and moves up the tree and to adjacent trees in successive years. Often, trees in the lower orchard, where air drainage is poor, are the first to be infected. If all buds on a spur are killed, the spur will die back next season. Cankers very seldom form, but the diseased buds may produce a slight gumming. Repeated death of buds may result in misshaped growth and sometimes fasciation. In severe cases, 90% or more of buds on a tree may be killed.
Leaf and fruit spots are not common and are not numerous if they develop. Spots on leaves are at first water soaked, then become dry and brown. Spots on fruit are dark to black and depressed or pitted.


","Bacterial canker is best managed through the use of many different tactics.

1) Plant resistant cultivars and/or rootstocks.

2) Do not interplant new trees with old trees, which are a major source of the bacteria.

3) Locate orchard in an area less likely to be affected by frost. If planting in the spring, plant orchards after date that frost is likely to have occurred. Prevent winter injury by painting trunks white and avoiding late season fertility.

4) Test soil for ring nematodes before planting. Also test for pH and other physical characteristics that can be corrected prior to planting.

5) Provide optimal soil conditions including attention to pH and nutrition. Annually monitor for adequate nutrient levels such as nitrogen. Keep irrigation off above ground parts for the first few years.

6) Control weeds.

7) Delay dormant pruning until January or February. Summer pruning is even better and should be after harvest, when weather is dry. Make heading cuts after planting only during dry weather when rain will not occur for at least a week after pruning. Make heading cuts close to a lateral bud.

8) Completely remove infected trees or branches girdled and killed by cankers. Do not allow trees to regrow from roots or trunks left after a major trunk canker has been removed.

9) In summer, small cankers may be cut out using the following method. Cut away bark above and around the edges of the infected area. Use sharp tools, and leave wound margins smooth and neat. Wounds should be left uncovered to dry out during the summer. Try not to have sprinkler irrigation soak the wounds. Sterilize all pruning tools between cuts with an appropriate disinfestant.

","Copper-based products have not worked well under conditions favorable for disease development. Bacteria re-sistant to copper products have been detected throughout our stone fruit growing regions, which compromises chemical control tactics. Heavy use of copper products is not recommended as concentrations in the soil can build up to toxic levels after several decades of use.
Focus on cultural control tactics first and supplement with chemical control. Traditional recommendations encourage the first spray to occur in October before fall rains followed by another application in early January. Growers should consider adjusting the timing of sprays to coincide with leaf fall. Thorough coverage is needed. Protecting heading cuts made after planting a new orchard is also important. Protect both orchard and nursery trees (sweet cherry, prune, and plum). Some growers use low rates of copper-based products during bud break to reduce symptoms of dead bud.


Efficacy of these products has not been extensively tested in the PNW. Frequent use (every few days) is on the label, which still may not be effective during conditions favorable for bacterial growth and infection.

Prune and Plum ,(Prunus spp.)-Russeting,"Rain during full bloom and for 1 week after (russet scab); high wind for several days within 3 weeks of full bloom (wind scab); or applications of fixed copper have been associated with a russeting of French prunes. Keeping blossoms wet with water for several days at full bloom and petal fall has induced russet scab. No fungal or other microorganisms have been associated with the problem even though fungicides can control the problem. However, a yeast has been associated with russet of pome fruit.
Russeted areas have a thin cuticle, lack epicuticular wax, and have abnormal stomata. Wind scab can occur when immature fruits rub against other fruit, leaves, or stems during strong winds. Fungal rots, such as Diaporthe cinerascens (formerly Phomopsis cinerascens), also may be more a problem at the margin of scabby areas Thrips damage also can result in similar russeting of all stone fruits.


","Russet scab starts on immature fruit as shiny areas 3 to 4 weeks after full bloom. Four weeks later, these areas become distinct and form an irregular, lacy band generally on the lower half of the fruit. This area becomes brown and rough just before harvest. Scabby areas can remain even after fruit are dried.
Wind scab is similar but generally runs along the axis of the fruit and occurs in the middle of the fruit. It also is a problem after fruit are dried. Similar russeting has been reported on Italian prunes in Oregon, and those affected fruit also are misshapen.


","Correct pruning for strong limbs will help with wind scab.

Prune and Plum ,(Prunus spp.)-Silver Leaf,,,,,
Prune and Plum ,(Prunus spp.)-Virus Diseases,"Many prune trees in Oregon are infected with one or more latent (symptomless) viruses, but we do not know how much they reduce growth and yield. OSU Plant Clinic has diagnosed several fruit and ornamental samples from Oregon with Prunus necrotic ringspot virus and Prune dwarf virus. It is not clear if Peach mosaic virus was confirmed but was suspected in several plum and prune samples that had mosaic symptoms on the leaves. This could be due to other virus or combinations of viruses in the tree.
Plum Pox is a serious disease that has not been found in the PNW but would have major economic impact if it spreads here.
A strain of Tomato ringspot virus causes a girdling and stem pitting at the graft union of infected trees. Tomato ringspot virus is spread by Xiphinema americanum and X. rivesi, nematodes. The virus may enter the orchard on infected nursery trees.


","Symptom expression varies considerably among cultivars and among strains of the same virus. Thus the top (scion) may be symptomless and the rootstock very sensitive. All other combinations also have been reported; i.e., rootstock symptomless, scion very susceptible, both scion and rootstock susceptible, and both symptomless. When a virus enters the symptomless portion, reaction may be severe when it reaches the sensitive portion. This may kill cells at the graft union and result in virus-induced incompatibility with symptoms of decline, collapse, or tree breakage.
Prunus stem pitting-Conspicuous sunken areas form on trunks of infected trees. Enlarged areas of the trunks become flattened and ridged. Pitting and grooving develops in the woody cylinder. Initial pitting in naturally infected orchard trees always is at or below ground level and extends for a short distance into the lower trunk and roots. The extent and severity of pitting, cambial and bark necrosis, enlargement of the trunk, and disorganization of xylem tissue within the woody cylinder increases with time.
Stanley prune constriction-Initial symptoms are weak growth of the terminals and yellowing and upward rolling of the foliage. Affected trees are weakly anchored in the soil. A pronounced overgrowth of the scion (""inverted shoulder"") can be seen at the scion-rootstock union, while the rootstock is markedly reduced in diameter. The overgrown scion tissues are cheese-like in consistency. Numerous, abnormally large lenticels appear in the scion bark immediately above the union, below which the bark of the rootstock is necrotic in large areas or completely dead. Symptoms may develop at any time after a Stanley tree is propagated until at least the tenth year of growth. Incipient constriction may be visible in 1-year-old nursery trees, but more commonly the disorder is not evident until 1 to 5 years after the tree is planted in the orchard. Affected trees usually die within 1 to 2 years after foliage symptoms become evident.
Plum Pox-Leaf symptoms appear as pale or yellowish-green rings, spots, or leaf mottling. Plum fruit are deformed and show engraved rings, irregular lines, and poxes on the surface. Damaged fruit may drop prematurely. Bark splitting and cankers on the shoot that are brittle and degraded have also been reported. If you suspect this disease, get samples to the ODA as soon as possible.

Prunus laurocerasus,Leaf Spots and Shothole,"Shothole symptoms are commonly observed on Prunus spp. and can be caused by a variety of factors. Development of the shothole symptom is in response to mechanical, chemical, or pathogen injury. There is the formation of meristematic tissue around the injury that becomes lignified or suberized to form a physical and biochemical barrier that, in the case of pathogens, limits the colonization of healthy tissue. The formation of an abscission layer may be dependent on temperature. In almond leaves, an abscission layer formed at 72°F but not at 59°F.
The bacteria Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae and Xanthomonas arbicola pv. pruni as well as several fungi including Cercospora sp., Blumeriella sp., and Thyrostroma carpophilum (Coryneum blight) can cause leaf spots and shothole on cherry laurel (English laurel, Otto Luyken, or 'Zabeliana'). Two other fungi have been reported from Germany in association with shothole symptoms. Copper spray injury and boron toxicity can also cause leaf spotting and shothole. When symptoms are advanced, it is not possible to identify the cause specifically. Some virus infections (such as Prunus necrotic ringspot virus) can cause a shothole symptom in fruiting cherries but this has not been reported for cherry laurels.
Cherry laurels (English laurel, Otto Luyken, or 'Zabeliana'), P. laurocerasus and sometimes other Prunus spp. including cherry and plum, commonly show shothole symptoms resulting from only cultural or environmental stress. Both container- and field-grown laurel can develop symptoms. Some growers have observed that plants are more susceptible to symptom development when grown in containers. Portuguese cherry laurel (Prunus lusitanica) is nearly resistant.


","Necrotic leaf spots with circular to irregular margins. Bacterial spots are brown surrounded by a reddish border with a yellow halo. Abscission layers develop around necrotic leaf spots causing the injured tissue to drop away, leaving holes and tattered areas in the leaf (as if someone fired a shotgun at the leaf-thus the name shothole). After tissues drop, most often it is difficult to determine specifically what caused the initial injury. Observations of early symptom development, signs, and symptoms on other areas of the plant may help make an accurate diagnosis.


","No management practices have been shown to help reduce physiological shothole. For disease-induced shothole, try the following.

1) Avoid overhead irrigation or apply such that plants are not wet for extended periods of time.

2) Remove and destroy fallen leaves.

3) Do not plant near other flowering or fruiting  spp.

4) One nursery reported good success with first growing in the field and then potting plants the year before sale rather than starting with containers.

5) The cultivar Chestnut Hill is reported to have superior resistance to shothole when compared with Otto Luyken.

Quince,Leaf Spot,"Diplocarpon mespili formerly Fabraea maculata (asexual: Entomosporium mespili), a fungus. Common in western Oregon and Washington on Cydonia sp. Other names include Fabraea leaf blight spot.  Host range is wide including Asian pear, hawthorn, pear, photinia and serviceberry. Quince, some Asian pears and Asian hybrids are particularly susceptible, such as the Chinese cultivar Ya Li, while others are more resistant. Many ornamental pears, Pyrus calleryana, also get leaf spot.
The fungus overwinters in diseased leaves and shoots. Cool, wet weather favors disease development in the spring. Spores are disseminated by splashing water and need 8 to 12 hours of leaf wetness to infect leaves. Susceptibility does not seem to be reduced with leaf maturity.


","Reddish-purple spots develop on infected leaves. Centers of the spots become tan, and fungal sporulation (in acervuli) may be obvious in the center. Spots may also have a reddish halo.

Radicchio ,(Cichorium intybus)-Sclerotinia Cottony Rot,"Sclerotinia sclerotiorum is a fungus that overwinters as small black structures (sclerotia). Sclerotia may survive several years. After a moisture-conditioning period of at least 70 days, they produce a small, stalked, cup-shaped fruiting structure (apothecium), which releases spores into the air. Spores may infect senescent tissue such as blossoms and leaves or may germinate and colonize plant debris. After colonizing, the fungus can invade any part of a healthy plant with which it comes in contact. Moist conditions within the plant canopy favor infection, as do rain, dew, and/or irrigation practices that keep foliage wet for long periods.
Other host plants include bean, carrots, pea, lettuce, potato, green pepper, cucurbits, parsnip, radish, other crucifers including canola, flower seed crops, and sunflower. Dandelion (Taraxacum officinale) is a very susceptible weed host.


","The disease is mainly on aboveground parts, producing a cottony white fungal growth. As leaves decay, small dark bodies appear in the fungal growth. Finally, the fungal growth is replaced by numerous hardened sclerotia that gradually change from white to black.
On seed crops, stem attacks cause severe losses. Diseased tissues eventually bleach white, giving the disease its name ""white blight."" Sclerotia that are black on the surface and white inside, associated with this bleached tissue, are diagnostic.

Radicchio ,(Cichorium intybus)-Tip Burn,"This is a physiological disorder. High fertility and high temperatures aggravate the disorder. Research indicates it is caused by an imbalance of calcium. Water stress followed by a period of excessive growth and dry soil conditions favors development of tip burn.

","No completely effective controls are known.

1) Soil samples should show adequate base saturation and adequate levels of calcium.

2) Use adequate irrigation to avoid water stress conditions that would interfere with calcium movement to inner leaves.

Cruciferous weeds common in the Pacific Northwest can be host to black leg, including birdsrape mustard (Brassica rapa), black mustard (B. nigra), western yellow cress or curvepod yellowcress (Rorippa curvisiliqua), tansymustard (Descurainia pinnata), hedge mustard (Sisymbrium officinale), tumble mustard (S. altissimum), small tumbleweed mustard (S. loeselii), pennycress (Thlaspi arvense), mouseear cress (Arabidopsis thaliana), annual wallrocket (Diplotaxis muralis), perennial wallrocket (D. tenuifolia), and wild radish (Raphanus raphanistrum). The fungus survives on living plants as pycnidia, which produce water-splashed pycnidiospores, or with plant debris as pycnidia and/or pseudothecia. Pseudothecia release ascospores that may be windborne long distances, at least several miles and perhaps further on storm fronts. The fungus survives in association with infected plant residues until the plant debris decomposes (up to 4 years). In fall-sown crops or winter weeds, new pseudothecia can form on dead portions of infected plants prior to plant death or harvest and continue forming on the infected plant residues remaining on the soil surface after harvest. In spring-sown crops, pseudothecia do not form until after harvest, and their production on residues atop the soil typically starts the following fall after a couple of wet periods. When residues are on the soil surface, ascospores are released from the pseudothecia following wet or humid conditions and when mean temperatures are between 46°F and 59°F. Conditions conducive for ascospore production and release commonly occur during the fall, winter, and springtime throughout the Pacific Northwest. Trap plants deployed weekly in multiple sites around the Willamette Valley in western Oregon beginning in October 2014 and 2015, showed that ascospore infections began around mid-October. During 2015-2016, ascospore infections of trap plants occurred from mid-October into May with severe disease pressure during February and March. Wounding, insect injury, or herbicide injury can result in greater disease severity.
Two types of pycnidia (which produce asexual spores known as pycnidiospores) can be found; one on infected, live plants (thinner-walled pycnidium with a neck) and the other on crop residues (thicker-walled pycnidium with a narrow ostiole). Pycnidiospores are dispersed by splashing rain or irrigation water, so pycnidiospore movement is limited to relatively short distances, but pycnidiospores can add to the overall incidence and severity of disease build-up within a field. Workers or equipment moving through infected plantings during wet conditions can spread disease.
Black leg can also move with infected seed, Leptosphaeria can survive for years in association with seed. But if, as a general practice, seed lots used for planting are Leptosphaeria-free then the spread of regional epidemics is thought to arise from infected plant debris.  Even low levels of seed infection, when coupled with weather favorable for disease, can lead to severe losses, including stand die-out within a field. The Oregon Department of Agriculture requires that all crucifer seed, even half ounce or smaller packets, that is to be planted in Oregon must be accompanied by an official test showing that the untreated seed is free from black leg (Leptosphaeria species).
This disease can reduce vegetable, cover crop, and seed yields. After a disease outbreak in a larger geographic area, the threat of seed yield loss in fall-sown crops is much greater due to the abundance of affected crop residues on the soil surface, especially if field-wide epidemics occurred in no-till production. Widespread leaf spot and subsequent black leg stem cankers can result from unprotected plants being exposed to ascospores released from infected crop residues. Replanting or allowing volunteers to grow in a field after a black leg outbreak can result in high numbers of infected seedlings by fall in western Oregon or Washington Brassica or radish seed fields, perpetuating disease. Planting adjacent to a previously-infected field can also result in a high disease incidence (40 to 60%) in the new planting by December, while planting within a few miles of an infected residue site can result in generalized infections across new fields (1 to 5%). Researchers at OSU have observed uncontrolled black leg infections in fall-planted Brassica seed fields in western Oregon to increase from a low disease incidence (1 to 5%) to high (40 to 90% of the stand infected) in a 6-week period. Infections of fall-planted vegetable or seed fields can lead to stand losses through winter into the spring.


","Generalized leaf spots, becoming numerous across the field, have been observed in fall-planted crops after initial windblown spore (ascospore) infections. Pale, irregular spots develop on cotyledons, leaves, stems or petioles, later becoming somewhat circular to oval, ashy-gray colored with scattered tiny, black pycnidia. Sometimes the center of lesions will fall out, especially after heavy rain-fall, but a narrow, ashy-gray band with pycnidia usually remains. Stem cankers that develop after the fungus grows systemically down the plant from initial leaf spots are elongated with purple-black borders, and may girdle the stem or extend below the soil surface, causing a black rot of the storage root as well as a brown-to-gray to black-colored rot inside affected stems. Vascular tissues turn black in color prior to development of external black leg symptoms. Damping-off can occur if plants are infected at the seedling stage, usually through the use of infected seeds. Plants produced from infected seeds that survive the seedling stage are stunted and often develop a rot of the stem at or just below the soil line, which moves upwards and can cause plant death.
In seed crops, leaf spots may appear on over-wintered plants at initially low levels but increase as pycnidiospores spread the leaf spot. As seed plants mature, they may fall sideways from lack of root anchorage or stem cankers may cause the top of the plant to fall over. Symptoms on seed pods are rare and inconspicuous. Black leg stem cankers in seed crops may be invaded by secondary pathogens, masking black leg symptoms on the stems of affected plants.


","

1) Plant only seed certified by official testing be free of .

2) Avoid planting in or adjacent to a site where disease has occurred within the last 3 to 4 years; plantings within a quarter of a mile of a field containing black leg-infected crucifer residues are at high risk for developing black leg.

3) Delay spring plantings until the weather is drier to avoid periods of ascospore release.

4) Bury residues after harvest by deep plowing if possible, or remove plant debris. Multiple flailings (three) followed by a shallow incorporation may be sufficient depending on amount and size of plant debris as well as environmental conditions.

5) Control susceptible weeds and control volunteer crucifers.

6) Hot water seed treatment for 15 min. in water at 122°F (50°C).

7) For organic production, removal of affected leaves shortly after leaf spots develop can reduce secondary spread within a planting as well as the incidence of stem cankers.

","Seed treatment and a foliar fungicide program will be essential if growing seed fields in any region where black leg epidemics have occurred across a larger geographic area. Infected seed can occur in seed lots, certified to be free of black leg, at levels below the detection threshold by seed testing, and chemical or hot water seed treatments will aid in controlling disease introduction by infected seed.

Radish ,(Raphanus sativus)-Black Root,"Aphanomyces raphani, a fungus-like organism. The disease has been so severe in northwestern Oregon fields that the crop has been plowed under. The cultivar White Icicle is very susceptible. The fungus attacks primarily radish but also can infect many other crucifers.


","Symptoms appear around side roots, or at growth cracks, or at wounds on the upper root. These areas are discolored a brown to bluish black. As the disease progresses, root growth there ceases, resulting in a blackened, constricted area that sometimes girdles the entire root. This black discoloration extends inward in radial streaks.


","

1) Plant in a well-drained area and avoid overwatering.

2) Use a 3 to 4 year crop rotation.

3) Variety 'White Spike' is less susceptible than 'White Icicle', and 'Red Prince' has more resistance than most other red globe types. 'Fuego' and 'Belle Glade' also are resistant.

Radish ,(Raphanus sativus)-Light Leaf Spot,"The fungus, Cylindrosporium concentricum (sexual stage: Pyrenopeziza brassicae) has been found in Oregon on canola, turnip, volunteer or wild radish, wild mustard, volunteer black mustard, vegetable Brassica seed fields, and Brassica species used as cover crops since 2014. The disease was found during 2016 in the Skagit Valley of western Washington on Brassica cover crops and wild mustard. All Brassicas grown in the Pacific Northwest are probably susceptible but the specific host range within the cruciferous crops is unknown at this time. Oilseed rape and cauliflower are reported to be more susceptible than Brussels sprouts or kale, but there is a range of susceptibility within each crop species. The pathogen has been a problem on oilseed rape in various parts of the world with seed losses estimated at 22% when outbreaks have occurred in the United Kingdom. This disease hasn't been previously reported in North America though an infected mustard field was found in western Oregon during 1998. Oilseed rape is very susceptible and losses results from stand die-out, reduced pod numbers, premature pod ripening, or an overall growth reduction with less severe infections. Crucifers grown as vegetables in other areas of the globe, where this disease has been reported, suffer blemish defects by relatively mild infections, causing a decrease in quality but not of yield quantity. Trichloroacetic acid-based herbicides may increase plant susceptibility by affecting the waxy layer of leaves.
Ascospores develop from apothecia on infected plant residues and can be wind-dispersed relatively long distances after a wetting period, infecting susceptible plants. Asexual spores (conidia) develop but spread relatively short distances by rain or splashing water, potentially causing pod infections during the following spring. Seed can be infected or casually infested with the asexual stage yet seed transmission occurs at very low rates due to rapid die-out of the pathogen on seed. Still, epidemics can be initiated by seedborne inoculum or from neighboring fields of infected plants or residues, or from infected volunteers. Wet conditions and cool temperatures (around 60°F is optimum) promote disease development. Fall-infected plants may remain symptomless through the winter season till the following spring. Light leaf spot reappeared during late February in western Oregon, but ascospores probably began infecting during the previous October and November, possibly throughout the winter.


","This fungus can attack leaves, stems and pods. Flecking may be observed on cotyledons while leaf infections start as discolored patches that develop into irregular brown lesions with cracked centers, sometimes turning black. Veins surrounding young lesions often take on an olive-brown hue and may exhibit deformities. Leaf lesions can coalesce, causing death of leaves. When leaves are infected young, distortion can develop. Stem lesions are superficial, elongated brownish streaks with grayish-black margins and can be mistaken for black leg, except decay does not affect the stem pith. Flower infections may cause abortion. Pods infected early appear distorted while pods infected later result in relatively healthy looking pods but will have white spore masses. Seedlings can be killed or plants may be stunted.


","

1) Rotate out of crucifers for 3 years.

2) Avoid planting adjacent to a field infected the previous season.

3) Control susceptible weeds and volunteer crucifers.

4) Remove plant debris or bury by deep-plowing, important for preventing sexual recombinants from developing with new virulence or fungicide resistance. Flailing followed by a shallow incorporation may be sufficient depending on amount and size of plant debris as well as environmental conditions.

Radish ,(Raphanus sativus)-Powdery Mildew,"The fungus, Erysiphe cruciferarum (syn. E. polygoni), can infect most crucifer crops and cruciferous weeds, but strains exist that have specificity and will infected only a subset of the crucifers. Stressed plants will be more susceptible to disease. The fungus survives on infected hosts or as chasmothecia (formerly cleistothecia), sexually-produced survival structures on infected crop debris. Disease is promoted under cool conditions of low rainfall and reduced relative humidity.


","Small, discrete white patches develop on both leaf surfaces. Later, patches coalesce until a powdery mass of white mycelium and spores cover the entire leaf. Leaves later become yellow, brown and prematurely defoliate.


","

1) Plant resistant varieties if available.

2) Avoid over-application of nitrogen fertilizers; use an optimum, balance fertility regime.

3) Avoid drought stress.

4) Avoid continuous cropping of susceptible crucifers.

5) Practice a 3-year rotation with nonsusceptible crops and manage crucifer weeds.

","Foliar fungicide applications can help when under severe disease pressure.


1) Strobilurin fungicides (Group 11) are labeled for use. Do not make more than two (2) applications of any Group 11 fungicide per season.

1.1) Cabrio EG at 12 to 16 oz/A on 7- to 14-day intervals. Preharvest interval is 0 days. 12-hr reentry.
1.2) Quadris Flowable at 6 to 15.5 fl oz/A applied prior to disease development. Preharvest interval is 0 days. 4-hr reentry.
2) Sulfur formulations are registered for radish (Microthiol Disperss , etc.). Sulfur is fungitoxic in its vapor phase and, therefore, is effective only when air temperatures promote volatilization. Sulfur volatilizes above 65°F but becomes phytotoxic above 95°F. Using it above 85°F is not recommended. Although sulfur reduces sporulation of established infections, it is primarily a protectant and must be applied before infection. Begin applying when weather conditions are appropriate and continue at weekly intervals. See label for details on rates and reentry intervals.   Frequent sulfur applications can negatively affect beneficial insects.

Radish ,(Raphanus sativus)-White Leaf Spot and Gray Stem,"The fungus, Pseudocercosporella capsellae (sexual stage: Mycosphaerella capsellae), has been observed in various Brassica and radish vegetable and seed crops in Oregon. It has been reported in oilseed rape in the United Kingdom and Canada. Pod losses of 15% have been reported in Europe. Turnip, Chinese cabbage, mustards and oilseed rape are thought to be more susceptible than cabbage, cauliflower, broccoli and other vegetable Brassica species. Horseradish and radish are susceptible to white leaf spot as well as weedy types such as wild radish, wild mustard, and shepherd's purse.
Ascospores develop on infected Brassica or Raphanus residues during the autumn and possibly winter or spring months; these ascospores are wind-dispersed relatively long distances following rain or dew events. After a successful infection, asexual spores (conidia) subsequently develop in the leaf spots and are spread relatively short distances by rain or splashing water, causing secondary spread, including pod and seed infections. Seed transmission has not been reported to play a major role in disease outbreaks; infected crop residues are usually necessary for large-scale outbreaks, but seed transmission can lead to introduction of disease into new areas. Temperatures of 50°F to 60°F with moist conditions (rain, dew, or irrigation) promote disease development.


","This fungus can attack leaves, stems and pods. Tan, irregular or roundish spots develop on leave, especially leaf tips and edges, later becoming ashy-gray to white with a brownish margin and sometimes a yellowish halo. White conidia can be observed on the underside of leaf spots. Leaf spots will become dark brown as leaves senesce, due to the initiation of the sexual stage. The center of older lesions may fall out, resulting in a shot hole appearance. Lesions may coalesce when disease is severe, resulting in defoliation. Stem lesions are elongated and first brown, turning ashy-gray to white with a brownish margin and numerous tiny dark specks due to the formation of the sexual stage; there is a distinct boundary between diseased and healthy tissue on the stem. Gray stem lesions are superficial; the pith is not severely infected, helping to distinguish gray stem from black leg. Pod infections are at first small brown spots that expand and turn grayish-white with numerous tiny dark specks due to the formation of the sexual stage.

Radish ,(Raphanus sativus)-White Rust,"Albugo candida, a fungus-like microorganism, can cause disease on radish, rapeseed, and wild mustards. Crucifers in general are potential hosts, as well as spinach and horseradish. In the Pacific Northwest, white rust can be severe on radish seed crops. All round, red cultivars and some selections of 'Daikon' appear susceptible. The pathogen overwinters as oospores in stagheads (galls formed on infected seed heads) or plant debris as well as mycelium in infected hosts. Pieces of staghorns are often found as seed contaminants and can be the primary source of infection in a field. The oospores can germinate and infect young plants, leading to pustules on leaves. Sporangia are produced in pustules, can be moved by wind, rain, or insects, and can germinate, giving rise to zoospores. Zoospores are motile; they swim for a short distance and then invade the plant by germinating through the stomata. Sporangia require some drying in order to germinate but disease development is favored by moist conditions and temperatures between 50°F and 77°F. Dew, fog, or periods of extended rainfall and cool temperatures are ideal for zoospore activity. White rust is often associated with downy mildew.


","First symptoms may appear as small, light green spots, which later turn white and finally result in blister-like raised white pustules usually on the lower leaf surface. Pustules can develop on the upper or lower leaf surfaces or on stems and consist of masses of sporangia. Systemic infections can occur, causing the aboveground portion of young seedlings to be distorted and appear abnormally shaped. Infections of the flower parts may cause a bizarre outgrowth on the seed stalk. Seed pedicels may terminate and form staghorns without seeds developing. Seed yield and quality are severely reduced.

Rapeseed = Canola ,(Brassica napus and B. rapa = B. campestris)-Bacterial Black Rot (Bacterial Leaf Spot),"Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris is a bacterium that overwinters in plant refuse for up to 2 years and is carried internally and externally on seed. The bacterium infects other crucifer crops and weeds. It may be spread in the field by water (rain, irrigation), insects, equipment, and animals. When spread by water, bacteria enter water pores (hydathodes) at leaf margins or occasionally through insect or other mechanical injuries. From the leaf, the infection proceeds up and down the main stem and then becomes systemic. Disease development may stop in unfavorable weather only to resume when conditions are favorable. Optimum temperatures for development are 80°F to 86°F. Water in the form of dew, rain, or sprinkler irrigation is necessary for spread.

Veins in these areas become dark brown or black; when the leaf is held up to a strong light source, they show up as a black net. Vascular tissue of the main stem then becomes blackened. As the infection becomes systemic, symptoms (the same as those found from direct infection) may appear anywhere on the plant. Unilateral stunting of some leaves occurs. In infected seed, the first symptoms appear on cotyledons, which rapidly wilt and drop off; usually, however, the infection has reached the stem and proceeds up.

Rapeseed = Canola ,(Brassica napus and B. rapa = B. campestris)-Black Leg (Phoma Stem Canker),"Leptosphaeria maculans (syn. Plenodomus lingam, anamorph: Phoma lingam) is a fungus that can infect a range of cruciferous crops. Host plants include Brassica species (broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cabbage, collards, canola, kale, mizuna, mustards, oilseed rape, oilseed turnip rape, rutabaga, turnip, etc.), Sinapis (white and yellow mustard), and Raphanus (daikon and radish). Cruciferous weeds common in the Pacific Northwest can be host to black leg, including birdsrape mustard (Brassica rapa), black mustard (B. nigra), western yellow cress or curvepod yellowcress (Rorippa curvisiliqua), tansymustard (Descurainia pinnata), hedge mustard (Sisymbrium officinale), tumble mustard (S. altissimum), small tumbleweed mustard (S. loeselii), pennycress (Thlaspi arvense), mouseear cress (Arabidopsis thaliana), annual wallrocket (Diplotaxis muralis), perennial wallrocket (D. tenuifolia), and wild radish (Raphanus raphanistrum). The fungus survives on living plants as pycnidia, which produce water-splashed pycnidiospores, or with plant debris as pycnidia and/or pseudothecia. Pseudothecia release ascospores that may be wind windborne long distances, at least several miles and perhaps further on storm fronts. The fungus survives in association with infected plant residues until the plant debris decomposes (1 to 4 years); it can survive for years as mycelia in infected seed. Leaf spots on cotyledons or first true leaves can be a result of infested seed, but epidemics are thought to arise from infected plant debris if seed lots used for planting are Leptosphaeria-free. Spots on leaves, stems, or pods develop after ascospores infect, and then stem cankers develop after the fungus spreads via the vascular system from leaves to the stems. In fall-sown crops or winter weeds, new pseudothecia can form on infected plants prior to harvest and continue forming in the residues on the soil surface after harvest whereas on spring-sown crops, pseudothecia do not form until after harvest. When residues are on the soil surface, ascospores are released from the pseudothecia following wet or humid conditions and when mean temperatures are between 46°F and 59°F; which is common during the fall, winter, and spring in portions of the Pacific Northwest. Trap plants deployed weekly in multiple sites around the Willamette Valley in western Oregon beginning in the fall 2014 and 2015, showed that the first infections from ascospores occurred around mid-October. Timing of ascospore release is dependent on temperature and rainfall. During 2015-2016, ascospore infections of trap plants occurred from mid-October into May with severe disease pressure during February and March. Wounding, insect injury, or herbicide injury can result in greater disease severity.
Two types of pycnidia (which produce asexual spores known as pycnidiospores) can be found; one on infected, live plants (thinner-walled pycnidium with a neck) and the other on crop residues (thicker-walled pycnidium with a narrow ostiole). Pycnidiospores are dispersed by splashing rain or irrigation water, so pycnidiospore movement is limited to relatively short distances, but pycnidiospores can add to the overall incidence and severity of disease within a field. Disease also spreads by workers or equipment moving through infected plantings during wet conditions when pycnidia are present.
A weakly virulent strain is widespread in canola-producing regions across the world and a highly virulent strain has been found in canola fields in western Canada and the Midwestern region of the United States as well as the Pacific Northwest. This disease can reduce seed crop yields, and low levels of seed infection coupled with weather favorable for disease spread can lead to stand die-out in a field. After a disease outbreak in a larger geographic area, the threat of seed yield loss in fall-sown crops is much greater due to the abundance of affected crop residues on the soil surface, especially if field-wide outbreaks occurred in no-till production. Replanting or allowing volunteers to grow in a field site after a black leg epidemic can also result in high numbers of infected seedlings by fall in western Oregon or Washington Brassica seed fields, perpetuating disease. Widespread leaf spot and subsequent black leg stem cankers can result from unprotected plants being exposed to ascospores released from infected crop residues. Planting adjacent to a previously-infected field can result in a high disease incidence (40 to 60%) in the new planting by December, while planting within a few miles of an infected residue site can result in generalized infections across new fields (1 to 5%) by December. Researchers at OSU have observed uncontrolled black leg infections in fall-planted seed fields in western Oregon to increase from 1 to 5 % disease incidence up to 40 to 90% of the plants in a stand being infected within a 6-week period. Infections of fall-planted oilseed fields can lead to stand losses through winter into the spring.


","Damping-off may occur if plants are infected at the seedling stage due to infected seed. Plants affected after the seedling stage may be stunted. Generalized leaf spots, becoming numerous across the field, have been observed in fall-planted crops after initial windblown spore (ascospore) infections. Pale, irregular spots develop on cotyledons, leaves, stems or petioles, later becoming somewhat circular to oval, ashy-gray colored with scattered tiny, black pycnidia. Stem lesions that develop after the fungus moves systemically are elongated with purple borders, often near the soil line, and may girdle the stem as well as decay pith tissues, and extend below the soil surface, causing a brown-to-gray to black rot in the lower stem and roots. Stem lesion may be narrow (<1/16 inch) longitudinal dark streaks on canola until harvest. Brown-to-black rot can be found inside affected stems. Vascular tissues may turn black in color prior to external rot symptoms.
Leaf spots may appear on over-wintered leaves at initially low levels but increase as pycnidiospores spread the leaf spot to new growth in the spring. Symptoms on seed pods are rare and inconspicuous. Black leg stem cankers in seed crops may be invaded by Sclerotinia sclerotiorum, masking black leg symptoms on the stems of affected plants.

2) Avoid planting in or adjacent to a site where disease has occurred within the last 3 to 4 years; plantings within a quarter of a mile of a field containing black leg-infected crucifer residues are at high risk for developing black leg.

3) Delay planting in the spring until the weather is drier to avoid periods of ascospore release.

4) Bury residues after harvest by deep plowing if possible, or remove plant debris. Multiple flailings (up to three) followed by a shallow incorporation may be sufficient depending on amount and size of plant debris as well as environmental conditions.

5) Control susceptible weeds and control volunteer crucifers.

6) Hot water seed treatment for 25 to 30 min. in water at 122°F (50°C).

7) For organic production, removal of affected leaves shortly after leaf spots develop can reduce secondary spread within a planting as well as the incidence of stem cankers.

","Seed treatment and a foliar fungicide program will be essential if growing seed fields in any region where black leg epidemics have occurred across a larger geographic area. Infected seed can occur in seed lots, certified to be free of black leg, at levels below the detection threshold by seed testing, and chemical or hot water seed treatments will aid in controlling disease introduction by infected seed.

Rapeseed = Canola ,(Brassica napus and B. rapa = B. campestris)-Clubroot,"The disease is caused by Plasmodiophora brassicae, a fungus-like microorganism that can survive in soil 18 years or more after an infected crop. It can be spread through any means that moves soil: wind and water, footwear and equipment. Soils that are cool, wet (70% to 80% water-holding capacity) and acidic favor the pathogen.
Clubroot probably affects all species in the crucifer group, including wild mustard. There are races within the clubroot pathogen population; certain strains of clubroot vary in the range of cruciferous species affected. The microorganism that causes clubroot occurs worldwide and also infects plants in the rose, poppy, and grass families. However, these plants rarely show typical symptoms of the disease. Viable spores of Plasmodiophora brassicae were detected on canola, pea and wheat seeds as well as on potato tubers harvested from clubroot-infested fields in Alberta, Canada.


","The distinctive symptom is abnormally large roots, affecting the fine roots, secondary roots, the taproot, or even on the underground stem. Roots develop clubs (swellings) that can be 5 or 6 inches wide. The largest clubs usually are just below the soil surface on the larger roots. Affected seedlings will not show any root swellings until about 3 weeks after infection. When susceptible plants are attacked in the seedling stage, they can die. When plants are attacked at a later stage, the disease rarely kills, but roots that are severely distorted have a reduced capacity to absorb minerals and water from soil. Plants wilt in hot weather but partly recover at night. Consequently, top growth may be stunted, yellowish, and likely to prematurely bolt or to wilt in hot weather. But even with extensive root clubbing, top growth may be nearly normal.


","

1) Never allow drainage water or soil from an infested field to enter an irrigation source. Spores are moved easily in irrigation water.

2) If growing susceptible crops in suspect or infested fields, incorporate enough finely ground limestone the year before planting to raise the soil pH above 7. Use lime applications that increase soil pH as well as level of soil calcium. Thoroughly mix lime into the soil to maximize potential disease control. Lime inhibits disease development, but will not prevent a disease outbreak if the spore load in the soil is sufficiently high. Different soil types vary considerably in their response to efforts to alter the pH with lime. Therefore, measure the initial soil pH, follow Soil Moisture Potential (SMP) test recommendations, and monitor the changes after application. Periodically monitor the pH in subsequent years to determine the stability of the change.

3) If planting in a suspect or infected field, incorporating hydrated lime (1,500 lb/A) at least 6 weeks before planting, whether pH is neutral or alkaline, gives additional disease control.

4) Long rotations (6 years or longer) help prevent a pathogen buildup and reduce disease.

5) Control wild mustards if they are a weed problem.

6) The form of nitrogen fertilizer can also influence disease. Using calcium nitrate may result in less disease compared to ammonium sulfate or urea.

Rapeseed = Canola ,(Brassica napus and B. rapa = B. campestris)-Downy Mildew,"Peronospora parasitica, a fungus-like microorganism that overwinters in roots or infected plant debris, affects nearly all cultivated plants and weeds in the crucifer family. High humidity, fog, drizzle, and heavy dew favor disease development and spread. Optimum conditions for disease development are night temperatures of 46°F to 61°F for 4 or more successive nights and day temperature approximately 75°F or lower.


","The first observable symptom is small, light-green-yellow lesions on the upper leaf surface, later showing on the undersurface. The spot turns yellow as it enlarges. In high humidity, a grayish-white fungal growth is on the leaf's underside.
Spots can be seen on the outsides of stalks. Streaks of brown to purple tissue, often in a net-necrosis pattern, are on the insides of stalks. These streaks may extend up to the small florets of the curd, stunting the curd. Streaking is difficult to detect without breaking the stalk for examination.


","

1) Eradicate cruciferous weeds (wild mustards, etc.) that may harbor the fungus-like microorganism.

Rapeseed = Canola ,(Brassica napus and B. rapa = B. campestris)-Gray Mold,"The fungus, Botrytis cinerea, is an opportunistic pathogen that easily invades weak, damaged, or senescing tissue. Disease usually starts on senescing flowers and flower infections are important for subsequent spread to leaves and pods. Spores (conidia) are produced throughout the growing season under a wide range of temperatures and humidity, and stem infections are a durable inoculum source, producing conidia throughout bloom. Cool temperatures, high humidity, and free water on plant surfaces favor the disease, as do close plant spacing and irrigation practices that keep plants wet for a longer time. Durable sclerotia overwinter in soil.


","The initial symptom is a dark, water-soaked, slimy lesion, with concentric zonation and sometimes a yellowish margin. Long brown streaks form on stems and petioles. As tissues dry out, gray, powdery spore masses form. Sclerotia may also develop.


","

1) Rotate grasses, cereals, or corn for at least 2 years.

2) If the placement of irrigation equipment allows, orientating the plant rows in the direction of prevailing winds helps control gray mold as well as white mold.

3) Limit irrigation during and after bloom. Irrigate in the morning so plants do not stay wet more than 12 hours. In some areas, growers may be able to irrigate heavily before bloom and as little as possible thereafter.

4) Avoid over-fertilization with nitrogen.

5) Deep plowing will bury sclerotia in infected debris or weeds but plowing the field in later years may return viable sclerotia to the surface where they can produce apothecia or conidia.

Rapeseed = Canola ,(Brassica napus and B. rapa = B. campestris)-Light Leaf Spot,"The fungus, Cylindrosporium concentricum (sexual stage: Pyrenopeziza brassicae) has been found in Oregon on canola, turnip, volunteer or wild radish, wild mustard, volunteer black mustard, vegetable Brassica seed fields, and Brassica species used as cover crops since 2014. The disease was found during 2016 in the Skagit Valley of western Washington on Brassica cover crops and wild mustard. All Brassicas grown in the Pacific Northwest are probably susceptible but the specific host range within Brassicaceae is unknown at this time. Oilseed rape and cauliflower are reported to be more susceptible than Brussels sprouts or kale, but there is a range of susceptibility within each crop species. The pathogen has been a problem on oilseed rape in various parts of the world with seed losses estimated at 22% when outbreaks have occurred in the United Kingdom. This disease hasn't been previously reported in North America though an infected field was found in western Oregon during 1998. Oilseed rape is very susceptible and losses results from stand die-out, reduced pod numbers, premature pod ripening, or an overall growth reduction with less severe infections. Trichloroacetic acid-based herbicides may increase plant susceptibility by affecting the waxy layer of leaves.
Ascospores develop from apothecia on infected plant residues and can be wind-dispersed relatively long distances after a wetting period, infecting susceptible plants. Asexual spores (conidia) develop but spread relatively short distances by rain or splashing water, potentially causing pod infections during the following spring. Seed can be infected or casually infested with the asexual stage yet seed transmission occurs at very low rates due to rapid die-out of the pathogen on seed. Still, epidemics can be initiated by seedborne inoculum or from neighboring fields of infected plants or residues, or from infected volunteers. Wet conditions and cool temperatures (around 60°F is optimum) promote disease development. Fall-infected plants may remain symptomless through the winter season till the following spring. Light leaf spot reappeared during late February in western Oregon, but ascospores probably began infecting during the previous October and November, possibly throughout the winter.


","This fungus can attack leaves, stems and pods. Flecking may be observed on cotyledons while leaf infections start as discolored patches that develop into irregular brown lesions with cracked centers, sometimes turning black. Veins surrounding young lesions often take on an olive-brown hue and may exhibit deformities. Leaf lesions can coalesce, causing death of leaves. When leaves are infected young, distortion can develop. Stem lesions are superficial, elongated brownish streaks with grayish-black margins and can be mistaken for black leg, except decay does not affect the stem pith. Flower infections may cause abortion. Pods infected early appear distorted while pods infected later result in relatively healthy looking pods but will have white spore masses. Seedlings can be killed or plants may be stunted.


","

1) Rotate out of crucifers for 3 years.

2) Avoid planting adjacent to a field infected the previous season.

3) Control susceptible weeds and volunteer cruciferous plants.

4) Remove plant debris or bury by deep-plowing, important for preventing sexual recombinants from developing with new virulence or fungicide resistance. Flailing followed by a shallow incorporation may be sufficient depending on amount and size of plant debris as well as environmental conditions.

Rapeseed = Canola ,(Brassica napus and B. rapa = B. campestris)-Sclerotinia Stem Rot,"The soilborne fungus, Sclerotinia sclerotiorum, can attack many broadleaved plants, including common bean and canola. Sclerotinia is a serious problem on snap bean in the Willamette Valley. Carrot, chickpea, cucumber, clover, cabbage, cauliflower, lentil, field pea, potato, squash, radish are also susceptible but support less buildup of sclerotia in the soil. Many broad-leaved weeds are also susceptible, including lambsquarters, Canada thistle, ragweed, and marsh elder. Members of the grass family including small grains, corn and grassy weeds are considered immune. Sclerotinia stem rot can be considered the most serious disease of canola.
After a moisture-conditioning period, the overwintering bodies of Sclerotinia (sclerotia) germinate to produce tiny mushroom-like bodies (apothecia), which produce millions of airborne spores. The spores can be produced not only in canola fields, but also in fields of other crops, including small grains. The spores escape from the canopy and may be windborne to nearby fields. Spores may infect senescent tissue such as blossoms and leaves or may germinate and colonize plant debris. After colonizing, the fungus can invade any part of the plant with which it comes in contact. The pathogen survives as sclerotia in or on the soil. Some sclerotia may survive as long as six years or more. Moist conditions within the plant canopy favor infection, as do rain, dew, and/or irrigation practices that keep foliage wet for long periods.


","The disease is mainly on aboveground parts, producing a soft, watery rot. Diseased tissues eventually bleach white. Sclerotia that are black on the surface and white inside, associated with this bleached tissue, are diagnostic. On seed crops, stem infections can cause wilting and plant death, resulting yield losses. Affected plants may be more erect due to lack of pod fill.


","

1) Rotate using nonsusceptible crops such as grass or grains.

2) Encourage maximum air movement between rows.

","According to research in North Dakota, fungicide applications for Sclerotinia control in canola are economic only when Sclerotinia has been a problem in the area, rainy/humid weather is expected to continue, and if canola yield is expected to be at least 2,000 lb/A when canola prices are minimal.

Rapeseed = Canola ,(Brassica napus and B. rapa = B. campestris)-Seed Rot and Damping-off,"Damping-off can be caused by Pythium spp., Fusarium spp., Rhizoctonia solani, Alternaria spp., and other fungi. These soilborne pathogens attack young seedlings of many vegetables in the Willamette Valley, including members of the genus Brassica, as well as cause root rot of more mature plants. These soilborne fungi can persist indefinitely in soil or plant debris. If seedlings are affected before emergence, it appears as poor germination. If the decay is after emergence, seedlings that fall over or die are said to ""damp-off."" The destructiveness of this disease depends on the level of pathogens in the soil and on environmental conditions. Wet, cool soils are especially favorable for the development of damping-off.

Rapeseed = Canola ,(Brassica napus and B. rapa = B. campestris)-White Leaf Spot and Gray Stem,"The fungus, Pseudocercosporella capsellae (sexual stage: Mycosphaerella capsellae), has been observed in various Brassica vegetable and seed crops in Oregon. It has been reported in oilseed rape in the United Kingdow and Canada. Pod losses of 15% have been reported in Europe. Turnip, Chinese cabbage, mustards and oilseed rape are thought to be more susceptible than cabbage, cauliflower, broccoli and other vegetable Brassica species. Horseradish and radish are susceptible to white leaf spot as well as weedy types such as wild radish, wild mustard, and shepherd's purse.
Ascospores develop on infected Brassica or Raphanus residues during the autumn and possibly winter or spring months; these ascospores are wind-dispersed relatively long distances following rain or dew events. After a successful infection, asexual spores (conidia) subsequently develop in the leaf spots and are spread relatively short distances by rain or splashing water, causing secondary spread, including pod and seed infections. Seed transmission has not been reported to play a major role in disease outbreaks; infected crop residues are usually necessary for large-scale outbreaks, but seed transmission can lead to introduction of disease into new areas. Temperatures of 50°F to 60°F under moist conditions promote disease development.


","This fungus can attack leaves, stems and pods. Tan, irregular or roundish spots develop on leave, especially leaf tips and edges, later becoming ashy-gray to white with a brownish margin and sometimes a yellowish halo. White conidia can be observed on the underside of leaf spots. Leaf spots will become dark brown as leaves senesce, due to the initiation of the sexual stage. The center of older lesions may fall out, resulting in a shot hole appearance. Lesions may coalesce when disease is severe, resulting in defoliation. Stem lesions are elongated and first brown, turning ashy-gray to white with a brownish margin and numerous tiny dark specks due to the formation of the sexual stage; there is a distinct boundary between diseased and healthy tissue on the stem. Gray stem lesions are superficial; the pith is not severely infected helping to distinguish gray stem from black leg. Pod infections are at first small brown spots that expand and turn grayish-white with numerous tiny dark specks due to the formation of the sexual stage.

Rapeseed = Canola ,(Brassica napus and B. rapa = B. campestris)-White Rust,"Albugo candida, a fungus-like microorganism, can cause disease on broccoli, cabbage, radish, rapeseed, and wild mustards. Crucifers in general are potential hosts, as well as spinach and horseradish. In the Pacific Northwest, white rust can be severe on crucifer seed crops. The pathogen overwinters as oospores in stagheads (galls formed on infected seed heads) or plant debris as well as mycelium in infected hosts. Pieces of staghorns are often found as seed contaminants and can be the primary source of infection in a field. The oospores can germinate and infect young plants, leading to pustules on leaves. Sporangia are produced in pustules, can be moved by wind, rain, or insects, and can germinate, giving rise to zoospores. Zoospores are motile; they swim for a short distance and then invade the plant by germinating through the stomata. Sporangia require some drying in order to germinate but disease development is favored by moist conditions and temperatures between 50°F and 77°F. Dew, fog, or periods of extended rainfall and cool temperatures are ideal for zoospore activity. White rust is often =associated with downy mildew.


","First symptoms may appear as small, light green spots, which later turn white and finally result in blister-like, raised, white pustules, usually on the lower leaf surface. Pustules can develop on the upper or lower leaf surfaces or on stems and consist of masses of sporangia. Systemic infections can occur, causing the aboveground portion of young seedlings to be distorted and appear abnormally shaped. Infections of the flower parts may cause a bizarre outgrowth on the seed stalk. Seed pedicels may terminate and form staghorns without seeds developing. Seed yield and quality are severely reduced.


","

1) Plant only seed grown in white rust-free plantings.

2) Avoid sprinkler irrigation.

3) Practice a 3-year rotation between susceptible crops.

Early-season infections are more severe than late-season ones.


","Circular sunken spots, about 0.12 inch or more in diameter, form on lower canes. At first, infections are purplish; later, the center turns gray. As canes age, spots become sunken, and margins are raised and purplish. Current-season canes show initial symptoms near the ground. Most infection is on the side of the cane toward the plant's center and from 6 to 30 inches up the cane. Infection often results in uneven berry ripening.

Raspberry ,(Rubus spp.)-Cane Blight,"Kalmusia coniothyrium (formerly Leptosphaeria coniothyrium), a fungus that overwinters on old cane stubs and near wounds on infected fruiting canes. Cane blight may weaken fruiting canes of red raspberry. It may attack black raspberry at points where canes have been snapped off or pruned to force lateral growth. 'Boysenberry', 'Loganberry', and 'Youngberry' canes are seldom infected with cane blight unless canes first are frozen, pruned, or mechanically damaged. This pathogen is a wound invader. Wounds from the fruit-catching plates of mechanical harvesters have resulted in primocane infections. Cane blight rarely is a problem in hand-harvested fields. Rain or overhead irrigation during harvest has increased disease incidence because spores are disseminated in splashing water. Young canes are more rapidly infected while older canes of raspberry are more resistant to infection in the fall.


","Symptoms beyond the wound do not appear on the canes until fall or during the fruiting year. The fungus invades through wounds such as from a mechanical harvester or, on some red cultivars, yellow rust lesions near the ground. The infected area flattens and may crack open. Infected canes are easily broken at the wound due to cellulose degradation by the fungus. Severely infected canes often are girdled. In floricane-fruiting raspberries, primocane infections can lead to girdling of the following season's floricanes causing poor fruit development, wilting, and early death of floricanes ending in significant yield losses.
On trailing berries, blighted canes turn gray and often show black specks containing the fungal fruiting bodies (pycnidia). On 'Munger' black raspberry canes, dark-almost-black elliptical lesions develop with gray or necrotic centers.
Diagnostic lesions are internal. Scrape the affected cane with a knife to expose vascular tissue. Healthy tissue should be moist and light green; the canker will be orangish-red. Vascular discoloration generally extends above and below the external wound.


","

1) Remove infected canes.

2) Prune black raspberry in dry weather to force lateral growth so wounds will heal before getting wet again.

Raspberry ,(Rubus spp.)-Crown and Cane Gall,"Agrobacterium tumefaciens and A. rubi are the two bacterial pathogens associated with crown gall on raspberry. Both pathogens reside in soil or on plant surfaces and can infect herbaceous and woody plants from many plant families. Once present in a field they can survive for years in the soil as saprophytes. They are spread by splashing rain, irrigation water, pruning tools, wind, insects, farm machinery, and on contaminated propagation material (cuttings, grafting stock). These bacteria are wound pathogens, and infection occurs through injuries to the crown and roots. Natural wounds include lateral root formation, leaf scars, and winter injury. Mechanical injuries occur during pruning, training, and harvesting. Infections occurring during the first growing season after planting are the most severe and can stunt or kill plants. Once infected, Agrobacterium causes plant cells to reproduce rapidly, resulting in swollen branches, roots, and gall formation. Crown gall is more severe in the presence of the root-lesion nematode and root-attacking insects.
'Willamette' is highly resistant; 'Nootka' and 'Canby' have intermediate resistance in the absence of nematode damage. 'Skeena', 'Chilliwack', and 'Haida' are susceptible.


","Crown gall is characterized by the presence of knobby galls on branches, the bases of canes, and on major roots. Young galls are a spherical mass of disorganized tissues and are cream-to-light-brown in color and soft and spongy in texture. Older galls turn brown-to-black and become woody and hard. They first appear in spring with the beginning of warm weather and increase in size during the summer. Galls may be scattered in discrete masses on infected roots and branches or they may occur in linear strips of contiguous bumps. Galls also may form at pruning wounds or where canes have been injured by bending or training. As galls grow larger, infected canes split and dry out. Symptoms on severely infected canes include stunting, leaf chlorosis, small and seedy fruit, wilting, and possibly death. In fall, galls near the soil darken and begin to decompose. Although galls may die over the winter, new galls may erupt the following spring near the old galls.


","

1) Use certified nursery stock from fields where gall has not been found.

2) Inspect planting stock and do not plant new canes that show galls on canes, crowns, or roots.

3) Plant resistant cultivars.

4) If only a few plants are infected, remove them from the field and destroy them.

5) Establish new plantings on uninfested land wherever possible.

6) Prune canes only during dry weather and frequently disinfect pruning equipment.

7) Use care when harvesting and training, so not to injure canes.

8) Preplant soil solarization has been helpful in reducing populations of certain soilborne pathogens and weeds in western Oregon. Place clear plastic (preferably anti-condensation film) directly on smooth, rototilled ground, which has been irrigated to field capacity and then allowed to drain for 1-2 days. Bury the edges of the plastic to trap the heat. Solarize for 4-6 weeks (or longer) during the hottest part of the summer, beginning in early- to mid-July.

",,"Dipping the roots and crown area of blackberry plants in commercial preparations of the bacterium A. radiobacter K84 or strain K1026 before planting provided good protection for at least the first year, thus helping the plants to become well established. Follow manufacturer's directions. To be effective it must be applied a few hours after wounding. Change solution frequently because if a set of plants contaminated with other pathogens is dipped then all succeeding plants dipped into the same container/solution will become contaminated.

Raspberry ,(Rubus spp.)-Crumbly Fruit,"A virus complex consisting of Raspberry bushy dwarf virus (RBDV) and Raspberry leaf mottle virus (RLMV), Raspberry latent virus (RpLV), and/or Black raspberry necrosis virus (BRNV). The cultivar Meeker had more severe growth reductions when infected by RBDV and RLMV; whereas crumbly fruit was more prominent when infected by RBDV and RpLV or three viruses together (RBDV, RLMV, and RpLV). RBDV is spread by pollen while the others are aphid-vectored. RLMV spread rate is much higher than that of RpLV, which needs a 6 to 7 day period in the aphid to become transmissible.The disease can be found on many red and black raspberry cultivars as well as 'Boysenberry', 'Loganberry', and 'Marionberry' blackberries. Entire fields may become infected with the virus within 3 to 5 years of planting, depending on inoculum pressure from adjacent fields. The fruit from infected plants often will not make IQF grade and is sold as a lower value produce for juice, jam or puree. Since pollen is infected with RBDV honeybees play an important role in moving infected pollen from plant to plant.
A survey of RpLV and RLMV in Washington and Oregon revealed that the two viruses are present at high incidence in northern Washington; whereas the incidence in southern Washington and Oregon, where crumbly fruit is not a serious problem, was considerably lower. BRNV is more common in Oregon and southern Washington.


","The virus complex may not produce symptoms on the foliage of many cultivars but may cause crumbly fruit as in Meeker. Many drupelets abort, which causes the fruit to crumble at harvest or postharvest during IQF freezing, resulting in significant reductions of yield and fruit quality. On 'Puyallup', bright-yellow areas along the leaf's main and smaller veins give the leaves a ""network"" appearance. Severely affected leaves are almost completely bright yellow. In some red raspberry cultivars, faint ring and line patterns develop on leaves. The disease reduces cane growth and fruit yield in 'Meeker' and 'Canby' red raspberry but the major impact is a reduction in fruit quality. In the black raspberry 'Munger', both reduced growth and crumbly fruit occur. Though many cultivars are symptomless when infected with only one of the viruses, 'Autumn Bliss' develops bright yellow leaves and crumbly fruit when plants are infected with RBDV alone. As far as is known all blackberries are symptomless when infected with any one of these viruses, thus can serve as inoculum sources for new fields planted nearby. In blackberry, RBDV in mixed infections with BRNV and/or Blackberry calico virus can cause drupelet abortion and misshapen fruit, though it has been much less of a problem in blackberry than in red raspberry.


","

1) Use certified planting stock.

2) Plant resistant cultivars, such as Willamette, Chilcotin, Haida, Comox, Heritage, Cowichan, and Cascade Harvest; however, some strains of the virus may infect 'Willamette' or 'Cascade Harvest'. The cultivar Wakefield has a high level of field resistance.

3) Plant in large blocks to slow movement into new plants, especially if fields in the immediate area are infected.

4) Isolate new plantings from  fields known to be infected. This requires testing, as many cultivars are symptomless when infected with only one of the viruses.

5) Place honey bee hives in the centers of new fields, rather than along the edge, to reduce the risk of bees carrying the virus in from nearby fields that contain infected plants.

6) Management of aphid insect vectors is helpful to reduce symptom severity especially 2 to 3 weeks prior to harvest

Raspberry ,(Rubus spp.)-Fruit Rot and Cane Botrytis,"A survey in 2015 found the majority of isolates to be Botrytis cinerea, a fungus that causes blossom blight, preharvest rot, postharvest rot, and cane infections. Crop losses can exceed 50% in years when rains persist through bloom and into harvest. On raspberry, it overwinters as sclerotia on canes and mycelia in dead leaves and mummified fruit. Sclerotia produce conidia in spring. A moist, humid environment is ideal for pathogen sporulation and spread. Spores are dispersed mainly by wind, but can also be moved by splashing rain or irrigation water. Spores require free water on plant surfaces to germinate and infect. Wet weather (such as rain, heavy dew, fog, or even irrigation) just before and during bloom is important for disease development. All flower parts except sepals are very susceptible. Initial infections of flowers are latent such that the fungus is dormant until fruit ripens. Airborne spore concentrations rise and remain elevated during and after harvest. Fruit rot may be more prevalent in wet weather, in fields under overhead set irrigation systems, or where fruit overripens in the field for mechanical harvest. Conidia can infect mature or senescent leaves, resulting in floricane and sometimes primocane infections through petioles. Cane infections can also initiate through wounds.


","Rotted fruit, usually with tufts of gray fungus growing on all or part of the berry. In some years, only a few drupelets on a berry may have a fungal growth. Infected berries rarely leak juice. Receptacles of picked fruit also may be colonized and become gray with fungal spores. Rotten fruit may mummify and stay attached to the receptacle. Pale-brown lesions may appear on primocane leaves in mid- to late summer.
A brown, shield-shape lesion may initially be seen around a cane node, which indicates infection via a colonized leaf petiole. This shield shape will be lost as the lesion expands. Cane infections between nodes appear as tan-to brown-lesions and expand in both directions often encompassing more than one node. Cane lesions exhibit typical concentric ""watermark"" patterns from late summer through late winter. Sclerotia may be visible on canes as shiny, black, blister-like structures. Sclerotia appear on spent floricanes during early fall and later on primocanes in late fall and throughout the winter. Young damaged primocanes may be killed when lesions girdle the cane. Lesions on older primocanes usually do not kill the canes.


","No single cultural practice provides adequate management of gray mold under highly conducive conditions. Integrate several tactics to manage this disease. The use of cultural tactics reduces reliance on fungicide applications and can help manage fungicide resistance.

1) 'Munger', 'Chilliwack', 'Comox', 'Fairview', and 'Meeker' have shown moderate resistance to Botrytis fruit rot. 'Chilcotin', 'Nootka', and 'Willamette' have shown resistance to Botrytis cane infections.

2) Create an open plant canopy: use a double top wire training system, prune, avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, and control weeds. These practices improve air circulation, increase light penetration, and speed drying of plant surfaces after irrigation and rain.

3) Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization.

4) Pick fruit in the coolest part of the day. Keep harvested fruit in shade while in the field, and then move to cold storage as soon as possible. Pick frequently so that berries do not become overripe.

5) Control early-season primocanes.

6) Adjust irrigation so plants do not stay wet for extended periods of time. Switch from overhead to drip/trickle irrigation.

7) Remove fall fruit during tying time.

","Spray first at 5% bloom and again 7 to 10 days later. Applications during the growing season, especially preharvest, aid control when wet weather is expected. Thorough coverage and canopy penetration are essential. Fungal strains can become tolerant to a fungicide when it is used exclusively in a spray schedule. To reduce the possibility of tolerance, alternate or tank-mix fungicides that have different modes of action. Minimize the use of any one group of fungicides to no more than twice a year. Strains resistant to 5 different modes of action have been reported from Germany. Resistance to Group 2, 9 and 17 fungicides have been documented in northern Washington. Discontinuation of Group 2 fungicides for many years has resulted in increased sensitivity and allowed its limited reuse once again in this area.

Raspberry ,"(Rubus spp.)-Nematode, Dagger","Xiphinema americanum and related species are vectors of Tomato ringspot virus (ToRSV). Xiphinema bakeri, another dagger nematode, has not been shown to transmit viruses. Dagger nematodes are migratory ectoparasites found only in soil. As virus vectors, they can be damaging at very low population levels. Dagger nematode populations are low in late summer when other nematodes are abundant. Highest populations are found during the winter and are correlated with rainfall. They only have one generation per year in western Washington. Transmission of the virus is suspected to occur in the early fall and spring when soil moisture and temperature are optimal for nematode activity. Transmission is slow and generally to adjacent plants; however, new foci can develop if soil, which contains nematodes, is moved within a field.


","Feeding by X. bakeri causes swellings and fishhook-like curling of the root tips. Stunting of the roots leads to reduced cane growth. The decline is similar to that described for plants attacked by the root-lesion nematode. In the absence of Tomato ringspot virus, X. americanum group nematodes cause little direct root damage.


","

1) Use certified planting stock.

2) Plant in soil that has been tested and found free of dagger nematodes.

3) If the nematode is detected, plant a shallow-rooted grass crop for 2 years. The shallow roots bring the nematodes to the upper portion of the soil profile, where they are more easily controlled with fumigants. Planting a non-host crop reduces virus inoculum because the nematodes cannot reacquire the virus.

4) Remove infected plants and treat the soil with a fumigant to limit virus spread.

5) Weed control is important since many broadleaf weeds (such as dandelion) are hosts for the nematode as well as the virus.

","


1) Preplant soil fumigation the fall before spring planting is necessary to control dagger nematodes. Growing a shallow-rooted grass crop for 1 to 2 years will bring nematodes to upper soil levels where fumigation more easily controls them.

Raspberry ,"(Rubus spp.)-Nematode, Root-lesion","The root-lesion nematode Pratylenchus penetrans is a migratory endoparasite where part of the population is in soil and part in the roots at all times. Populations in raspberry generally are low through winter and spring, increase rapidly through the summer, and decline in fall. Densities at or below detectable levels at planting can increase to damaging levels by the sixth-to-eighth year. Other species of this nematode do not cause significant root damage. Most of red raspberry varieties commonly planted in the PNW are good hosts for this nematode.


","Small, elongated, discolored lesions appear on new roots of infected plants. The fine-feeder roots die as the damage increases. This damage stimulates the formation of many fine roots and a witches' broom appearance. Without feeder roots, the larger diameter roots are unable to take up nutrients and water and often are invaded by secondary fungi. Aboveground symptoms are most often observed on fruiting canes and include reduced cane number and diameter, stunting, and off-color leaves.


","

1) Use certified planting stock.

2) Plant in soil free of high populations of root-lesion nematodes.

Raspberry ,(Rubus spp.)-Orange Rust,,,,,
Raspberry ,(Rubus spp.)-Powdery Mildew,"Podosphaera macularis (formerly Sphaerotheca macularis), a fungus. Powdery mildew is occasionally a serious disease on foliage, new canes, and fruit of red raspberry in the Pacific Northwest. It also can infect 'Loganberry' leaves. The fungus overwinters as mycelium in dormant buds of stunted cane tips or as chasmothecia. Optimum conditions for spore germination and infection are 65°F to 80°F with relative humidity of 97% to 99%. In May, leaves develop lesions that produce fungal spores that are blown to healthy foliage. In June small, secondary-infection lesions appear on vegetative tissue and developing fruit.
Powdery mildew also attacks 'Munger' black raspberry, 'Himalaya', and some other blackberries. The 'Puyallup' red raspberry is very susceptible, so powdery mildew may be a limiting factor with that cultivar. 'Canby', 'Fairview', 'Haida"", 'Skeena', 'Wakefield', and 'Washington' are sometimes infected. 'Amity', 'Cascade Bounty', 'Chilcotin', 'Heritage, 'Rudi, 'Sumner', and 'Willamette' are resistant. The powdery mildew of raspberry does not infect strawberry and that of strawberry does not infect raspberry despite the similar name.


","A whitish-gray powdery coat covers foliage, young growing tips of canes, and fruit. The first lesions on infected leaves are generally on the lower-leaf surface causing light green blotches on the upper surface. Infected shoot tips may be covered with mycelial growth. Severe mildew retards, dwarfs, and distorts plant parts. Infected fruit may become covered with a white, mealy mat of fungus. Severely infected berries fail to size properly and wither and die.


","

1) Do not plant close to wooded areas that might shade the field.

2) Plant more-resistant cultivars.

3) Remove any infected primocanes that occur late in the season.

Raspberry ,(Rubus spp.)-Ringspot,"Tomato ringspot virus (ToRSV), which is spread at a rate of about 6 ft. a year in the row by dagger nematodes (Xiphinema americanum and possibly related species. It is common in red raspberry in the northern Willamette Valley in Oregon and in Clark County in southern Washington. Besides red raspberry, the virus infects some cultivated and wild blackberries and raspberry-blackberry hybrids such as Boysen. The native hosts of ToRSV and the dagger nematode are numerous and include many common weeds such as dandelion and chickweed. These plants can serve as sources of inoculum in and around raspberry fields. The rate of natural spread is about 6 to 8 feet per year along the row, while the spread from row-to-row is slower. An infected nematode can transmit the virus to plant hosts for several months. Soil adhering to machinery can move the infected nematodes within fields and to other fields.


","Symptoms usually are most noticeable in newly infected plants. Leaf symptoms vary from mottled, chlorotic, mosaic leaves to leaf curling and ring spotting. Delayed emergence of primocanes may also occur. Infected plants often show no symptoms but have low vigor and yield. The virus also may cause crumbly fruit. On some cultivars it causes a severe dwarfing that resembles root-rot damage. Many red raspberry cultivars are susceptible; affected plants of Fairview die quickly. 'Canby', 'Puyallup', 'Meeker', 'Willamette' and probably most cultivars are susceptible to Tomato ringspot virus and are severely weakened when affected.


","

1) Do not plant in soil containing  spp.

2) Use certified planting stock.

3) Fallow a site for 18 months prior to replanting to eliminate nematodes.

4) Use a cover crop for a year that is a non-host for ToRSV such as sudan grass that allows the nematodes to multiply. This flushes the virus from the nematode.

5) Rogue out and destroy suspicious or diseased plants from fields once the presence of  has been confirmed. In addition to the diseased plants, rogue out at least the next five plants beyond the last plant in which you see symptoms because they probably are infected already. If more than 5% of the plants in a field are diseased, the value of roguing is doubtful.

6) Clean equipment thoroughly between operations to remove soil-containing nematodes.

7) Begin operations in fields that are not dagger-nematode-infested before moving to infested fields.

8) Control weeds such as dandelion. Establish a perennial grass in the alleyways to minimize soil movement on equipment. This greatly reduces the spread of  in the field.

9) Maintain adequate fertility.

Raspberry ,(Rubus spp.)-Root Rot,"Phytophthora rubi, a fungal-like organism, causes a destructive root rot on red raspberry cultivars throughout the region. Damage is most severe in fields with poor drainage that may be the result of heavy soils with greater clay content, hardpans, excessive irrigation, or low-lying areas where water collects. This fungal-like microorganism survives as mycelia and as thick-walled oospores that are produced in dying and dead raspberry plant tissues. As the dead plant tissues decompose, oospores are released into soil. Under saturated conditions in winter or spring, swimming zoospores are produced that swim to nearby roots and initiate infection. Small roots rot quickly, and infection moves up into larger structural roots and then into the lower canes.
Root-lesion nematodes and dagger nematodes also also contribute to raspberry root decline and rot, particularly in northern Washington.
'Anne', 'Canby', 'Comox', 'Qualicum', 'Malahat' and 'Skeena' are very susceptible; 'Amity', 'Chilcotin', 'Nootka', and 'Willamette' are susceptible; and 'Chilliwack', 'Meeker', 'Sumner', and 'Summit' are moderately resistant. Young 'Meeker' plants are very susceptible but mature plants seem to have some field tolerance. 'Cascade Bounty' and 'Cascade Delight' are very resistant. In Idaho trials, 'Killarney' and 'Summit' have performed well on heavily infested soils.


","The most noticeable symptom is wilting and death of canes from early spring to late summer. Wilting often coincides with the onset of warmer, drier conditions. Leaves on infected canes may turn yellow or bronze, wilt, and develop scorch symptoms before dying. Dead leaves usually remain on the stem. Floricanes often start to die just as the fruit begins to ripen in June, causing the fruit to be undersized or to wither before ripening. Primocanes usually begin to wilt from the tip down. Primocane tips bend over, exposing the silvery undersurfaces of the leaves forming a shepherd's crook. New primocanes may also be killed before they break the soil surface. In many cases, one or a few canes of a plant may die while the rest remain healthy. Often, multiple plants in low lying areas of the field die, leaving large open patches known as disease pockets.
Lesions are formed on the roots and may extend up into the canes. If the epidermis of the infected area is scraped off, a sharp transition zone is visible between the healthy root and stem tissues (white or bright-green) and the diseased, rotted tissues (reddish-brown). Excavation of compromised root systems reveal that most larger-diameter roots are dead and that there are few, if any, smaller-diameter feeder roots. New roots may form above the decayed root system during the summer and the plants may appear to recover, but infection resumes during the cold and wet weather of fall and winter.
May be confused with crown borer damage, Verticillium wilt, Armillaria root rot, or cane blight.


","Best results occur when several cultural and chemical practices are integrated together.

1) Use certified planting stock and set out in fertile, deep, well-drained soil (3- to 4-ft water table in winter) that has not grown small fruit (strawberry, raspberry, brambles) for several years.

2) Keep affected plantings economically productive as long as possible by good cultural and fertilizing practices.

3) Plant resistant cultivars if available.

4) Subsoil in alleyways to promote drainage away from plants in winter.

5) Install drain tiles in field to improve drainage.

6) Plant in beds raised so that the top of the bed is at least 12 inches above the surrounding soil. Amend soil with gypsum (6 tons/A) before making raised beds and planting.

7) Slope soil away from plants to the center of the alleyway between rows.

8) Preplant soil solarization has been helpful in western Washington but not Idaho. Place clear plastic (preferably anti-condensation film) directly on smooth, rototilled ground, which has been irrigated to field capacity and then allowed to drain for 1-2 days. Bury the edges of the plastic to trap the heat. Solarize for 4-6 weeks (or longer) during the hottest part of the summer, beginning in early- to mid-July. Use in combination with other techniques.

","Results are best when several cultural and chemical practices are integrated. Limit the use of any one group during crop production.


1) Preplant soil fumigation may be effective for severe root rot, but it delays disease onset only a few years.

2) Spring and/or fall applications to the foliage or soil. Group 4-based products tend to be more effective than Group 33-based products when resistance is not an issue. Rotate applications between these materials to help prevent building up resistant populations.

Raspberry ,(Rubus spp.)-Spur Blight,"Xenodidymella applanata (formerly Didymella applanata), a fungus. The disease is found in western Oregon and Washington on red raspberry, 'Loganberry', and 'Youngberry'. The 'Willamette' cultivar of red raspberry is readily infected by spur blight but also is tolerant and can produce a satisfactory crop even if disease incidence is high.
From early April, mature black fruiting bodies (pseudothecia and later pycnidia) can be found in the gray affected areas of cane tissue. Pseudothecia discharge ascospores in wet weather and continuing until dry weather prevails ( end of June). Ascospores infect leaves on fruiting-cane laterals and on emerging primocanes. Under very favorable conditions, the fungus may infect laterals and pedicels directly.


","Numerous brown necrotic spots (centered on veins) form on fruiting-cane leaves when rainy weather persists into late spring. Infected leaves become chlorotic and drop prematurely when the disease is severe. In contrast, infected primocane leaves develop brown V-shape lesions. The fungus then grows through the petiole to the cane and invades cane tissue around the bud, producing a brown-purple diseased area. Buds also may be reduced in size even if the fungus has not grown through the petiole. Buds on infected canes are more susceptible to winter injury, and fruiting laterals may be stunted. If the disease spreads along the canes (as in the Ashland, OR district) young canes turn brown up to 20 inches from the ground. Infected areas tend to turn gray in winter. Can be confused with cane Botrytis.


","

1) Remove and destroy old fruiting canes after harvest.

2) Keep plant rows narrow.

3) Minimize or adjust irrigation so plants are not wet for long periods. Switch to drip/trickle irrigation.

4) Practice good weed control.

5) Control early primocane growth.

6) Plant resistant or tolerant cultivars such as 'Meeker' or 'Willamette', respectively.

Raspberry ,(Rubus spp.)-Stamen Blight,,,,,
Raspberry ,(Rubus spp.)-Verticillium Wilt,"Verticillium dahliae, a fungus that has been reported in the PNW. The disease is particularly serious in black raspberry. It also attacks red raspberry but rarely. It is more often in 'Loganberry' and 'Youngberry' than in the 'Marion' and 'Evergreen' trailing berries. The fungus may live saprophytically in soil many years but can attack susceptible plant roots whenever they are placed in infested ground. The fungus grows into the xylem where it colonizes the plant through mycelial growth and conidial production. Fluid movement in the xylem passively transports the conidia. Once in the xylem, this fungus partially blocks water movement and produces toxins that result in wilt symptoms. Once the plant tissue dies, the fungus produces microsclerotia within the recently killed plant tissue, which are released into the soil as the tissues decompose. Interactions with the root-lesion nematode can increase disease incidence and severity. Infected plants may also be more prone to winter damage.


","New canes often wilt in mid-late summer with the onset of warmer weather.. Bluish stripes or ribbons of infected tissue may extend up the canes from the ground. Wilted foliage ultimately takes on a scorched appearance from the bottom up, leaving a tuft of green leaves at the tip. Blades of wilted foliage drop prematurely, but the petiole often remains attached to the cane. Plants decline and eventually die. Initially, just one or a few canes on a plant may be affected, indicating that only a portion of the root system or crown has been damaged. Eventually, an entire clump may succumb. Disease plants may often be distributed in the field in discrete patches called ""disease pockets.""


","This disease is virtually impossible to eradicate once it has been introduced into a field. Therefore, preventing its movement and establishment into clean fields is an important strategy for avoiding Verticillium wilt.

1) Remove infected plants, and the plants on either side, to eliminate wilt spread. Do not replant where infections occurred.

2) Do not track soil from infested areas into clean areas. Clean boots, equipment, and tools before leaving an infested area.

3) Avoid planting after other susceptible crops, which may increase rather than lower the soil's  content. Susceptible crops include potato, tomato, strawberry, caneberry, stone fruit, eggplant, pepper, and, among nursery trees, maple, as well as many common weeds in the nightshade family.

4) Plant only certified berry stock.

5) Where possible, select well-drained land for black raspberry that has never grown that or other susceptible crops.

","Preplant soil fumigation is economical if Verticillium and root-lesion nematodes are in soil.


1) Telone C-17 at 30 to 50 fl oz/1000 ft of row using a single chisel per row on mineral soils. Allow 2 to 3 weeks between treating and planting or until odor leaves soil. Do not treat extremely heavy soils. 5-day reentry.

2) Vapam HL at 37.5 to 75 gal/A. Immediately roll the soil and follow up with tarps or a light watering. May use through an irrigation system. 5-day reentry.

Raspberry ,(Rubus spp.)-Viruses,"There are several important virus diseases of raspberry and black raspberry in the Pacific Northwest. Pollenborne viruses include Raspberry bushy dwarf virus and Strawberry necrotic shock virus(SNSV). SNSV is common but symptomless in field-run 'Munger' and 'Boysenberry'. SNSV will spread from infected 'Boysenberry' to immediately adjoining red raspberry rows, where it causes no obvious symptoms or crop loss. This virus is transmitted by thrips in strawberry and there is some evidence it can be transmitted by thrips to Rubus spp. since there can be low levels of transmission in plants that are not flowering. It can be detected serologically or by RT-PCR..
Tomato ringspot virus is not common but can be very damaging when it infects raspberry. It has not been observed in blackberry in the PNW, even in fields where blackberries were planted and which had severely declining red raspberry that was infected with Tomato ringspot virus. It has been reported in blackberry in other parts of the world. The dagger nematode is the vector for the disease raspberry ringspot caused by the Tomato ringspot virus. This virus has a broad host range, which means that the virus-carrying vector may be in the soil when a raspberry field is planted. In such cases symptoms may appear in the second or third year after planting.
Several viruses are spread by aphids. The Raspberry mosaic virus disease complex, composed of five different viruses, is transmitted by the large raspberry aphid. It is more common in Washington than Oregon. 'Canby', 'Chilliwack', 'Comox', 'Nootka', and 'Skeena' are resistant to the vector aphid's colonization. A new biotype of the aphid appeared in the late 1990s that overcomes the resistance used in the British Columbia breeding program. The impact of this new aphid biotype is yet to be seen, but it is expected to be more important in Washington than Oregon. Raspberry leaf mottle virus (RLMV) and Raspberry latent virus (RpLV) are aphid-vectored and involved with RBDV in the crumbly fruit disease. RLMV is considered the most wide spread virus on raspberry in the PNW.
Black raspberry decline is a disease of major concern to black raspberry growers in Oregon caused by the North American strain of the Black raspberry necrosis virus. This virus is vectored nonpersistently by the large raspberry aphid and the green peach aphid. Fields typically are in production for three or four growing seasons before they succumb to disease and no longer remain profitable. Black raspberry necrosis virus is symptomless in red raspberry but in mixed infections with other viruses leads to increased disease severity.


","Crumbly fruit is characterized by the abortion of many drupelets which causes the fruit to crumble at harvest, resulting in significant reductions of yield and fruit quality. Reduced plant growth and leaf patterns may also occur.
Ringspot symptoms vary from mottled, chlorotic, mosaic leaves to leaf curling and ring spotting. Infected plants often show no symptoms but have low vigor and yield. In the case of Tomato ringspot virus, young leaves on primocanes often show a chevron pattern and ringspot early in the season.
Raspberry mosaic disease may cause mild leaf mottling, blistering, or vein banding. Certain cultivars may also be symptomless.
Black raspberry decline is initially displayed as leaf chlorosis and puckering. Eventually, the fruiting canes prematurely die back, resulting in rapid and severe reduction in yield.


","

1) Use certified planting stock.

2) Plant immune or resistant cultivars if available.

3) Plant in large blocks to slow movement of pollenborne viruses into new plants, especially if fields in the immediate area are infected.

4) Test for nematodes before planting and do not plant in soil containing  spp.

5) Control known insect vectors. Aphid flights peak in late April to early May and again in September, in Oregon and in mid-June in northern Washington. These are the most critical periods for controlling aphid vectors. See the  for details.

Raspberry ,(Rubus spp.)-Yellow Rust,"Phragmidium rubi-idaei, a fungus widespread in red raspberry in western Oregon and Washington, particularly in years when spring rains continue late. Historically, rust has not been a problem in the 'Canby', 'Chilcotin' 'Newburgh', 'Puyallup', or 'Sumner' cultivars. However, new races are in the Pacific Northwest that will infect cultivars previously resistant, such as Meeker and Willamette.
The fungus overwinters as teliospores on leaves. When infected leaves are trapped between canes, when they are tied to the top trellis wire, the fungus starts the disease the following spring at the top of the plant.


","Leaf infections in spring and early summer create a yellowish spotting on the upper leaf surface. At first the spots are very small, yellow to orange and slightly raised (spermagonia) but then new, yellow to orangish spore bearing structures (aecia) are produced in a ring around these spots. By summer, another yellow spore stage (uredinia) appears on the lower leaf surface. Some of these structures could be described as ""orangish,"" without a good comparison. Fruit often dies on the canes before maturing if leaves on fruiting laterals are attacked early in the summer. By harvest, black overwintering spores (teliospores) appear in the yellow uredinia on the lower leaf surface. Defoliation of severely infected leaves is common. All succulent plant parts are subject to infection, but cane lesions rarely are observed. Infected canes often are brittle and may break off when old fruiting canes are pruned out.


","

1) Burying fallen leaves, old cane stubs, and refuse before new leaves appear will help eliminate inoculum sources.

2) In home gardens, destroy fallen leaves and other refuse.

3) Remove and burn old fruiting canes as soon after harvest as possible, cutting flush with the ground. Cultivate as soon as weather permits.

4) Strip leaves from primocanes before tying.

5) Postpone trellising primocanes until leaves drop off.

6) Primocane suppression eliminates susceptible tissues when rust spores are present on fruiting cane leaves.

7) Control cane vigor to improve air circulation in the plant canopy, which hastens drying of leaves and canes.

Redbud ,(Cercis spp.)-Verticillium Wilt,"Only Verticillium dahliae has been isolated from infected Cercis species located throughout Oregon. Older reports often misidentify the pathogen as V. albo-atrum, another closely-related soilborne pathogen. The two fungi have since been separated as different species. Verticillium dahliae produces discrete clusters of thick-walled melanized cells called microsclerotia while V. albo-atrum only produces thick-walled, melanized hyphae. All Cercis species tested, including C. canadensis, C. chinensis, C. occidentalis, and C. siliquastrum are susceptible. Many other plant species including weeds, other woody plants, and cover crops are also susceptible and can increase fungal survival and dispersal.
This is a soilborne fungus that infects trees through the roots. Microsclerotia in the soil germinate and infect roots. Once roots have become infected, the pathogen colonizes the xylem through mycelial growth and conidial production. Conidia are carried quickly through the sapstream thus spreading the infection throughout the plant. Eventually, conidia lodge and germinate, plugging the xylem and blocking water movement. This results in wilt symptoms. Xylem function is further compromised when the fungus produces toxins that kill nearby plant tissues leading to an intensification of wilt. Microsclerotia are formed in dying plant tissues. Wood chips from infected trees can transmit the disease as well as fallen leaves. Once in the soil they can survive for years.


","Symptoms initially appear as leaf wilting, chlorosis, and scorch. Affected branches may be scattered throughout the tree canopy or they may occur on only one side.  As symptoms progress, branch dieback occurs and entire branches may be killed. If infection is severe, the entire tree may wilt and suddenly die. Dead leaves either remain hanging on affected branches or defoliate soon after wilting. Often, dark brown-orangish streaks can be observed in the sapwood. Infected trees may die within a few weeks or live for years with a chronic reoccurrence of symptoms.


","

1) For landscape plants, prune off and burn affected limbs, preferably before leaves fall spreading new microsclerotia.

2) Clean pruning equipment after use.

3) Do not use wood chips from infected trees as mulch.

4) Keep nitrogenous fertilizers to a minimum-enough only to produce normal, not succulent growth.

5) If the tree dies and/or is removed, replace it with a nonsusceptible host such as any conifer, birch, dogwood, or sycamore.

6) Avoid planting maple in fields with a history of Verticillium wilt. Avoid fields previously planted in potato, tomato, peppermint, strawberry, and raspberry.

7) A preplant soil test for propagules will help determine a planting site. Infected plants have been found in fields with as few as 1 microsclerotia/gram of soil, thus any presence of  in a field is considered a risk.

8) For nursery stock, remove the entire infected plant, including root system, and burn.

","Preplant fumigation may be helpful for nursery production. Fungicides are not considered effective to cure infected trees.

Rhododendron,Cutting Rots,"Rhododendron and azaleas can be propagated by cutting a vegetative shoot from a stock or production plant, sticking it into growing media and allowing it to root under high moisture conditions (misting or enclosed in plastic) before growing on to a full salable plant. All too often the cuttings do not produce roots and subsequently rot. The OSU Plant Clinic has found several fungi involved with Rhododendron cutting rots including Rhizoctonia sp., Fusarium sp., and Cylindrocarpon sp. Some cutting rot samples also have no organisms involved. Foliar fungal pathogens, such as Pestalotiopsis sydowiana, can also complicate matters by colonizing leaves that are cut back to reduce transpiration.
Many of these are soilborne fungi that are favored by cool, wet soil and/or media. They can become a problem if growing media becomes contaminated or a pathogen is introduced on cuttings or in irrigation water. These fungi are able to survive for various periods as resting spores or as mycelium in soil and residual host tissues. They also can persist in old, reused containers and trays.
Management of Cylindrocladium blight by immersing azalea cuttings in a fungicide or disinfectant solution for several minutes was recommended for many years. Unfortunately, a few contaminated cuttings can contaminate the entire batch resulting in widespread disease and cutting failure. A similar situation can happen when dipping cuttings in rooting hormone. Again, if a contaminated cutting is dipped then all succeeding cuttings dipped into the same container/solution may become contaminated.
There are many reasons for cutting failure that can lead to pathogen colonization. Time and placement of shoots selected from the mother plant, excessive misting, wounded cuttings, dibble holes larger in diameter than the cutting, as well as wilted cuttings that do not hydrate are all factors. Cutting may wilt due to extended shipping or storage duration, cutting boxes that are not full, slow handling on the sticking line, delays in getting cuttings to the bench as well as dry, sunny or windy environments.


","Cuttings fail to root or even produce callus on the lower-cut end. Stems become water-soaked, turn brown and necrotic. The rot may be slimy or firm depending on the predominate organism involved. Once stems rot, the leaves may wilt, curl, or turn chlorotic (yellow) before becoming brown and necrotic then falling off. Leaves may also develop a brown necrosis starting at the leaf's cut edge indicating fungal infection of the leaf.


","

1) Use tissue cultured plants (if possible) to avoid the problem altogether.

2) Take cuttings from field plants above the splash zone. Rain and irrigation can splash soil particles as well as microorganisms onto plants.

3) Do not take cuttings from obviously or subtly diseased plants.

4) Take cuttings in the morning and/or after irrigation when they are more fully hydrated. Avoid hot weather.

5) Select cuttings from shoots without flower buds and/or lateral shoots. Lateral shoots generally are more rootable than terminals. Flower buds are generally inhibitive.

6) Use sharp tools to remove cuttings, buds or leaf tissue. Clean tools and soak in disinfectant. Use two tools so a worker can trim or cut with one while the other soaks. When done with a batch, cultivar, etc. switch one tool for the other and allow the used one to soak.

7) Saturate media 24 hours before sticking, it should be uniformly dark brown to black and shiny (although there is a lot of variation in color with different media).

8) Make bottom cuts through nodes to help stimulate meristematic activity. Make all cuts of stems or leaves with clean sharp tools.

9) Rub off indumentum on stems to improve contact with rooting media and tomentum on leaf surfaces to keep them dryer.

10) Disinfect the storage facility, before cuttings come in, with peroxides or quaternary ammonium products. Disinfect the sticking area before work begins and frequently while sticking. Disinfect carts, benches, and any containers that come in contact with cuttings. Clean the floors at least once a day.

11) Use disposable gloves and aprons for workers.

12) Use disposable containers for hormone and use a new container every time it needs to be refilled.

13) Match the dibble hole size to the stem diameter of the cutting.

14) Use as little misting as possible after sticking. Use only enough water to prevent cuttings from wilting. Mist should not wet the media until roots are formed. Adjust misting based on weather conditions such as sunny vs. cloudy weather. Some growers may wish to use spreader surfactants to better wet leaves but adjust misting accordingly.

15) Water cuttings after sticking and once on the bench. Maintain moderate media moisture while cuttings are forming callus. Start drying the media once callus has formed and reduce mist. Media should be light-brown in color but not dry. Once roots form, dry media a little more, but just enough to prevent wilting. Uniform moisture from top to bottom of media is important especially when bottom heat is used.

16) Careful and frequent scouting for problems. Remove and destroy any diseased cuttings.

Rhododendron,Gray Blight,"Pestalotiopsis sydowiana, a fungus. A minor problem in the field but potentially severe in propagation.

2) Do not take cuttings from infected plants.

3) Use a clean, sharp tool to remove leaf tissue on cuttings. Clean tools and soak in disinfectant. Use two tools so a worker can trim or cut with one while the other soaks. When done with a batch, cultivar, etc. switch one tool for the other and allow the used one to soak.

4) Space cuttings for good air circulation.

5) Use as little misting as possible after sticking. Use only enough water to prevent cuttings from wilting. Mist should not wet the media until roots are formed. Adjust misting based on weather conditions such as sunny vs. cloudy weather.

Rhododendron,Leaf and Flower Gall,,,,,
Rhododendron,Leaf Scorch,"Leaf scorch on rhododendrons is a response to stress. Water stress can occur under both extremes of flooded, overly-saturated soils or under drought conditions when too little water is present. Root or stem damage due to disease or transplant shock can also cause scorch symptoms. High soil pH and exposure to drying winds are other possible causes of leaf scorch. Too much salt in soil or irrigation water, or using large amounts of inorganic fertilizers, or a combination of all three can cause symptoms as well. Plants in containers or not receiving enough water are often salt damaged, which also predisposes them to other problems such as Phytophthora root rot.


","Symptoms include browning of tips or margins of leaves, with the damage sometimes spreading to the center of the leaf. The south/southwest side of the plant is the most likely to be damaged by direct sunlight, but plantings also might be damaged by reflected sunlight.


","

1) Correct alkaline soil pH by adding organic matter or sulfur to make it more acidic.

2) Provide adequate soil moisture by irrigation where dry soil is a problem.

3) Use raised beds or improve soil drainage with tiles if saturated soil is the problem.

4) Shelter susceptible plants from drying winds, either with other plantings or by planting near structures.

5) Use an appropriate amount of inorganic fertilizer.

6) Irrigate heavily on occasion to leach out excessive salts.

7) Check the salt content of your water source.

Rhododendron,Leaf Spots,"Phyllosticta spp., a fungus found on wild as well as cultivated rhododendron. It can enter through wounds. Six species have been reported in Washington. Cladosporium sp. have also been found frequently associated with leaf spots by the OSU Plant Clinic. Both fungi have been found when samples are sent in with concerns about Ramorum Leaf Blight. In addition there are many different fungi that have been found less frequently in association with leaf spots on rhododendron in the PNW.


","Spots are dark brown, zonate, and frequently cover half the leaf area. The spot's upper surface may feel bumpy due to the fungal fruiting bodies (pycnidia).


","

Rhododendron,Lime-induced Chlorosis,"A deficiency of some element, usually iron, in the plant. Iron may be lacking in the soil or in a form unavailable to plants. Lime-induced chlorosis, or leaf yellowing, is caused by strongly alkaline soil, which can make iron or manganese unavailable to plants. Rhododendrons grow normally in acidic soils.


","Leaves yellow, starting at the margin and progressing inward until, in severe cases, only the areas around larger veins remain green.


","Feeder roots are close to the surface, so work soil very lightly to avoid further injuring the plant.

1) Adjust soil pH to 4.5 to 6. Adding sulfur or organic matter, especially conifer needle mulch, which is highly acidic, may help.

2) Check plant's proximity to newly poured concrete. New concrete leaches lime into the surrounding soil, raising the pH.

3) Use iron chelate, either as a soil treatment or by foliar feeding, to quickly help chlorotic plants.

Rhododendron,Necrotic Ringspot,"A potexvirus, Rhododendron necrotic ringspot virus, has been associated with symptoms of this disease but has not been experimentally proved the cause. Transmission likely is by vegetative propagation, but other methods or vectors are unknown. Insect such as aphids are known to transmit other potex viruses. Pollen or seed may be a means of transmission because many seedlings have been reported with symptoms. Both evergreen Rhododendrons and Kalmia latifolia can be affected. The problem is widespread in the Pacific Northwest.


","Necrotic rings become apparent in 2-year-old leaves. Current-season growth and flowers are unaffected. Concentric rings become more numerous during the growing season. Leaves generally turn red or yellow and fall prematurely from the plant. Loss of plant vigor also has been reported. Amount of sunlight may be a factor in symptom development.


","

1) Remove and destroy symptomatic plants. Do not propagate from plants showing symptoms.

Rhododendron,Phytophthora Blight and Dieback,"Many different Phytophthora species, fungal-like microorganisms, can cause blights and dieback of Rhododendron alone without necessarily producing a root rot phase. Phytophthora syringae, is common during the cool winter months. P. plurivora is common during warmer months and is most active in summer. Phytophthora cactorum, P. citricola, P. parasitica, and P. heveae also can produce leaf spots and dieback and are also active in warm summer weather. Other species active in the PNW include P. gonapodyides and P. hibernalis. Also, P. ramorum is yet another species that can cause similar symptoms but is a quarantined pest. Not only can one find a different set of species at different times of the year, but different sets of species can also be found from nursery-to-nursery.
Rain-splashed or wind-blown inoculum begins the infection. A film of water is necessary for germination and infection. Container plants falling over into contaminated puddles can also start the process. Lower leaves seem to be more typically infected, as they are closer to inoculum sources. Leaf-to-leaf contact can also spread the disease. Young leaves are more susceptible than older leaves. Depending on the species involved, low temperatures and wounds can also favor disease development. Periods of leaf wetness and favorable temperatures encourage the production of sporangia in lesions, continuing the disease cycle. Healthy plants spaced close to infected plants can become infected by inoculum spread by rain or irrigation. Lower leaf surfaces are more susceptible to infection than upper surfaces, most likely due to stomata as infection courts. Oospores form in infected leaves and survive until the next rainy season. Survival is best when host tissue is kept moist and intact. Low-leaf nitrogen levels result in smaller leaf spots and less symptom development for several species.


","Leaf spots produced by P. syringae are irregular and necrotic and usually start on leaf edges or tips. Infected leaves usually fall off. Leaf spots by other species start out generally circular on young leaves as water-soaked lesions that then turn chocolate brown. Lesions expand leaving the central area dried out and brittle. Lesions may expand into and down the midrib and into the petiole. Lesions may appear wedge-shaped as they progress along the leaf. Necrosis may continue from the petiole into the stem resulting in a diamonded-shaped canker. Entire shoot tips may wilt and dieback. Young plants may die completely while older plants may survive for a few years. Branch cankers produced by P. syringae are shiny black but not sunken. Usually the tip dies back, and the branch defoliates.
Spots are easily confused with leaf scorch, chemical damage, or various mechanical injuries. Spotting symptoms due to various Phytophthora species are difficult to distinguish and are dependent on cultivar and temperature. Contact your Department of Agriculture for an accurate diagnosis if you see or suspect plants with symptoms caused by P. ramorum.


","Use many different tactics to manage these diseases but development of an appropriate water management plan is the best cultural practice.

1) Propagate cuttings only from plants known to be free of disease for several months. Use clean, pathogen-free potting media and clean, new pots.

2) Manage the application of irrigation water to reduce the length of time that foliage is wet. If possible, increase the interval between waterings. Use drip irrigation when practical.

3) Use only clean water for irrigation. Treat surface irrigation water to kill spores.

4) Provide good drainage for plants in beds, fields, or containers. Place containers on gravel beds (4 inches or more deep) or raised benches to allow drainage. Do not place containers on poly sheets; they can prevent containers from draining into soil and allow contaminated drainage water to spread from the base of one container to another. Improve drainage to avoid puddling and splashing in established areas.

5) Space plants out for good air circulation that promotes drying.

6) Prune off infected leaves and branches.

7) Rake up and destroy dead leaves around the base of plants.

8) Avoid reusing pots from a previous crop for propagation. If pots must be reused then wash off all debris and soak in a sanitizing solution or treat with aerated steam for 30 min.

9) Prevent potted plants in nurseries from falling over allowing foliage to touch the ground.

10) In the landscape, use a mulch layer of composted bark to help prevent rain or irrigation splash.

11) Use an appropriate amount of nitrogen fertility avoiding excess levels.

","Use before symptoms are expected to show. The Group 4 and Group 33 fungicides used to manage Phytophthora do not kill this organism. They can only prevent establishment of the organism before it gets into the plant. They can also prevent continued growth if the organism is already inside the plant thereby delaying symptoms that might have developed. Once chemical activity has subsided with time, the organism can resume growth within infected plants. Alternate or tank-mix products from different groups that have different modes of action.

Rhododendron,Phytophthora Root Rot,"Phytophthora cinnamomi, P. cactorum, and P. citricola, fungus-like microorganisms carried in plants, soil, or water. They have a wide host range, including azalea, mugo pine, Taxus (yew), and heather.
Poorly drained, waterlogged soil or media, plastic ground covers, or media favors these water-mold organisms. They survive unfavorable periods as oospores or chlamydospores in plant debris. These spores can persist several years. Long-distance movement of infected plants and/or soil can spread the microorganism, as well as contaminated plant debris, potting media, or water. Spores germinate and produce sporangia and a swimming spore stage called zoospores. Inoculum build up is greatest under saturated conditions. These spores are attracted to the fine roots where they attack and begin to rot the root system. After infection, the microorganism spreads, mainly in the inner bark tissues of the root and stems. Warm temperatures, as well as high water salinity or pH, favor disease development.
Hybrid cultivars that are resistant include 'Caroline', 'Serenade', 'Martha Isaacson', 'Pink Trumpet', 'Red Head', and 'Professor Hugo de Vries'. Rhododendron species that are resistant include R. davidsonianum, R. delavayi, R. glomeralatum, R. hyperethrum, R. lapponicum, R. occidentale, R. quinquefolium, R. sanctum, R. pseudochrysanthum, R. simsii, and R. websterianum.


","Fibrous roots turn necrotic brown and rot first, followed by much of the root system. Rot can continue from the roots up through the root crown to stems. When examining infected root systems, there is generally a lack of fine roots and larger roots are present but firm with various discolorations from black to dark brown. The edge of the advancing lesion is distinct from adjacent unaffected tissue. The infected root tissues in this area are generally dry with various shades of brown to reddish-brown or cinnamon colored while the healthy tissue is moist and light colored. Because roots and stems are rotted, leaves wilt and become yellowish-green. Leaves may show various nutrient deficiency symptoms. Finally the plant dies with dead leaves remaining attached to the plant. Sometimes new roots may be observed to regenerate near the root crown of the plant.


","Use many different tactics to manage root rots but focus efforts on water management.

1) Quarantine new plants at least 1 year before setting them out in the production area. Examine and destroy any plants that show disease.

2) Grow resistant cultivars and types.

3) Use pathogen-free cuttings.

4) Provide good drainage for plants in beds, fields, or containers. Place containers on gravel beds (4 inches or more deep) to allow drainage. Do not place containers on poly sheets; they can prevent containers from draining into soil and allow contaminated drainage water to spread from the base of one container to another.

5) Rapid drainage of container media throughout the production cycle of the crop is critical. Air-filled pore spaces of 15% for 4-inch high media (1 gal pots) and 20% to 35% for 7-inch high media (2.5 gal pots) is associated with fewer losses.

6) Use raised beds in landscape plantings.

7) Use care in watering. If using a hose, take care not to splash, and keep the nozzle and hose off the ground, walkways, or other surfaces that may be contaminated.

8) Keep benches and premises clean. Do not use sides of low benches as a footrest; soil on shoes may be contaminated. Keep walkways and areas beneath benches clean and free of plant debris.

9) Clean all propagating tools with disinfectants.

10) Use composted hardwood or conifer bark. The suppressive effect should last about 1 year at which time potted plants may be repotted into fresh media. Keep media on clean concrete pads and keep away from contaminated equipment or water.

11) Use clean irrigation water.

12) Reduce salinity of irrigation water.

13) Avoid reusing pots from a previous crop for propagation. If pots must be reused then wash off all debris and soak in a sanitizing solution or treat with aerated steam for 30 min.

14) Prevent potted plants in nurseries from falling over allowing foliage to touch the ground.

15) Low pH of the media (4 or lower) can suppress sporulation when propagating cuttings.

","Use fungicides as preventative treatments. Multiple applications may be needed in container production when media temperature is above 45°F. The Group 4 and Group 33 fungicides used to manage Phytophthora do not kill this organism. They can only prevent establishment of the organism before it gets into the plant.

Rhododendron,Powdery Mildew,"The fungus Erysiphe azaleae (formerly Microsphaera azaleae) is found throughout the Pacific Northwest on garden azalea and rhododendron species and hybrids. Erysiphe vaccinii (formerly Microsphaera vaccinii) has been found only on wild R. occidentale  growing on the southern Oregon coast. Disease symptoms have not been found on the other Northwest native species, R. albi-florum and R. macrophyllum.
These fungi are obligate parasites that produce two kinds of spores. Asexual conidia are most frequent; they spread by wind and produce new colonies, which produce more spores. Many infection cycles may occur in a summer. The disease develops late in summer, but overwintering colonies have been seen throughout the winter on leaves' undersides. Sexual spores are produced in small, black, spherical structures (chasmothecia). They are produced in fall in great numbers on azalea but are less frequent on evergreen rhododendrons. High humidity and low light intensity favors the disease. During the 1990s, growers reported more severe powdery mildew on cultivars, such as Virginia Richards, that normally were not attacked.


","Symptoms appear to be influenced more by cultivar than by environment. The most common symptoms are diffuse pale yellow spots on the leaf upper surface, usually from 0.25 to 1 inch in diameter. On the lower leaf surface are purple to brown, circular, diffuse feathery areas. Sometimes, a sparse fungal growth is within the spots. Other symptoms on the upper leaf surface include large purple-brown spots, or purple-brown areas associated with veins, or purple ringspots, or occasionally green spots as the remainder of the leaf yellows. Some cultivars such as Unique show no symptoms on the top of the leaf but have typical diffuse colored spots or a heavy powdery growth on the leaf's underside.
Necrotic, brown, sunken spots are not associated with this disease; they are caused by a number of other fungal and environmental factors. Severe defoliation can occur on some cultivars such as Virginia Richards and species such as R. campylocarpum and R. cinnabarinum. As leaves begin to defoliate, usually in fall or early spring, they can have various patterns of yellow, red, and brown. Other cultivars can tolerate considerable leaf spotting without much defoliation. Most azaleas and some evergreen rhododendrons (such as 'Purple Splendor' and 'Vulcan's Flame') have the typical white powdery growth on both sides of the leaf usually associated with powdery mildew.

Rhododendron,Ramorum Leaf Blight and Shoot Dieback,"A fungus-like organism, Phytophthora ramorum, was first reported to cause leaf blight, stem canker, and tip dieback on nursery-grown rhododendrons and viburnums in Germany and the Netherlands in 1993. At about the same time, many tanoaks (Notholithocarpus densiflorus), and oaks (Quercus spp.) in the San Francisco Bay Area were dying from this same pathogen. In Oregon, the organism was found killing wild rhododendrons in a few isolated sites just north of Brookings, OR during the summer of 2001. Federal and international quarantines have been established to prevent the spread of this pathogen in soil and infected plant material. Since the initial discovery, the disease is considered established and Oregon has focused on limiting spread in Curry County through early detection, monitoring, and eradication of symptomatic tanoak trees. Despite these efforts, the quarantine area in Curry County has expanded many times since 2001 from 9 sq. miles to over 500 sq. miles. The rate of disease spread increased most dramatically in 2014 requiring the quarantine area to nearly double in 2015.
In the spring of 2003, the disease was discovered in a wholesale nursery in Oregon and in Washington at a retail outlet. Each year the disease has been found in a few PNW nurseries based on extensive sampling by state departments of agriculture. The disease has not been found in any Christmas tree plantations in the PNW. In 2005 this became a federally quarantined pathogen. All nurseries exporting hosts/associated hosts must now participate in the federally mandated certification program to export product interstate and internationally.
The disease was also discovered in a botanical garden landscape on the north end of Bainbridge Island, WA in 2015. Several plants including were infected with the NA-1 clone including Camellia, Gaultheria, Mahonia, Pieris, Rhododendron, Vaccinium, Viburnum and Vinca. Although eradication was completed it is suspected that the pathogen will persist and efforts are focused on containment.


","Symptoms on rhododendrons are very similar to those caused by sunburn and other, foliar Phytophthora species. Leaf lesions penetrate through the plant tissue so that spots can be seen on both sides of the leaf. They can be triangular in shape and extend along the leaf petiole and midrib, or leaf spots can occur where water accumulates on the leaf margins. Leaf spots have diffuse margins and the appearance of watersoaking. Infections of both above- and belowground tissues may not produce symptoms making this a very difficult disease to detect.
In southern Oregon, tip dieback was observed where shoot tips became progressively necrotic. Leaves on these shoots may remain green for a while but the petiole becomes necrotic and eventually the whole leaf collapses once the stem is girdled. If left unchecked, the pathogen can kill rhododendrons, particularly if the apical bud is infected.
Symptoms on the other hosts are difficult to distinguish from those caused by other pathogens. If you suspect you have seen a P. ramorum-infected plant in Oregon, call the Invasive Species Hotline, 1-800-INVADER (1-800-468-2337).


","Management efforts in Pacific Northwest nurseries are focused on eradicating the pathogen where it is found and preventing new infections. Early detection is vital to preventing disease spread. Practices useful in managing other foliar Phytophthora diseases should also be helpful in protecting plants from infection by P. ramorum.

1) In Oregon, notify the ODA's Nursery and Christmas Tree Program Supervisor when importing nursery stock from any out-of-state source.

2) Purchase nursery plants only from nurseries certified as free from  according to federal regulatory standards. A certified nursery will have an official certification shield.

3) Shipments of known nursery hosts should be placed in an isolated area at least 7 ft from other plants and regularly observed or inspected for disease symptoms. This may take as long as 3 to 6 months for symptom suppressing chemicals to wear off or occurrence of favorable weather.

4) Contact your Department of Agriculture if you see or suspect plants with symptoms of this disease.

5) Do not transport firewood, other susceptible plant material, or soil from diseased areas in California or southwest Oregon.

6) Wash shoes, vehicles, bikes, etc. if you visit infested areas of California or southwest Oregon.

7) Propagate cuttings only from plants known to be free of disease for several months. Use clean, pathogen-free potting media and clean, new pots.

8) Manage the application of irrigation water to reduce the length of time that foliage is wet. If possible, increase the interval between waterings. Improve drainage to avoid puddling and splashing. Place pots on well-draining surfaces.

9) Use only clean water for irrigation. Treat irrigation water to kill spores of  and other  species. Remove and destroy any fallen leaf material, dead branches or plants.

10) Provide good drainage for plants in beds, fields, or containers. Place containers on gravel beds (4 inches or more deep) or raised benches to allow drainage. Do not place containers on poly sheets; they can prevent containers from draining into soil and allow contaminated drainage water to spread from the base of one container to another.

11) Remove and burn all leaves and branches of dead plants. Disinfest tools and shoes that may have been in contact with contaminated plants or potting media. Incinerate contaminated pots and trays or treat them with aerated steam (122°F for 30 min.) to kill the pathogen. Do not compost and reuse infected material.

","Use fungicides as general preventative treatments. If you actually find this disease in your nursery stock, your state department of agriculture will work with you to eradicate this quarantine pathogen. Most fungicides used to manage Phytophthora do not kill this organism. They can only prevent establishment of the organism before it gets into the plant. They can also prevent continued growth if the organism is already inside the plant thereby preventing the development of symptoms. Once chemical activity has subsided with time, the organism can resume growth within infected plants.
Resistance management through the use of tank-mixes or alternating products with different modes of activity will be very important. Limit the use of any one group during crop production.

Rhododendron,Rusts,"Chrysomyxa piperiana is probably the main species on native R. macrophyllum in Oregon and has the alternate host, Sitka spruce, which is reported in Oregon. The rust of cultivated rhododendrons is C. reticulata, a native North American rust that spread to nurseries from Ledum. Chrysomyxa spp. form spermagonia and aecia on Picea (spruce) and uredinia, telia and basidia on Rhododendron.  The fungus can overwinter on any indicated hosts. The disease is most often in plantings along the coast.
Aeciospores that form on Sitka spruce are distributed from current year needles to rhododendrons during summer and fall. Current year rhododendron leaves are infected but may not develop uredinia until the following spring. Urediniospores can reinfect healthy rhododendron leaves and keep the disease cycle going without the need for other spore stages. Urediniospores can cause new infections throughout the year under favorable environmental conditions. These spores are airborne and spread the fungus rapidly from plant to plant. Germination of these spores begins within several hours if the temperature is 15°C to 20°C, the relative humidity is high, and the light is low. If these spores are exposed to high temperature and high humidity, their survival time is shortened. Chrysomyxa rusts typically overwinter in leaves as dormant mycelium. Telia are produced in the early spring and germinate without a period of dormancy to produce basidiospores, which infect Sitka spruce.


","First, light-yellow or yellow-green spots on the upper leaf surface and brown to purple spots on the lower surface. Blisters form in this area of the lower leaf surface, and they rupture to expose typical yellow to orange-red pustules containing the urediniospores. This windborne spore reinfects only rhododendron. Several generations may develop during the growing season. Severe infections may cause defoliation. The disease usually appears in late summer and fall on the previous season's foliage. Secondary fungal invaders may opportunistically colonize these areas causing various necrotic leaf spots.


","

1) Collect and burn infected leaves.

2) Space plants for good air circulation and rapid drying.

","These fungicides should be applied on 7- to 14-day intervals in spring and/or summer to protect new foliage from urediniospores from infected rhododendrons or from aeciospores dispersed from conifer hosts.

Rhododendron,Sunburn,"A combination of sun exposure, air temperature above 90°F, and low available soil moisture in the root zone. Not all rhododendron cultivars take direct sun. The injury in itself is not serious, but it is unsightly and offers fungi and bacteria a place to enter and cause trouble. Frequently, saprophytic fungi develop in sunburned areas, which make it seem as if the basic problem is a fungus disease. Cultivars with heavy indumentum, a covering of fine hair on lower leaf surfaces, have less water loss during high heat periods and may not sunburn as much.


","Leaves of some cultivars often are injured in warm periods, and the center portion bleaches out to tan or off-white except near large veins. Damage is moist intense on the south or southwest side of plants. Exposure to sun just during the midday can also produce similar symptoms.


","

1) Move the plant to a more shaded location.

2) Provide some shade where it is now planted.

3) Maintain watering during summer.

",,
Rhododendron,Tissue Proliferation,"Unknown. A genetic change that occurs during tissue-culture propagation that predisposes plants to express symptoms when grown under accelerated growth conditions. The disease was a major problem for growers in the 1980's but with changes in production of tissue culture plants it has not been a problem for many years. Tissue proliferation has occurred on seedlings and on plants propagated by tissue culture and vegetative cutting. It is thought to be a genetic disorder that may be aggravated by some chemicals used in accelerated production (use of light-weight soilless media, high fertilizer, pesticides and growth regulators). Evidence indicates the crown gall bacterium is not involved. Field and grower observations are that the problem is not infectious and cannot be transmitted by graft. Tissue proliferation has been observed in North America as well as in Europe. Only a few rhododendron cultivars are affected, but different nurseries have trouble with different cultivars.


","Vascular tissue differentiation associated with tissue proliferation distinguishes it from wound callus and crown gall. Another characteristic is that many small shoots develop from the galled area. Crown gall is solid, looks somewhat uniform, and has malformed vascular tissue, but tissue proliferation has developed vascular connections. Tissue proliferation generally is at the plant's base but can be on shoots. It has not been seen on roots, another distinction from crown gall. The excessive tissue growth may deteriorate after several years of plant growth.
Plants appear healthy as a whole, and growth is not seriously affected. However, growers in some Eastern States have observed slow decline, wilting, and eventual death of affected plants. If tissue proliferation circles the stem of small or young plants, the plant may die due to the vascular system's disruption. Plants seem weakened at the proliferation site, so limbs on the stem may dislodge or break off easily.
This problem may be confused with witches' broom, which is characterized by several woody shoots arising from the bud near the terminal part of the plant. Gall-like growth is not associated with witches' broom.


","None known. Provide good, nonaccelerated cultural conditions for rhododendron production. Affected plants may be rogued if desired.

Rhododendron,Witches' Broom,"The fungi Exobasidium vaccinii and E. vaccinii-uliginosi have been reported from the Pacific Northwest. The cause in azalea is unknown.

Rhubarb ,(Rheum rhabarbarum)-Gray Mold,"Botrytis cinerea, a fungus that overwinters on decayed rhubarb plant parts. Spores also are abundant in the air and on decayed parts of many other plant species. The disease can be a problem in the field but is more destructive in forced crops.


","On older leaves and stems, a powdery gray mold develops under moist or humid conditions. During harvest, packing, and shipping, stems are further infected. Reddish brown, water-soaked areas develop on stems as the disease advances, producing additional gray mold spores. Especially under warm storage conditions, a watery decay may follow.

Rhubarb ,(Rheum rhabarbarum)-Leaf Spots,"Ascochyta rhei and Ramularia rhei, fungi that overwinter on old rhubarb leaves and stalks. These fungi also can spread through infected rootstock. Leaf spots are common on field-grown rhubarb west of the Cascade Range due to frequent rains in March and April when leaves and stalks are actively growing. Both pathogens produce spores that move by wind and splashing water. Ramularia rhei may also spread by use of infected root stock.


","Ascochyta infections appear as small, yellow-green infections on the upper leaf surface. Later, spots merge to give a mosaic appearance. The spots' centers turn white and fall out, giving the leaf a tattered appearance.
Ramularia leaf spots first appear as a small red dot and increases up to a 1-cm whitish-tan circular area with a purplish halo. Lesions on stalks tend to be more elongated, rather than circular.

Rhubarb ,(Rheum rhabarbarum)-Red Leaf,"The bacterium, Erwinia rhapontici (syn. = Bacterium rhapontici), can cause a crown rot of rhubarb, known as Red leaf or Bacterial soft rot. How the pathogen survives and is dispersed is not well understood. It is suspected that the disease may be spread by plant-feeding insects or by the use of infected root stock.


","A decay of the crown and terminal buds, brownish rot of pith tissues, and formation of cavities in the crown. A brownish rot begins just below a bud near soil level. Rot gradually extends to tissue above the infection point until it reaches the root's center. The entire plant crown can turn black, and cavities can form within infected crowns. The root's center may become hollow. In wet weather, decay sometimes extends up into the base of the stalk of older leaves. Leaves may be dull red or yellow, and stalks eventually collapse. Spindly side shoots may grow out, but usually they rot off. It may be several months after initial infection before aboveground symptoms are apparent.


","

",,
Rose ,(Rosa spp.) and hybrids-Armillaria Root Rot,"Armillaria mellea, a fungus, infects roots, killing the cambium and decaying the underlying xylem. Occasionally found on rose, this root pathogen is native to the Pacific Northwest where it occurs on the roots of many forest tree species, agronomic and ornamental hosts. The host range includes over 500 species of woody plants. The fungus spreads slowly, below ground, from root to root and can survive on woody host roots for long periods. When infected plants are removed, infected roots that remain below ground serve as a source of inoculum for other plants placed in the same location. Infection occurs when rose roots come in direct contact with partially decayed tree roots and are colonized by mycelium. Infection can also occur when roots contact rhizomorphs (black, shoestring-like fungal structures) that grow out from partially-decayed roots and through the soil.


","Aboveground symptoms are general and not specific. Diagnostic mycelial fans can be observed beneath the bark of the root crown of infected plants. Dig down about a foot below the soil line and use a pocketknife to remove thin layers of bark from the root collar. Mycelial fans are thick, white layers of fungus that adhere to the root bark and/or the wood beneath the bark. The fungus  also makes black, shoestring-like structures called rhizomorphs, which are occasionally found within the bark and/or extending into surrounding soil. Rhizomorphs may look like roots on the outside but have an entirely different structure when cut open in cross-section.


","

1) Roses that are vigorous, as a result of favorable climate and sound cultural practices, usually are more tolerant.

2) Water deeply when watering is needed. Avoid surface watering, especially wetting the crown and trunk root area. If using drip irrigation, move drip-line emitters away from the crown and in between plants.

3) Remove severely infected bushes and destroy them, being careful to remove small roots from the soil. Replant with resistant species (see the table ""Plants Resistant or Susceptible to Armillaria Root Rot,"" in Section 3).

4) Permanently removing soil around the crown and main root area has been effective in tree fruits grown in California and Australia and may be of benefit for managing infected bushes in the Pacific Northwest.

Rose ,(Rosa spp.) and hybrids-Bacterial Cane Blight,"An undetermined pathovar of Pseudomonas syringae, a bacterium.  This disease is different from the various symptoms on roses previously attributed to P. syringae and/or P. syringae pv. morsprunorum in the literature. An aggressive cane blight has been observed in the Treasure Valley of Idaho since 1996. Symptoms were common under cool, wet conditions in spring (March to May) and the level of incidence and severity of the disease varied from year to year. Several cultivars of climbing, floribunda, grandiflora, hybrid tea, hybrid perpetual, miniature and shrub roses can show severe symptoms.


","The symptoms usually started at the base of a vegetative bud or at leaf scars or wounds, as reddish-brown areas on the bark that later turn dark-purple-to-black and necrotic. The necrotic areas expanded around and along the cane, often involving a major part or even the entire cane. Vegetative buds on the affected parts of the cane turned brown and dried. The surface of the necrotic areas of the bark was glossy, and the tissue beneath the epidermis was brown to dark brown, and moist in the early stages. Often confused with winter injury.


","The following is suggested in the absence of specific research to control this problem.

1) Remove and destroy infected stems.

2) Disinfect pruning shears before cutting more stems.

","Spray before fall rains begin and again when half the leaves have fallen. Repeat in spring to protect new growth.

Rose ,(Rosa spp.) and hybrids-Black Mold,"Chlaropsis thielavioides (formerly Chalara thielavioides), a fungus. It grows on the ends of 'Manetti' cuttings (Rosa chinensis var. manetti) and on wounds left by disbudding, resulting in poor callus formation and, subsequently, poor root formation. It develops under bud shields on field-budded 'Manetti', thus preventing callus formation and causing the bud to die. The fungus also may damage rose roots if the plants are in storage too long before planting or if plants are overwatered after planting. The chief infection source is fungal spores in the dust and debris of storage houses where the plants are handled and cuttings prepared for planting.


","A white, granular, fungal growth that spreads rapidly over cut and bruised areas of stock and scion. Soon the growth turns black.

Rose ,(Rosa spp.) and hybrids-Black Spot,"Diplocarpon rosae, is a fungus that overwinters, or survives the cold season, on living or dead plant tissue that was infected in the previous growing season. Newly emerging leaves are most susceptible to this fungus. Spores produced on the old plant material are splashed on young plant tissue by winter and spring rains or by summer watering. After conidia land on a leaf, it takes at least 9 hours of leaf wetness for the spore to infect. In the Pacific Northwest, this moisture requirement is frequently and easily met.
Once the fungus is established in plant tissues, fungal fruiting bodies (acervuli) form in the spots in 11 to 30 days. A new crop of spores is produced and spreads to healthy portions of the plant. The cycle of infection is ready to begin again within 10 to 18 days. Conditions for growth and spread of the black spot fungus are most likely in spring and fall. However, rainy periods in any season encourage black spot, as long as the temperatures are between 50°F and 80°F.
Leaves infected with black spot produce the plant hormone ethylene. In leaves, high ethylene content leads to leaf drop. As a result, rose plants infected with black spot are defoliated early and look bare. Leaves may drop after only one or two lesions. Dropped leaves around the base of the plant then serve as a reservoir of fungal spores, reinfecting the plant during subsequent rains. Repeated defoliation leads to low vigor, inferior blooms, and high susceptibility to winter injury.
The natural genetic variability of the fungus means roses found resistant in one location may be susceptible in another location due to the presence of different fungal strains. Also, resistant roses may become susceptible after a few years due to changes in the local fungal population.


","Circular black spots, frequently with fringed (diffuse or feathery) margins, on the leaf. Yellowing and defoliation are common in susceptible cultivars. Bare stems with few leaves attached near the top is a frequent symptom. In wet weather, spots may become very severe and coalesce to make large irregular spots covering a third of the leaf surface. In cases of severe infections, similar appearing lesions also form on the stems. May be confused with other fungal leaf spotting diseases.


","

1) Plant cultivars known to be resistant in your area.  that the cultivar Carefree Spirit was the first landscape shrub to survive for 2 years in AARS tests without any fungicide and voted a winner.

2) Avoid dense plantings and shaded areas.

3) Avoid overhead watering that keeps plants wet for extended period of time.

4) Rake up and burn all leaves in a rose planting at season's end.

5) Prune canes back to two buds if canes are infected. Remove and destroy diseased canes before bud break.

","Focus applications at the beginning of the season starting at bud break. Apply frequently in wet spring weather and occasionally in summer (1- to 2-week intervals). May be very difficult to manage once the disease gets started. Almost every fungicide on the market is registered for this disease on this crop but only one or two materials are needed at any one time. Alternate or tank-mix materials with different modes of action to prevent developing resistant fungal populations. Some materials such as the Group 11 fungicides will not allow more than two (2) sequential applications.
Research in Alabama indicates that monthly dormant-season applications of Group 3 fungicides may help reduce or delay onset of this disease.

Rose ,(Rosa spp.) and hybrids-Botrytis Bud and Twig Blight,"Botrytis cinerea, a fungus that is ubiquitous and survives well as a saprophyte on dead plant debris as mycelium or sclerotia. Conidia from these sources or from active infections initiate infections.Common entry points include pruning wounds including those from normal winter pruning and removing spent flowers. Buds, flowers, leaves, and stems can be infected directly when the fungus produces enzymes that degrade components of the cuticle. Healthy tissue can become infected through weakened or dead tissues that are colonized by the fungus. It may also be a secondary invader attacking plants already infected with another pathogen.
A moist, humid environment is ideal for pathogen sporulation and spread. Spore dispersal is stimulated by changes in relative humidity. Concentrations peak in the greenhouse during irrigating, spraying pesticides, harvest, and shipping. Often the infection is imperceptible when cutting and packing flowers, however, moist conditions that occur during transport and/or storage favor disease development. Frost and cold injury to canes and buds contributes to disease development.
Bareroot nursery stock held in moist, cold storage conditions also can develop Botrytis blight on canes and roots.


","Infected buds may fail to open, droop, and develop smooth, slightly sunken, grayish-black lesions. A grayish-brown mycelial growth may develop on the entire bud and extend into the stem. Petal tips may become brown; or numerous small flecks, circular brown spots, or blister-like patches may appear on petals. Infected stubs or pruning wounds will develop into cane blights or cankers. Canes may be girdled, causing stem collapse.


","

1) Collect and destroy infected plant debris and tissues from and around the plant.

2) Reduce greenhouse moisture by raising the temperature, venting and/or increasing air circulation.

3) Space plants for adequate air movement.

4) Use drip rather than overhead irrigation.

5) Use calcium nitrate, gypsum, or similar calcium source topdressed or incorporated into container media.

","Use as a foliar spray, but focus on cultural controls. Alternate or tank-mix materials with different modes of action to prevent developing resistant fungal populations. Good to mix or alternate with FRAC group M3 or M5 fungicides.

Rose ,(Rosa spp.) and hybrids-Brand and Common Canker,"Two fungi. Coniothyrium wernsdorffiae causes brand canker, and Paraconiothyrium fuckelii (formerly Coniothyrium fuckelii) causes common canker. Both infect cane wounds caused by pruning, harvesting, insects, thorn scars, or scratches. Contaminated cutting knives, scissors, or pruners are a major source of the pathogen. Cool winter temperatures and winter coverings that keep canes moist favor brand canker. Common canker is favored by improper pruning, especially leaving long stubs above the last node. Common canker lesions developed more rapidly on young succulent stems than on older canes. High nitrogen fertility also increased common canker size.


","The diseases are easily confused. Both start out as discolored (yellow to red) spots that gradually enlarge with the center turning light brown. In cut-flower production, the cut stem turns yellow-to-black as the pathogen advances into the tissue. Brand canker develops a reddish-brown or purple margin that contrasts sharply with the normal green rose cane. Common canker has a darker brown margin and generally develops at the cane's cut end. Both cankers develop small black fruiting bodies (pycnidia) toward the center of damaged tissue. Brand canker that develops under the snow line will at first in spring be black, but then it develops as described above after being uncovered several weeks. Cankers may girdle stems, causing stems and shoots above that point to wilt and die. The disease is easily confused with Brown Canker.


","

1) Avoid injuring canes.

2) Prune canes with disinfected, sharp knife or pruner immediately above a node. Avoid leaving long stubs above a node.

3) Frequently clean and disinfect cutting tools.

4) Cut and destroy infected canes well below the affected area.

5) Use a winter protecting mulch that does not hold much water such as sand, rock pumice, or coarse bark.

6) Use a balanced fertilizer with moderate nitrogen.

","Usually unnecessary if cultural controls are used. Ineffective once canker symptoms are seen.


",
Rose ,(Rosa spp.) and hybrids-Brown Canker,"The fungus Cryptosporella umbrina has been reported only from Idaho. The disease is more common in the Southeastern United States. High moisture environments (such as hilling for winter protection) favor the disease. Spores can penetrate uninjured tissue. Lesion can form after 10 days under favorable conditions.


","Small red-to-purple spots appear on current season canes. Spots enlarge into whitish necrotic lesions with reddish-purple borders during the winter months. Cankers may coalesce and can be several inches long. Small black pycnidia can be seen in the cankered area. Cankers can wilt and kill distal portions of the cane. Easily confused with other canker diseases such as Brand or Common Canker.


","

1) Prune canes with a sharp knife or pruner immediately above a node when first symptoms are noticed.

2) Remove and destroy canes before sporulation occurs.

3) Use a winter protecting mulch that does not hold much water such as sand, rock pumice, or coarse bark.

","Usually unnecessary if cultural controls are used. Ineffective once canker symptoms are seen.

Rose ,(Rosa spp.) and hybrids-Bullhead,"A physiologic problem when temperatures drop into the 50s during early flower development. During this time there are major changes in the balance of different growth regulators present within the flowers. Prevalent in the cultivars Baccara and Talisman and those in the Columbia family of roses. The plant is not permanently affected.


","Buds have a flat-topped appearance instead of the pointed tip normally preferred. Flower buds are larger in size and weight, have many short petals and petaloids, and have a profusion of secondary florets bearing carpels near the base of the flower.


","Cut off damaged flowers to promote new canes with normal flowers.

",,
Rose ,(Rosa spp.) and hybrids-Chemical Injury,"There are a number of herbicides available for use around roses plantings. The herbicide class and the dosage to the plant determine which symptoms appear and their severity. Injury from glyphosate (such as Roundup and related materials) is relatively common. Damage symptoms caused by this herbicide may not appear during the season of application, especially if application is made in autumn, but symptoms may appear the following spring. The plant will outgrow the injury if the dosage was not too high. Glyphosate can be absorbed through green wood of canes, so care must be taken to avoid accidental application or drift.
Some chemicals used to manage common disease, such as black spot, powdery mildew, or rust, may cause various leaf or petal spots or discoloration. Abiotic leaf spots due to many different situations, including chemicals, are a common problem sent into the OSU Plant Clinic. Always watch for warnings on labels of various products.


","Herbicide damage may appear as a variety of symptoms, including cupped, curled, or chlorotic leaves, small leaves, or necrosis of the entire plant. Injury from glyphosate in the current season may appear as bright yellow leaves on the newest growth. Symptoms may not appear until the next growing season and may appear as a proliferation of small shoots and leaves from buds. New leaves in these nodes may look needle-like and blossoms may be underdeveloped.


","Avoid applications of herbicides in close proximity to rose plants. Never spray herbicides directly onto rose plants or let spray drift on to plants.

Rose ,(Rosa spp.) and hybrids-Crown Gall,"The bacterium Rhizobium radiobacter (formerly Agrobacterium tumefaciens) enters plants through wounds, either natural or caused by pruning, grafting, mechanical injury from cultivation, heaving of frozen soils, chewing insects, or the emergence of lateral roots. Systemic populations that initiate disease are as important in rose as they are in grape and walnut. After the bacterium enters a wound, a small piece of its DNA is transferred into the plant's DNA. The foreign DNA transforms normal plant cells in the wounded area into tumor cells. Once transformed, tumor cells proliferate automatically. The result is a gall: a disorganized mass of hyperplastic and hypertrophic tissue.
Pruning tools that cut through galls can become contaminated with the bacteria and spread them to cut surfaces of subsequently pruned plants. Galls breaking down in soil release bacteria, which can be transported by moving soil or water. In the absence of plant roots, bacterial populations gradually decrease; however, the pathogen may survive in soil for as long as 3 years. Many plants in 90 families are susceptible but woody perennials such as stone and pome fruit, caneberries (such as blackberry and raspberry), euonymus, Photinia, poplar, rose, walnut, and willow are typically infected.


","Galls are often at or just below the soil surface in the basal or root crown region. They may frequently be on roots, less frequently on aerial plant parts. Galls are usually rounded with a rough, irregular surface. They first appear as small protuberances on the plant surface. Young, actively developing galls are light green or nearly white, and the tissue is soft. As they age, galls become dark and woody. Outer portions can slough off with age. Sometimes galls have a rather smooth surface, which makes it difficult to distinguish between gall and callus growth, especially if the gall is at the plant base or at the graft or bud union. Plants can be stunted and have reduced vigor, poor foliage, and fewer blossoms. A single gall at the plant's base may be more detrimental than several galls on canes and roots. Symptoms may not develop for over a year if infection occurs when temperatures are below 59°F.


","

1) Use only pathogen-free nursery stock. Inspect new plants; do not plant any rose that has galls.

2) Avoid wounding plants, especially at planting. If root pruning at planting, soak in biocontrol agent listed below.

3) Use plants with resistant rootstocks. Rootstocks differ widely in susceptibility.

4) Prune off any galls on aerial parts of the plant.

5) Disinfect pruning shears frequently. Clean shears and long soak times improve the disinfectant's efficacy. Disinfestants include bleach, peroxides, and quaternary ammonium products.

6) Remove and destroy any affected plants.

7) Preplant soil solarization has been helpful in reducing populations of certain soilborne pathogens and weeds in western Oregon. Place clear plastic (preferably anti-condensation film) directly on smooth, rototilled ground, which has been irrigated to field capacity and then allowed to drain for 1-2 days. Bury the edges of the plastic to trap the heat. Solarize for 4-6 weeks (or longer) during the hottest part of the summer, beginning in early- to mid-July.The technique may help after removing diseased plants from a bed in which roses will be planted again.

1) Ferti-lome Fire Blight Spray (streptomycin) at 2 Tbsp/2.5 gal water. Soak root system and cut surfaces for 15 min. in this solution. This works better as a wound protectant than as a cure. Cutting away galls, as label directs, may help, but all galled tissue must be removed. Getting a new, pathogen-free plant will work better. Foliar sprays, as label directs, are not recommended.

1) Gallex (ready to use) painted on very young galls to reduce further development. Galls may return the following year or, if treated late, may continue to develop. Tissue surrounding the gall may be injured, especially on younger plants. Prepare the surface by removing soil from around the galled area, and allow the area to dry before application. . 24-hr reentry.

","Agrobacterium radiobacter strain 84 has been used successfully with roses in Australia, New Zealand, and Spain but has not been effective in limited trials in the United States. Strain K 84 is preventive only. Latent infections (symptomless) and existing galls are not controlled. A suspension of strain 84 may be used as a soak or spray. Thoroughly cover grafting wood, roots, and crown. Spray to runoff. To be effective, it must be applied a few hours after wounding.

"
Rose ,(Rosa spp.) and hybrids-Downy Mildew,"Peronospora sparsa, a fungus-like organism that can be systemic in roses. It overwinters as mycelium in stems, root crowns and roots or as oospores in leaf debris and stems. Humidity above 85% and cool temperatures favor the disease. Infection usually occurs on young plant parts. Cuttings taken from infected stock plants will carry the disease. Infected stock may or may not show symptoms. Excess nitrogen favors disease development.
Cross inoculations with isolates from either rose or Rubus sp. show they can infect the other host.


","Purplish-red to dark-brown, irregular spots on leaves. Leaflets may yellow but contain ""green island"" areas. Major leaf veins often restrict fungal growth such that lesions become angular as they enlarge. A grayish spore mass may be on the leaf underside if humidity persists. However, the diagnostic sporulation of this fungus is not abundant. Defoliation also may occur in extreme cases. Small spots or long purplish areas may form on canes and may kill twigs. Some people may confuse this with black spot or even rust. In the early stages, it may get confused with nutrient deficiency or spray injury.


","

1) Lower humidity in the greenhouse by raising temperatures and venting at key times of day.

2) Space plants for better air flow and reduced humidity.

3) Rake leaves and prune out old flowers and stems. Burn or bury them or send them to a landfill.

4) Take cuttings from plants with no history of the disease.

5) Scout plants carefully for symptoms of the disease especially the undersides of leaves and any stock plants or plants held over from the previous year.

6) Remove and destroy any tissue with symptoms of the disease. Entire leaves should be removed even if one leaflet has symptoms.

7) Isolate new plants and observe for symptoms prior to integrating into your plantings.

8) Although hot water soaks have been effective they have also damaged cuttings. Hot water soaks are not recommended until time and temperature durations have been investigated.

9) Maintain adequate, not excessive, fertility. Silicon applications have been found to help strengthen tissue and minimize tissue damage in Columbia.

","Focus on cultural control methods first. Do not use mefenoxam-based products (Group 4 fungicides) alone; may not offer much control, and encourage resistance to develop. Chemical control tactics help prevent infection but may not be helpful once the disease starts. Alternate or tank-mix products from different groups that have different modes of action. Limit the use of any one group during crop production.

Rose ,"(Rosa spp.) and hybrids-Leaf Spots, Miscellaneous","Several fungal leaf spots have been reported from the PNW. Cercospora leaf spot caused by Passalora rosicola (formerly Mycosphaerella rosicola) has been reported in Washington. It has become more important in the Southeastern United States as black spot resistant but Cercospora-susceptible roses become more widely planted. Damage appears to be greater on shrub and ground cover roses compared with hybrid tea and grandiflora roses. Spores produced in the spots are rain splashed to healthy foliage. Rainy weather favors the disease.
Spot anthracnose caused by Elsinoe rosarum has been reported from both Oregon and Washington. The fungus overwinters on infected leaves and stems with conidia continuously being formed in spring and early summer. Spore dispersal primarily occurs with the aid of water through rain and irrigation. There were 5 races of the fungus identified in Germany.
Cladosporium herbarum has also been reported from leaf spots in Washington.
Abiotic leaf spots due to many different situations, including chemicals, are a common problem sent into the OSU Plant Clinic. Some chemicals used to manage common disease, such as black spot, powdery mildew, or rust, may cause various leaf or petal spots or discoloration. Always watch for warnings on labels of various products.


","Cercospora leaf spot - Numerous tiny maroon-to-purple oval lesions develop randomly across the leaf surface. The center of these spots then turn tan-to-gray while the margin of the spot remains maroon-to-dark-purple. Heavily spotted leaves turn yellow and are prematurely shed. Typically, leaf loss begins at the base of the canes and gradually spreads upwards through the plant canopy towards the shoot tips. Leaves are most often infected but stems, pedicels, fruits, and bracts can also have symptoms.
Spot anthracnose - at first, the appearance of red spots that vary from brown or dark-purple on the upper leaf surfaces occurs. Small spots may be scattered or grouped and sometimes overlapping. Chlorosis or yellowing of the leaves may also occur. Later, spots become ashen-white with a dark-red margin. This tissue may fall off of the lower leaf surface, leaving a thin papery membrane or fall out entirely resulting in a shothole symptom. Symptoms occur on stems, hips, and pedicels as well as leaves.


","In general, tactics used to manage black spot, powdery mildew, and/or rust will be effective on many leaf spotting fungi.

1) Space or prune bushes to allow for good airflow. Avoid dense plantings and shaded areas.

2) Avoid overhead watering that keeps plants wet for extended periods of time.

3) Rake up and burn all leaves at season's end.

4) Remove and destroy infected plant parts.

Rose ,(Rosa spp.) and hybrids-Lime-induced Chlorosis,"Lime-induced chlorosis, or leaf yellowing, is caused by alkaline soil conditions. High (pH) alkalinity of soils can make iron or manganese unavailable to plants, causing leaf chlorosis. Has been more common in samples from eastern Oregon.


","The initial symptom is an interveinal chlorosis of the young leaves with the main veins remaining green. These leaves may remain small and become pale yellow to white.


","

1) Reduce soil pH by adding sulfur or organic matter, especially conifer needle mulch, which is highly acidic.

2) Check plant's proximity to newly poured concrete. New concrete leaches lime into the surrounding soil, raising the pH.

3) Use iron chelate, either as a soil treatment or by foliar feeding, to help chlorotic plants quickly. Read and follow all label instructions.

Rose ,(Rosa spp.) and hybrids-Nematodes,"Nematodes are a big problem in the production areas of California but have not been investigated as a problem in the Pacific Northwest. Soil types, that are more sandy, generally result in more nematode injury at lower population levels. Host ranges are wide for many of these nematodes making crop rotation impractical.

Rose ,(Rosa spp.) and hybrids-Phytophthora Root Rot,,,,,
Rose ,(Rosa spp.) and hybrids-Powdery Mildew,"Podosphaera pannosa (formerly Sphaerotheca pannosa), a fungus that overwinters in infected buds, rose leaves, twigs and branches. Infected buds grow in spring but are stunted and white with fungal conidia. Conidia are released in response to abrupt decreases in relative humidity. Wind blows conidia to healthy foliage where they start new mildew colonies. Germination and growth of conidia happen most readily on nights with high humidity or heavy dew and at temperatures near 70°F. Too much water, such as flowing water or rain, destroys spores by causing them to burst. The fungus does not grow in a leaf but rather across the surface. Small anchor cells of the fungus, haustoria, remain in the leaf and take nourishment from the rose plant, but the main filament and the multitudes of spores it produces are outside the leaf. Newly unfurled leaves are more susceptible to infection than mature leaves. Increasing day lengths to 20 to 22 hours were shown to reduce conidial production on greenhouse roses while maintaining postharvest quality. Brief exposure to red light during the dark period may also do the same.
Small, black fruiting structures (chasmothecia) also allow the fungus to overwinter on plant parts and debris. Ascospores from chasmothecia initiate new infections in spring. The disease can develop under relatively dry conditions in spring and summer so long as the air is humid. Plants in shade tend to have more problems because that environment favors disease development. Multiple disease cycles occur during the growing season. Climbers, ramblers, and hybrid teas are susceptible.
The natural genetic variability of the fungus means roses found resistant in one location may be susceptible in another due to the presence of different fungal strains. Also, resistant roses may become susceptible after a few years due to changes in the local fungal population.


","White, powdery, fungus growth on young leaves, shoots, and buds. When scouting, check on the underside of leaves, with good lighting conditions, as this is where it may first start. Distorted growth is common especially if young tissues are infected. If the disease is severe, foliage is stunted.


","

1) Plant cultivars known to be powdery-mildew-resistant in your area. Note that the cultivar Carefree Spirit was the first landscape shrub to survive for 2 years in AARS tests without any fungicide and voted a winner.

2) Isolate susceptible cultivars.

3) Space plantings for good air circulation between plants.

4) Prune canes when dormant, and destroy diseased canes.

5) Rake and destroy fallen leaves.

6) Use a high-pressure water hose to thoroughly wet all leaf and cane surfaces in the early afternoon so plants dry quickly. May need to do this two or three (3) times a week. In western Oregon, this reduced but did not eliminate powdery mildew.

7) Briefly expose plants to red light during the dark interval has some utility in greenhouse production.

","Applying a dormant spray of lime sulfur at one part lime sulfur to nine parts water may help a planting that had severe powdery mildew the year before. Apply foliar fungicides during the growing season, starting in early spring when young growth first appears. May need frequent applications, depending on the fungicide, to control the disease. For westside plantings, focus applications when weather becomes less rainy. Almost every fungicide on the market is registered for this disease on this crop but only one or two materials are needed at any one time. Alternate or tank-mix products with different modes of action to prevent buildup of resistant fungal populations. Limit the use of any one group during crop production.

Rose ,(Rosa spp.) and hybrids-Replant Disease,,,,,
Rose ,(Rosa spp.) and hybrids-Rose Mosaic,"Several viruses are associated with the range of symptoms of rose mosaic, including Prunus necrotic ringspot virus (PNRSV), Apple mosaic virus (ApMV), Arabis mosaic virus (ArMV), and Strawberry latent ringspot virus (SLRSV). The disease does not spread naturally and has no known insect vector, but grafting transfers it to healthy plants. Transmission of ArMV and/or SLRSV could occur by Dagger nematodes but this has not been extensively studied. Viruses can be in the rootstock or scion or both and may not show symptoms. 'Madame Butterfly', 'Ophelia', and 'Rapture' are highly susceptible. Some report the disease does not spread; others indicate it may spread very slowly over many years. Root grafting between infected and healthy plants can also spread the disease. Cuttings from virus-infected mother plants had 35% reduction in rooting.


","Symptoms may range widely depending on time of year, temperature, and type of virus(es) infecting the plant. Characteristic symptoms include chlorotic line patterns (zigzag pattern), ringspots, and mottles in leaves sometime in the growing season. There may also be yellow net and yellow mosaic symptoms. Symptoms often are evident in spring and early summer but may not be on leaves produced in summer. Vein-banding may be on leaves in long hot periods. Flower distortion, reduction in flower production, flower size, stem caliper at the graft union, winter survival, and early leaf drop, and increase susceptibility to cold injury have all been reported. Some infected cultivars may not show any symptoms at all.


","

1) Purchase stock that is clean and/or certified as tested and free of all known viruses.

2) Remove and destroy infected plants. However, the disease will not spread unless you propagate from or onto an infected bush.

3) Heat-treat scion stock plants 4 weeks at 100°F before grafting.

Rose ,(Rosa spp.) and hybrids-Rust,"Phragmidium sp., nine species of autoecious (can complete their life cycle on this one host) fungi that are found throughout the Pacific Northwest. They overwinter on diseased leaves and stems. Wind blows spores to healthy foliage. They germinate and infect through the stomata when leaves are wet for 2 to 4 hours. Mild, humid weather favors disease development.


","Small orange pustules (aecia) appear early in spring on both leaf surfaces. Later, the pustules enlarge and become more numerous on lower leaf surfaces. Mottled and chlorotic areas may develop on upper leaf surfaces opposite the spots (uredinia) on the lower surfaces. In late summer and fall, the small pustules turn black (telia) and contain the winter spore stages of the rust. Stems occasionally are infected.


","

1) Rake up all dead leaves and prune out infected and dead wood during the dormant season.

2) Plant resistant cultivars.

3) Removing infected leaves early in the season may be effective in some home gardens.

","Focus applications during the spring when mostly wet weather transitions into mostly dry weather. Wetting agents will help with many of these fungicides if allowed by the label. Many fungicides used for black spot will be helpful to control rust.

Rose ,(Rosa spp.) and hybrids-Verticillium Wilt,"Verticillium dahliae, a fungus that lives a long time in soil and can infect a wide range of hosts. Rootstocks such as Rosa odorata and 'Ragged Robin' are susceptible; R. multiflora and 'Dr. Huey' have more resistance. R. chinensis var. manetti is very resistant. Under favorable growing conditions plants may be able to tolerate infection.
The fungus grows into the xylem where it colonizes the plant through mycelial growth and conidial production. Fluid movement in the xylem passively transports the conidia. Once in the xylem, this fungus partially blocks water movement and produces toxins that result in wilt symptoms. Wilting occurs under periods of water stress such as mid-summer heat and drought. After diseased plant parts die, microsclerotia form and live several years in soil. Many weeds are susceptible and can help the fungus survive and disperse.


","At first, leaves near the growing point of young canes wilt, and lower leaves yellow. Sometimes mature leaves become necrotic between veins while the veins remain green. Defoliation progresses from the base of canes to the tip. Permanent wilt, defoliation, and death also may occur. If only a few canes are infected, they may grow normally next season or die back. Symptoms generally are more severe in the greenhouse than in the field. The characteristic vascular discoloration in other plants is not evident in rose.


","

1) Use resistant rootstocks.

2) Avoid planting in old vegetable gardens.

3) In the greenhouse, use steam-sterilized soil or use a sterile soilless potting mix.

4) Remove and destroy symptomatic or dead branches preferably before leaves fall and thus before new inoculum gets incorporated into the ground.

5) Clean pruning equipment after use.

6) Mulch with conifer-based products as conifers are resistant to infection. General yard waste mulch could contain infected plants and thus inoculum of the fungus.

Rose ,(Rosa spp.) and hybrids-Virus Diseases,"Several virus or virus-like diseases have been reported on the West Coast including Rose mosaic, Rose rosette virus, Rose spring dwarf-associated virus, Rose leaf curl virus, and Rose yellow mosaic virus. Rose mosaic is the most common virus disease. All are easily transmitted through vegetative propagation techniques.
Rose rosette virus, transmitted by a mite, was used as a biocontrol for troublesome wild hedges of Rosa multiflora in the Midwest. It is now widespread east of the Rocky Mountains. All cultivated roses (shrub type, hybrid tea, floribunda, grandiflora and miniature roses) are thought to be susceptible to the disease. The ""Knock Out"" rose cultivars are susceptible to rose rosette but just as much as other types.
Rose spring dwarf-associated virus has been found in aphids on affected plants but is not know if they are a vector of the disease or not.
Rose yellow mosaic virus (RoYMV) is a Potyvirus, which are known to be aphid-transmitted.


","Rose mosaic-chlorotic line patterns (zigzag pattern), ringspots, and mottles in leaves sometime in the growing season. There may also be yellow net and yellow mosaic symptoms.
Rose rosette-leaflet distortion and wrinkling, bright red leaf pigmentation, witches' broom, and phyllody. Plants are excessively thorny and eventually die. Infection can resemble glyphosate injury.
Rose spring dwarf-a rosetting or balling of new growth. Leaves are curved, very short, and show vein clearing or a netted pattern. Leaves occur on arrested shoots, which may not elongate for several months. Canes may grow in a zig-zag pattern during the growing season.
Rose leaf curl-spring leaves are small, leaflets detach easily, leaf epinasty, necrosis of shoot tips, and yellow vein flecking. Shoots are pointed with a broad base. Plants may recover in summer but show symptoms again in fall.
Symptoms associated with RoYMV infection included yellow mosaic, ring mosaic, premature leaf senescence, and necrotic dark-brown ring on canes. Symptoms first appeared in new growth 4 to 6 weeks post-inoculation. Necrotic cane symptoms were observed only in the cultivar Ballerina. Symptoms persist throughout the season.

Rose ,(Rosa spp.) and hybrids-Winter Injury,"Cold and dry wind can kill the scion of a dormant rose. Plants fertilized late in the year may continue lush growth into fall and early winter and are more susceptible to winter injury. Some cultivars are not adapted to colder regions or higher elevations.


","Buds may fail to break open in spring or may wilt and collapse shortly after emerging. In severe cases, canes turn black or deep purple. Rootstocks may survive and emerge at or below the ground level later than other roses. The rootstock will tend to have leggy growth, thin canes, and small, numerous flowers.


","

1) Do not fertilize late in the growing season.

2) Chose a cultivar adapted to your growth zone.

3) After fall pruning, use a mulch that does not hold water.

1) Good drainage is essential in pots or the landscape.

2) Water and fertilize lightly.

3) Remove all dead and dying plant parts on and around plants and take them out of the greenhouse. Many growers use closed containers to minimize the amount of conidia.

4) Maintain a steady, relatively dry environment by keeping greenhouse humidity below 90%, increasing spacing between plants for good air circulation, and taking care not to splash water on foliage during watering.

5) Place fans in greenhouse to get better air circulation.

Rosemary ,(Rosmarinus officinalis)-Root Rot,"Several root rotting organisms have been detected in rosemary root rot samples coming to the OSU Plant Clinic. Pythium, Thielaviopsis basicola (black root rot), and Rhizoctonia are among the organisms found. Rosemary is native to seaside cliffs and thus over watering and too much fertility inhibit good growth. These same soil conditions favor many root-rot organisms.


","Root or root crown rots result in the yellowing and dying of leaves. Whole branches or plants may become brown. Leaf tips may also become dark brown.
Roots affected by black root rot will initially be brown and could be mistaken for Rhizoctonia root rot. The diagnostic: flat, black root lesions occur when spores form on the root surface and in the root cortex.
Root systems affected by Pythium are dark brown and this symptom may extend up into the root crown and stems.


","

1) Good drainage is essential in pots or the landscape.

2) Water and fertilize lightly.

3) Use new trays and pots with clean soilless media. If pots must be reused then wash off all debris and soak in a sanitizing solution or treat with aerated steam for 30 min.

4) Preplant soil solarization has been helpful in reducing populations of certain soilborne pathogens and weeds in western Oregon. Place clear plastic (preferably anti-condensation film) directly on smooth, rototilled ground, which has been irrigated to field capacity and then allowed to drain for 1-2 days. Bury the edges of the plastic to trap the heat. Solarize for 4-6 weeks (or longer) during the hottest part of the summer, beginning in early- to mid-July.

Salal ,(Gaultheria shallon)-Leaf Spots,"Many fungi are reported including Dasyschypha sp.,  Phyllosticta pyrolae, and Pestalopezia sp. The OSU Plant Clinic has identified Phyllosticta sp. most often. Phyllosticta pyrolae and P. vaccinii (as well as many other fungi) were most frequently  isolated from healthy leaves collected from western Oregon.  Elsinoe ledi will cause a disease called spot anthracnose.
A survey of the fungi associated with severe leaf spots on salal growing on southern Vancouver Island, BC found Alternaria sp., Monochaetia sp., Pestalotiopsis spp., Phoma sp., Phomopsis sp., Phyllosticta pyrolae, and Valdensia heterodoxa (formerly  Valdensinia heterodoxa) as the most common.
Most fungal leaf spots are favored by wet weather that keeps leaves wet for extended periods of time. They generally survive unfavorable conditions in plant debris.


","Phyllosticta leaf spots are nearly circular and brown with pale centers. Spots may start as a small water-soaked or  pinhead-size spot. Generally, spots are only a few millimeters wide in nature but can enlarge and coalesce in cold storage. Small, black, fruiting bodies (pycnidia) develop in the spots' centers. Can also produce a stem lesion.
Spot anthracnose is grayish white with a red-brown border and purple margin.

Salal ,(Gaultheria shallon)-Root Rot,"Phytophthora cinnamomi, a water-mold, fungus-like  microorganism. The disease is favored in potted plants on plastic sheets, which hold water around the pots. The disease can spread when the sheets are used under other pots. This microorganism  survives as oospores or chlamydospores in plant debris such as rotted roots or foliage. Spores may be moved long distances in contaminated soil or through moving water. Spores germinate and produce sporangia and a swimming spore stage called zoospores, which attack fine roots and begin to rot the root system.


","Fine roots rot away, and a cinnamon-brown color  advances up into the root crown. There may be a sharp line  between healthy and diseased tissue in the root. Aboveground symptoms vary and include vein reddening, yellow-green leaves, and tan, dry leaves. Wilting is common because of root loss.


","

1) Use well-drained potting media.

2) Put pots on sloped gravel beds to avoid puddles beneath pots.

3) Do not overwater.

4) Avoid reusing pots from a previous crop for propagation.  If pots must be reused then wash off all debris and soak in a sanitizing solution or treat with aerated steam for 30 min.

","Use fungicides as preventative treatments. The Group 4 and 33 fungicides used to manage Phytophthora do not kill this organism.

"Seed Crop, Crucifers ",(Brassica and Raphanus spp.),,,,,
"Seed Crop, Crucifers ",(Brassica and Raphanus spp.)-Black Leg,"Leptosphaeria maculans (syn. Plenodomus lingam,  anamorph: Phoma lingam) is a fungus that can infect a range of cruciferous crops. Host plants include Brassica crops (broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cabbage, cauliflower, collards, canola, kale, mizuna, mustard greens, oilseed rape, oilseed turnip rape, rutabaga, turnip, etc.), Sinapis (white and yellow mustard), and Raphanus (daikon and radish). Cruciferous weeds common in the Pacific Northwest can be host to black leg, including: birdsrape mustard (Brassica rapa), black mustard (B. nigra), western yellow cress or curvepod yellowcress (Rorippa curvisiliqua), tansymustard (Descurainia pinnata), hedge mustard (Sisymbrium officinale), tumble mustard (S. altissimum), small tumbleweed mustard (S. loeselii), pennycress (Thlaspi arvense), mouseear cress (Arabidopsis  thaliana), annual wallrocket (Diplotaxis muralis), perennial wallrocket (D. tenuifolia), and wild radish (Raphanus raphanistrum). The fungus survives on plant debris as pseudothecia, which release ascospores that may be wind-borne long distances, at least several miles and perhaps further on storm fronts. The fungus survives in association with infected plant residues until the plant debris decomposes (up to 4 years). In fall-sown crops or winter weeds, pseudothecia can form on dead portions of infected plants prior to harvest and continue forming on infected plant residues remaining on the soil surface. In spring-sown crops, pseudothecia do not form on dead plant portions until after harvest, and their production on residues atop the soil typically starts the following fall after a couple of wet periods. Ascospores are released from the pseudothecia following wet or humid conditions and when mean temperatures are between 46°F and 59°F. Conditions conducive for ascospore production and release commonly occur during the fall, winter, and springtime throughout the Pacific Northwest. Trap plants deployed weekly in multiple sites around the Willamette Valley in western Oregon, beginning in October 2014 and 2015, showed that ascospore infections began around mid-October. During 2015-2016, ascospore infections of trap plants occurred from mid-October into May with severe disease pressure during February and March. Wounding, insect injury, or herbicide injury can result in greater disease severity.
Two types of pycnidia (which produce asexual spores known as pycnidiospores) can be found; one on infected, live plants (thinner-walled pycnidium with a neck) and the other on crop residues (thicker-walled pycnidium with a narrow ostiole). Pycnidiospores are dispersed by splashing rain or irrigation water, so pycnidiospore movement is limited to relatively short distances, but  pycnidiospores can add to the overall incidence and severity of  disease build-up within a field. Workers or equipment moving through infected plantings during wet conditions can spread  disease.
Black leg can also move with infected seed, Leptosphaeria can survive for years in association with seed. But regional epidemics are thought to arise from infected plant debris if seed lots used for planting are Leptosphaeria-free. Even low levels of seed infec-tion, when coupled with weather favorable for disease, can lead to severe losses, including stand die-out within a field. The Oregon Department of Agriculture requires that all crucifer seed, even half ounce or smaller packets, that is to be planted in Oregon must be accompanied by an official test showing that the untreated seed is free from black leg (Leptosphaeria species).
This disease can reduce seed yields. After a disease outbreak in a larger geographic area, the threat of seed loss in fall-sown crops is much greater due to the abundance of affected crop residues on the soil surface, especially if field-wide epidemics occur in no-till fields. Replanting or allowing volunteers to grow in a field site after a black leg epidemic can result in high numbers of infected seedlings by fall in western Oregon or Washington seed fields,  perpetuating the disease at that location. Planting adjacent to a  previously-infected field can result in a high disease incidence  (40 to 60%) by December in the new planting, while planting within a few miles of an infected residue site can result in generalized infections across new fields (1 to 5%). Researchers at OSU have observed uncontrolled black leg infections in fall-planted seed fields in western Oregon to increase from a low disease incidence (1 to 5%) to high (40 to 90% of the stand infected) in a 6-week period. Infections of fall-planted seed fields can lead to stand losses through winter into spring.


","Pale, irregular spots develop on cotyledons, leaves, stems or petioles, later becoming somewhat circular or oval,  ashy-gray with scattered tiny, black dots (pycnidia) on the surface.  Stem lesions that develop after the fungus moves systemically are elongated with purple borders, often near the soil line, and may girdle the stem or extend below the soil surface, causing a brown-to-gray to black rot in the lower stem and roots. Vascular tissues may turn black in color prior to external rot symptoms. Damping-off can occur if plants are infected at the seedling stage, usually through the use of infected seeds. Plants produced from infected seeds that survive the seedling stage are stunted and often develop a rot of the stem at or just below the soil line, which moves  upwards and can cause plant death.
As seed plants mature, they may fall sideways from lack of root anchorage or stem cankers may cause the top of the plant to fall over. Symptoms on seed pods are rare and inconspicuous. Black leg stem lesions may be invaded by Sclerotinia sclerotiorum or other secondary pathogens, masking black leg symptoms on stems of affected seed plants.


","

1) Control susceptible weeds and control volunteer crucifers.

2) Plant only seed certified to be to be free of . This is required for all , , and  seed planted within Oregon.

3) Treat infested seed 25 to 30 min. in water at 122°F (50°C).

4) Avoid planting in or adjacent to a site where disease has  occurred within the last 3 to 4 years; plantings within a quarter of a mile of a field containing black leg-infected crucifer  residues are at an increased risk for black leg.

5) Delay spring plantings to avoid periods of ascospore release. Bury residues as soon as possible after harvest by deep plowing, or remove plant debris. Flailing followed by a shallow incorporation may be sufficient depending on amount and size of plant debris as well as environmental conditions.

6) Seedbeds should not have crucifer crops on or near them for at least 5 years.

7) Transplants should not be dipped in water before transplanting.

8) Inspect seedbeds and seed fields for presence of the disease.

","Seed treatment and a foliar fungicide program will be essential if growing seed fields in any region where black leg epidemics have occurred across a larger geographic area.

"Seed Crop, Crucifers ",(Brassica and Raphanus spp.)-Black Rot,"Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris is a bacterium  that overwinters in plant refuse for up to 2 years and is carried  internally and externally on seed. The bacterium infects other  crucifer crops and weeds. It may be spread in the field by water (rain, irrigation), insects, equipment, and animals. Many outbreaks can be attributed to disease spread in the seedbed. When spread by water, bacteria enter water pores (hydathodes) at leaf margins or occasionally through insect or other mechanical injuries. From the leaf, the infection proceeds up and down the main stem and then becomes systemic. Disease development may stop in unfavorable weather only to resume when conditions are favorable. Optimum temperatures for development are 80°F to 86°F. Water in the form of dew, rain, or sprinkler irrigation is necessary for spread.


","Tissue at leaf margins becomes yellow; chlorosis progresses toward the leaf center, creating a V-shaped area with the base of the ""V"" at the leaf midrib. Veins in these areas become dark-brown or black; when the leaf is held up to a strong light source, they show up as a black net. Vascular tissue of the main stem then becomes blackened. As the infection becomes systemic, symptoms (the same as those found from direct infection) may appear anywhere on the plant. Unilateral stunting of some leaves occurs. In infected seed, the first symptoms appear on cotyledons, which rapidly wilt and drop off; usually however, the infection has reached the stem and proceeds up.

"Seed Crop, Crucifers ",(Brassica and Raphanus spp.)-Cladosporium Leaf Spot,"A fungus, Cladosporium variable. This fungus can grow under a wide range of temperatures, but 59°F to 68°F with relative humidity above 80% is most conducive to disease development  in seed-crop crucifers. Spores can be moved by air, rain splash,  or equipment.


","Early symptoms are numerous small, circular white to yellow spots, beginning on older leaves and progressing to younger ones. Spots often join together and then are irregularly shaped. When the fungus produces spores, spots change to an olive-black. Generally, older leaves die, but in severe infections all leaves may die and seed may be affected. Ripening seed on Swiss chard seed crops also may develop lesions and become shriveled.


",,"Fungicides used preventively help minimize the onset of infection and disease development.

"Seed Crop, Crucifers ",(Brassica and Raphanus spp.)-Downy Mildew (Staghead),"Peronospora parasitica (= Hyaloperonospora parasitica), a fungus-like microorganism that overwinters in roots, infected plant debris, or living seed crops and affects nearly all cultivated and weedy cruciferous plants. Several strains of the microorganism; however, are specific to certain groupings of crops. For example, the radish strain causes little damage to cabbage. Spores may be spread as contaminants on seeds. There is no proof that the fungus enters the seed. High humidity, fog, drizzling rains, and heavy dew favor disease development and spread. Optimum conditions for disease development are night temperatures of 46°F to 61°F for 4 or more successive nights, and day temperature about 75°F or lower. In areas with mild, wet winters, such as western Oregon or Washington, downy mildew can continue infecting fall-planted seed crops during the winter months, although only small amount of the total leaf surface area may be colonized on individual leaves, but this allows for a build-up within a field, potentially leading to severe increase in infections of spring growth if spring conditions are wet and mild. Fall and spring downy-mildew management is important for fall-planted seed fields to avoid extensive staghead formation, where an inflorescence is abnormal in shape and development due to downy mildew or white rust.  White rust and downy mildew are commonly found cohabitating together in leaf colonies on brassicas in western Oregon and elsewhere.
Resistance is being incorporated into commercial cultivars, but at present no resistant commercial cultivars are available.


","The first observable symptom is small, light green-yellow lesions on the upper leaf surface, later showing on the  undersurface. The spots turn yellow as they enlarge. During  periods of high humidity, a grayish-white moldy growth appears on the leaf's underside. Later the leaf may become papery and die. Cabbage heads develop sunken black spots, which may be minute or larger than 1 inch in diameter. Frequently, some plants become systemically infected in the seedling stage, but the black streaking and discoloration in leaves and stems does not become apparent until close to bolting.
On fall-planted seed crops, downy mildew can create tiny leaf spots during the winter months or other times where small clusters of, even just a few, conidia and conidiophores are produced on  the underside of the leaf surface; rarely in large enough quantity  to be seen without magnification. During warmer rain breaks,  individual lesions may rapidly enlarge and then quickly collapse with a secondary soft rot during rainy periods. This can be confused for cold-damaged tissues with subsequent secondary leaf rot, which can also be common in areas of Oregon and Washington seed production during certain winters.
Downy mildew on an inflorescence can lead to staghead formation, abnormal shape and development of the inflorescence due to downy mildew or white rust.  White rust and downy mildew are commonly found together in leaf colonies on brassicas in western Oregon and elsewhere.

"Seed Crop, Crucifers ",(Brassica and Raphanus spp.)-Light Leaf Spot,"The fungus, Cylindrosporium concentricum (sexual stage: Pyrenopeziza brassicae) has been found in Oregon on canola,  turnip, volunteer or wild radish, wild mustard, volunteer black mustard, vegetable Brassica seed fields, and Brassica species used as cover crops since 2014. The disease was found during 2016 in the Skagit Valley of western Washington on Brassica cover crops and wild mustard. All Brassica crops grown in the Pacific Northwest are probably susceptible but the specific host range within Brassicaceae is unknown at this time. Oilseed rape and cauliflower are reported to be more susceptible than Brussels sprouts or kale, but there is a range of susceptibility within each crop species.  The pathogen has been a problem on oilseed rape in various parts of the world with seed losses estimated at 22% when outbreaks have occurred in the United Kingdom. This disease hasn't been previously reported in North America though an infected mustard field was found in western Oregon during 1998. Oilseed rape is very susceptible and losses results from stand die-out, reduced pod numbers, premature pod ripening, or an overall growth reduction with less severe infections. Brassicas grown as vegetables in other areas of the globe, where this disease has been reported, suffer blemish defects by relatively mild infections, causing a decrease  in quality but not of yield quantity. Trichloroacetic acid-based herbicides may increase plant susceptibility by affecting the waxy layer of leaves.
Ascospores develop from apothecia on infected plant residues and can be wind-dispersed relatively long distances after a wetting period, infecting susceptible plants. Asexual spores (conidia) develop but spread relatively short distances by rain or splashing water, potentially causing pod infections during the following spring. Seed can be infected or casually infested with the asexual stage yet seed transmission occurs at very low rates due to rapid die-out of the pathogen on seed. Still, epidemics can be initiated by seedborne inoculum or from neighboring fields of infected plants or residues, or from infected volunteers. Wet conditions and cool temperatures (around 60°F is optimum) promote disease development. Fall-infected plants may remain symptomless through the winter season till the following spring.


","This fungus can attack leaves, stems and pods. Flecking may be observed on cotyledons while leaf infections start as discolored patches that develop into irregular brown lesions with cracked centers, sometimes turning black. Leaf lesions can coalesce, causing death of leaves. When leaves are infected young, distortion can develop. Stem lesions are elongated brownish streaks with grayish-black margins and can be mistaken for black leg, except lesions are usually superficial. Flower infections may cause abortion. Pods infected early appear distorted while pods  infected later result in relatively healthy looking pods but will  have white spore masses. Seedlings can be killed or plants may  be stunted.


","

1) Control susceptible weeds and volunteer cruciferous plants.

2) Remove plant debris or bury by deep-plowing, important for preventing sexual recombinants from developing with new virulence or fungicide resistance. Flailing followed by a  shallow incorporation may be sufficient depending on amount and size of plant debris as well as environmental conditions.

3) Rotate out of crucifers for 3 years.

4) Avoid planting adjacent to a field infected the previous season.

"Seed Crop, Crucifers ",(Brassica and Raphanus spp.)-Sclerotinia Stem Rot,"Sclerotinia sclerotiorum is a fungus that overwinters as small black structures (sclerotia) attached to decomposing pods and stems in soil. Sclerotia may survive several years. After a moisture-conditioning period of at least 70 days, they produce a small, stalked, cup-shaped fruiting structure (apothecium), which releases spores into the air. Spores may infect senescent tissue such as blossoms and leaves or may germinate and colonize plant debris. After colonizing, the fungus can invade any part of the plant with which it comes in contact. Moist conditions within the plant canopy favor infection, as do rain, dew, and/or irrigation practices that keep foliage wet for long periods. On seed crops, stem attacks can cause severe losses.
Host plants include bean, pea, lettuce, carrots, potato, sunflower, flower seed crops, crucifers, and cucurbits. Dandelion (Taraxacum officinale) is a very susceptible weed host.


","The disease is mainly on aboveground parts, producing first a water-soaked appearance followed by a cottony-white mold, unless conditions turn hot and dry. In seed crops, the stem is more commonly affected and infected plants can be scattered through a field, including field edges. Diseased stem tissues eventually bleach white, giving the disease its name ""white blight."" Sclerotia that are black on the surface and white inside, associated with this bleached tissue, are diagnostic.

1) Rotate using nonsusceptible crops such as grass or grains.

2) Encourage maximum air movement between rows.

","On seed crops of broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cabbage, cauliflower, Chinese cabbage, collard, kale, kohlrabi, mustard, rutabaga, and turnip, the most effective control is aerial fungicide sprays.

"Seed Crop, Crucifers ",(Brassica and Raphanus spp.)-White Leaf Spot and Gray Stem,"The fungus, Pseudocercosporella capsellae (sexual stage: Mycosphaerella capsellae) , has been observed in various Brassica seed crops in Oregon. It has been reported in oilseed rape in the United Kingdom and Canada. Pod losses of 15% have been reported in Europe. Turnip, Chinese cabbage, mustards and oilseed rape are thought to be more susceptible than cabbage, cauliflower, broccoli and other vegetable Brassica species. Horseradish and  radish are susceptible to white leaf spot as well as weedy types such as wild radish, wild mustard, and shepherd's purse.
How the pathogen overwinters in the Pacific Northwest is unknown at this time. In the United Kingdom, ascospores develop on infected Brassica or Raphanus residues during the autumn and can be wind-dispersed relatively long distances following rain or dew events. Beginning in late fall, the asexual spores (conidia) can develop and are spread relatively short distances by rain or splashing water, potentially causing pod infections during the following spring, although seed transmission is not thought to play a major role in disease spread. Temperatures of 50°F to 60°F under moist conditions promote disease development.


","This fungus can attack leaves, stems and pods. Tan, irregular or roundish spots develop on leaves, especially leaf tips and edges, later becoming ashy-gray to white with a brownish margin and sometimes a yellowish halo. White conidia can be observed on the underside of leaf spots. Leaf spots will become dark brown as leaves senesce, due to the initiation of the sexual stage. The center of older lesions may fall out, resulting in a shot hole appearance. Lesions may coalesce when disease is severe, resulting in defoliation. Stem lesions are elongated and first brown, turning ashy-gray to white with a brownish margin and numerous tiny dark specks due to the formation of the sexual stage; there is a distinct  boundary between diseased and healthy tissue on the stem. Gray stem lesions are superficial; the pith is not severely infected. Pod  infections are at first small brown spots that expand and turn grayish-white with numerous tiny dark specks due to the formation of the sexual stage.

Skimmia,Crown and Root Rot,"The OSU Plant Clinic has found several soilborne organisms associated with skimmia root problems including Phytophthora sp., Pythium sp., and Fusarium sp. in addition to Armillaria root rot.  These pathogens are typically favored by excessive soil moisture and/or poor drainage. Root rots tend to cause plants to wilt rather than become chlorotic. These plants are shade loving and may become chlorotic due to poor, dry soil, overexposure to the sun or mites.


","Roots become brown and rotted. Root crowns become soft, discolored and water-soaked. Above ground, the green leaves wilt due to non-function of the root system. Stem dieback may also occur.


","

1) Use new trays and pots with clean soilless media. If pots must be reused then wash off all debris and soak in a sanitizing  solution or treat with aerated steam for 30 min.

2) Do not overwater.

3) Provide good drainage for plants in beds, fields, or containers. Place containers on gravel beds (4 inches or more deep) to  allow drainage. Do not place containers on poly sheets; they can prevent containers from draining into soil and allow  contaminated drainage water to spread from the base of  one container to another.

","No chemicals are specially registered for this crop and none were found in the IR-4 research database.

Skimmia,Leaf Spots,"The OSU Plant Clinic has found Ascochyta sp. and Pleospora sp. in association with leaf spots of skimmia. Leaves may become wet for extended periods of time in the shade, which is favorable for leaf spotting organisms. These plants are shade loving and may become chlorotic due to poor, dry soil, overexposure to the sun or mites.


","Size, shape or color have not been recorded or  described.

Smoke Tree ,(Cotinus coggygria)-Verticillium Wilt,"Verticillium dahliae, a soilborne fungus that affects many annual and perennial plant species. The fungus produces microsclerotia in the tissues of diseased plants. Microsclerotia are released into the soil as plant tissue decomposes and may persist in soil for many years. The microsclerotia germinate, penetrate roots, and colonize the xylem system. Colonization leads to a decrease in the amount of water able to reach the leaves. Found several times by the OSU Plant Clinic.


","May occur within a few weeks of planting into infested soil. Leaves become wilted or light brown and appear scorched, sometimes only on one side of the leaf or near the leaf margins. Symptomatic leaves may fall prematurely or hang on dead branches. Branches may wilt at the tips. Sapwood appears discolored  with reddish brown streaks, compared to normal sapwood, which is yellowish white. Symptoms may occur on several random branches on a plant or on only one side of a branch. Infected plants may die within a few months. Overall growth may be stunted.


","

1) Use only pathogen-free nursery stock.

2) Test soil before planting to select a site with no detectable  microsclerotia.

3) Avoid planting in fields with a history of Verticillium wilt.

4) Preplant soil solarization has been helpful in reducing  populations of certain soilborne pathogens and weeds in  western Oregon. Place clear plastic (preferably anti-condensation film) directly on smooth, rototilled ground, which has been irrigated to field capacity and then allowed to drain for 1-2 days. Bury the edges of the plastic to trap the heat.  Solarize for 4-6 weeks (or longer) during the hottest part of the summer, beginning in early- to mid-July.

5) Prune off and burn symptomatic branches.

6) Clean pruning equipment after use.

7) Replace infected or dead plants with nonsusceptible plants.

","Preplant soil fumigation may be helpful when grown under nursery conditions.

Snapdragon ,(Antirrhinum majus)-Damping-off,"Both Pythium spp. a fungus-like microorganism and Rhizoctonia solani, a fungus, can cause pre- and post-emergence damping-off. Pythium irregulare, the species found frequently in the Northeastern United States, is favored by cool and overly moist soil conditions. Pythium spp. can survive in dust, planting media, or soil particles on greenhouse floors, flats, and pots. Spread can also occur via movement of infected plants. Seedlings are susceptible during the first two weeks of germination but rapidly become resistant as the first new leaves are formed. The organism can enter roots damaged by high soluble salts from overfertilization.
Rhizoctonia survives in soil as sclerotia or as mycelium colonizing bits of organic matter. Roots become infected as they grow past these structures. The fungus then grows along root surface and forms an aggregation called an infection cushion, then pushes into the root where it colonies and kills the tissue. The fungus can form knots of mycelium that develop into sclerotia. These are released into the soil as the plant debris decomposes. The fungus can be spread by water, contaminated tools, transportation of infected plants, and propagation of infected plants. Disease is favored by high temperatures and moderately moist soils.
High substrate pH may cause stunted or uneven seedling growth or poor root development, which may be confused with damping-off. Very high pH may result in iron or boron deficiency. Yellow interveinal chlorosis of upper leaves may be caused by iron deficiency resulting from high pH or a cool, wet medium, which reduces iron uptake.


","Stems of seedlings or recent transplants collapse at the soil line and die. Pythium turns root tips brown; they then decay. Basal stem tissues below the soil line may also rot. Plants often  remain stunted, chlorotic and wilt. Rhizoctonia forms red-brown lesions near the soil line. Wilting, collapse and death occur if  lesions girdle the stem. It is not easy to tell these organisms apart by visual inspection so send to your Plant Clinic for a diagnosis.


","

1) Plant in pasteurized, well-drained raised beds.

2) Rotate to different beds from year to year.

3) For greenhouse production, start seeds in a sterile media of pH 5.5 to 5.8 and at a temperature of 65°F to 75°F.

4) Do not overfertilize.

5) Many cultivars need light for germination so germinate with little or no media covering seeds.

6) Keep media evenly moist but not overly wet.

7) Avoid reusing pots or trays from a previous crop for propagation. If pots or trays must be reused then wash off all debris and soak in a sanitizing solution or treat with aerated steam for 30 min.

Snapdragon ,(Antirrhinum majus)-Downy Mildew,"The fungus-like organism Peronospora antirrhini causes a systemic infection of young snapdragons. The disease is favored by cool, wet conditions and/or high humidity. Spores are produced between 44°F and 72°F, though 50°F is optimum. Sporangia are spread by wind, air currents, or splashing water. When they land  on a healthy plant they germinate by means of a germ tube.  Conditions that keep leaves wet for 6 to 10 hours favors this  disease. The latent period can be as short as 4 days. Oospores  are produced in abundance in infected tissue. Seed transmission may occur but has not been proved.
The cultivars Potomac Rose, Potomac Apple, and Potomac Dark Orange are less susceptible than cultivars Rocket White, Potomac Ivory, and Potomac Royal.


","Leaves curl in and droop down on seedlings. Affected plants are stunted and pale yellowish green. Dark-color cultivars develop purple spots; light-color cultivars develop yellow spots. Leaves' undersides may develop a white to purplish fungal growth (conidia and conidiophores). Stems and upper leaf surfaces can also show this symptom on young succulent plants. Severely  infected plants are stunted, wilt, and eventually die. Larger plants can also be stunted, have pale-green leaves, lack flowering, and may have rosetting of the growing points. The growing point  usually dies, and the plant often breaks off at the base, and then produces many secondary shoots from the base.


","The best management strategy is to integrate as many tactics as practical and economical as possible.

1) Reduce greenhouse humidity by a combination of heating, venting, and moving air. Space plants for good air circulation.

2) Scout plants carefully for symptoms of the disease especially the undersides of leaves and any stock plants or plants held over from the previous year.

3) Avoid overhead irrigation or any practice that keeps plants wet for extended periods of time.

4) Remove and destroy infected plants and plant debris.

5) Plant resistant cultivars.

Snapdragon ,(Antirrhinum majus)-Powdery Mildew,"The fungus Golovinomyces orontii (formerly Erysiphe cichoracearum) has been reported from Washington. Conidia are released in response to abrupt decreases in relative humidity. Wind blows conidia to healthy foliage where they start new mildew colonies. Too much water, such as flowing water or rain, destroys spores by causing them to burst. The fungus does not grow in a leaf but rather across the surface. Small anchor cells of the fungus, haustoria, remain in the leaf and take nourishment from the plant, but the main filament and the multitudes of spores it produces are outside the leaf. The disease can develop under relatively dry conditions in spring and summer so long as the air is humid. Plants in shade tend to have more problems because that environment favors disease development. Multiple disease cycles occur during the growing season. Plants can be infected at any growth stage.  Cleistothecia form in older infected plant tissues, survive in plant debris, and produce ascospores the next season.


","White powdery areas appear on both surfaces of leaves. Older leaves may wilt and become necrotic. Severely  infected leaves may wilt and die. Stem infections are cultivar  dependent.

Snowberry ,(Symphoricarpos spp.)-Leaf Spots,"Many fungi are capable of causing necrotic leaf spots on snowberry. Of these, Phyllosticta symphoricarpi, Ascochyta tenerrima, Septoria symphoricarpi, and Sphaceloma symphoricarpi (anthracnose) are reported as widespread throughout Northwestern States. In addition, Septoria signalensis has been confirmed in  Idaho; however, Septoria symphoricarpi is likely the most significant leaf spot pathogen of this genus for the region. Most fungal leaf spots are favored by wet weather that keeps leaves wet for  extended periods of time. They generally survive unfavorable  conditions in plant debris.
Colletotrichum gloeosporioides has also been reported as causing leaf spots. Aschochyta tenerrima has been reported on this genus in Washington and is widespread in North America and Europe. Passalora symphoricarpi (formerly Cercospora symphoricarpi) is reported as a foliar pathogen in central and Eastern North America.


","Spots form as leaves emerge in the spring; first as dark brown lesions that become bleached and necrotic in the centers as the lesion expands. Lesions may coalesce over time as the disease develops. Black fruiting bodies (pycnidia or acervuli) may form within necrotic areas of advanced lesions.
Anthracnose is characterized with lesions on green stems, flowers, and fruits in addition to leaves. In severe cases infected parts may become distorted. Lesions on fruits are sunken, circular, and pink-brown colored, often resulting in the mummification of the berry.


","

1) Remove and destroy spotted leaves and/or plants as they  appear.

Soybean ,(Glycine max)-Soybean Rust,"Two fungi, Phakopsora pachyrhizi and P. meibomiae, cause rust on soybean, snap bean, dry bean, cowpea, and numerous other legume species. P. pachyrhizi is considered the more aggressive strain on soybean and also infects kudzu (Pueraria lobata). Disease increases on leaf surfaces during prolonged periods of wet weather and temperatures range from 59°F to 86°F. The soybean rust fungus is not expected to overwinter where temperatures dip below 32° F; however, plant debris contained in seed lots may harbor the rust fungus and enable spread of the pathogen. This disease has not been reported in the Pacific Northwest but P. pachyrhizi was detected on soybean in other regions of the United States


","Lesions start as small gray spots on the underside of leaf surfaces, turning tan or reddish brown, leaf chlorosis may  appear on the upper leaf surface. Lesions are angular due to  restriction by leaf veins. Lesions often appear first on older leaves but they also may appear on petioles, stems, and pods. They  contain pustules that appear as small, scattered blisters filled with tan urediniospores. Dark brown to black telia develop among  uredinia. Severely affected fields have a yellowing or browning coloration and premature senescence.

Spinach ,(Spinacia oleracea)-Fusarium Wilt,"Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. spinaciae, a fungus that can survive many years in soil without a spinach crop. The fungus also can colonize roots of beet and Swiss chard plants, but does not cause disease on these crops. The fungus can survive on seed and cause disease in fields previously free of spinach wilt. Warm, acidic soils favor the pathogen.


","Two types are observed commonly in seed crops: a seedling disease, which can be confused with damping-off; and premature dying of older plants.
In the seedling stage, plants appear normal until the first true leaves form. Then cotyledon leaves wilt and in 7 to 10 days the plant dies. Roots may have a black lesion at the base, and vascular tissue will be dark or discolored; few feeder roots develop. Plants may die any time from seedling stage to seed-crop maturity.
Symptoms on older plants include general yellowing of lower leaves, early maturity, premature death, and reduced seed production; in some instances, the plant dies before developing seed. Older plants may have darkened vascular tissue and extensive  secondary-root development. The stem base is discolored, and  fungal mycelium may be seen. In general, older diseased plants  appear to be suffering from extreme drought and/or severe root rot.


","

1) Avoid planting on soil known to be infested with Fusarium wilt of spinach.

2) Do not plant spinach in consecutive years. A 4- to 6-year  rotation may help control wilt, although 6- to 12-year rotations may be necessary for spinach seed crops with susceptible  parent (inbred) lines on acid soils.

3) Planting early may reduce seedling disease because of lower soil temperature during initial plant development.

4) The smooth-leaf cultivars St. Helens and Jade and semisavoy types 'Chinook II' and 'Skookum' are either resistant or  tolerant to Fusarium wilt.

5) If not growing the crop for seed, do not let plants flower and go to seed.

6) Amendment of acid soils (pH < 6.5) with limestone (at least 1 or 2 tons agricultural limestone/acre) can suppress Fusarium wilt in spinach seed crops.

7) If possible, minimize moisture stress to spinach seed crops during flowering and seed set.

Spinach ,(Spinacia oleracea)-Leaf Spot,"A complex of fungi is associated with leaf spot disease on spinach, but Cladosporium variable is believed to be the primary pathogen under cool and moist conditions. This fungus can grow under a wide range of temperatures, but 59°F to 68°F with relative humidity above 80% is most conducive to disease development. Spores can be moved by air, rain or irrigation splash, or equipment. Volunteer spinach can serve as a reservoir, particularly following spinach seed crops when many volunteers may develop in the field over the winter from seed that shattered to the ground during seed harvest. Some semisavoy types like 'Ozarka II' and 'Fall Green' have been shown highly susceptible in greenhouse tests and field observations.


","Early symptoms are numerous small, circular white to yellow spots, beginning on older leaves and progressing to younger ones. Spots often join together and then are irregularly shaped. Older spots develop a narrow darker-colored margin with a tan center. When the fungus produces spores, spots change to an olive-black. Generally, older leaves die, but in severe infections all leaves may die and seed may be affected. Ripening seed on spinach seed crops also may develop lesions, shrivel, and become infected with the fungus.


","

1) Disc volunteer plants into the ground before planting spring crops.

2) Avoid highly susceptible plant types.

3) Hot water treatment of spinach seed at 104°F to 122°C for 10 to 20 min. can be very effective. Seed must be dried well after treatment to avoid reduction in shelf life.

Spinach ,(Spinacia oleracea)-Spinach Blight,"Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV), a pathogen spread by insects such as aphids and cucumber beetles and mechanically by cultivation and handling. CMV overwinters in seeds of wild cucumber and in wild perennial milkweed, ground cherry, and matrimonial vine. It also has a wide range of vegetable crop hosts. Epidemics often are associated with unusually high temperatures. Isolates of CMV in spinach belong to serogroup I or serogroup II. CMV serogroup II isolates can be seedborne and seed-transmitted in spinach. Rates of seed transmission are relatively low (<2%) for most cultivars, but seed transmission can be >20% for some cultivars. CMV can also be carried by spinach pollen. Therefore, infected male or female spinach plants can serve as a source of  inoculum for infection of seed in spinach seed crops.


","A yellow and green leaf mottle and mild leaf distortion. The margins of infected leaves may role downwards. Infected plants can be stunted. Symptoms are more severe the younger the age at which spinach plants become infected.

Spinach ,(Spinacia oleracea)-Stemphylium Leaf Spot,"A fungus, Stemphylium botryosum f. sp. spinacia, first found in California in 1997, reported in Oregon, and found in spinach seed crops in Washington in 2000. Although there are many crops with leaf spot caused by S. botryosum, the isolates pathogenic on spinach do not appear to be pathogenic on other crops, and vice versa. The fungus can grow under a wide range of temperatures, but does most damage at 65°F to 74°F when relative humidity is above 80%. Spores are disseminated by air, rain or irrigation splash, or on equipment. The fungus can also be seedborne, not only on the pericarp but also in the embryo. After harvest of spinach seed crops, the sexual stage of the fungus, Pleospora herbarum, forms black, pinhead-size fruiting bodies (pseudothecia) on spinach crop residues that remain on the soil surface (especially 'woody' stems and branches). P. herbarum does not form fruiting bodies on buried residues. The fruiting bodies mature over the winter and forcibly discharge spores into the air in the spring when temperatures increase.


","At first, leaf spots are pinpoint in size, circular, and sunken, but expand to become gray-green and up to 0.25-inch in diameter with an oval or round shape. Leaf spots expand and turn tan in color as disease progresses; finally, coalescing leaf spots turn brown as infected leaf tissue dries out and turns papery. Disease can be confused with spray injury or leaf spot caused by Cladosporium variabile, although lesions caused by the latter tend to be smaller, remain circular, and develop a narrow darker margin as they mature. Symptoms develop most rapidly on older leaves, and severe disease pressure can cause defoliation.


","

1) After harvest of spinach seed crops, incorporate residues  into the soil to prevent the sexual stage of the fungus from forming fruiting bodies on residues that remain on the soil  surface. Disk volunteer plants and residues into the soil before the winter so that inoculum does not mature on the residues over the winter.

2) Hot water treatment of spinach seed at 104°F to 122°C for 10 to 20 min. can be partially effective. Seed must be dried well after treatment to avoid reduction in shelf-life.

","Fungicides used preventively help minimize the onset of infection and disease development. Spinach pollen makes S. botryosum much more aggressive as a pathogen of spinach. Therefore, protective fungicide applications are recommended just prior to initiation of pollen shed in spinach seed crops.

Spinach ,(Spinacia oleracea)-Verticillium Wilt,": Verticillium dahliae, a fungus that can survive many years in soil without a spinach crop. The fungus colonizes roots of spinach plants, from where it invades the vascular system and moves systemically up the plant into the leaves (and developing seed in spinach seed crops). The highly systemic nature of infection means the fungus readily infects developing seed in spinach seed crops planted in infested soils. The fungus is readily seed-transmitted from infected spinach seed. Isolates of V. dahliae pathogenic on spinach belong to two vegetative compatibility groups (VCG), VCG2 and VCG4.


","Symptoms of Verticillium wilt are not observed in fresh market or processing spinach crops, as symptoms only develop after bolting has been initiated (transition from vegetative to reproductive growth). Therefore, the disease only causes losses in spinach seed crops. However, planting infected spinach seed into soils can lead to infestation of the soil with the pathogen. Isolates of V. dahliae from spinach can infect potato crops. Symptoms on bolted plants start as interveinal yellowing of the lower leaves,  and progress to interveinal necrosis. Symptoms then progress  to younger leaves as the plant matures. Infected plants may be severely stunted with reduced seed set. Unlike Fusarium wilt, vascular tissue in roots and stems of spinach plants infected with Verticillium wilt is a light brown color.


","

1) Avoid planting on soil known to be infested with .

2) Do not plant spinach in consecutive years. Long rotations out of spinach seed crops may be necessary for susceptible parent (inbred) lines.

","Leaves yellow prematurely, typically first at the margins and progressing in; veins and midribs tend to stay green. Oldest leaves tend to yellow first. Yellow symptoms progress up the plant, which results in reduced and abnormal growth that is unmarketable.


","The disease is very difficult to control due to the wide host range. Attempts are under way to identify cultivars and breeding lines that are both suitable to the Pacific Northwest and resistant to the virus.

1) Separate new plantings from infected crops by as much space and time as feasible.

Spruce  ,(Picea spp.)-Sparassis Root Rot,"Sparassis crispa (formerly Sparassis radicata) , a fungus reported to be common in Washington on Engelmann spruce.  Can also occur on Douglas-fir, ponderosa pine, white fir, and southwestern white pine. Both heartwood and sapwood are  decayed in the roots but only heartwood in the lower trunk. It is not known how the fungus gains entry into the roots but it is not via fire scars or wounds. Tree-to-tree spread appears to be via root grafts or root-to-root contact.


","The fungus develops yellowish-white mycelial  fans under the bark of the roots of old trees. The wood initially  becomes reddish, finally turning yellowish brown. In the advanced stage, elongated pits filled with white mycelium are present in the decayed roots. Diseased roots are covered with resin. The fruiting bodies are found on the ground near infected roots. The base of  the fruiting structure is a perennial stalk, which is connected to a decayed root. The annual growths, which consist of numerous, thin, leaf-like branches, are produced in a cluster measuring up to a foot in diameter. They are white to cream in color and arise each year from the perennial stalk (sometimes called the cauliflower fungus).

Spruce ,(Picea spp.)-Bud Failure,"A physiological disorder that affects the uppermost bud(s) on the terminal shoot (leader) of Colorado blue spruce (Picea  pungens). Possibly caused by either a calcium deficiency or by high temperatures the previous growing season. Genetics likely play a role in tree susceptibility.


","The first evidence of bud failure is in late winter when the terminal bud, especially on the leader, appears to die. It first turns ash-gray to dark brown, then hard and resinous. Sometimes, the stem just below the bud dies back a short distance (0.5 to 4 inches). Needles on the shoot near the terminal bud become chlorotic (yellow) and soon drop. In spring, buds below the affected stem grow normally and compete for dominance. This results in a tree with multiple leaders. Repeated damage results in stunted, wide trees. Occasionally, buds on lateral branches are damaged.


","

1) Prune or train the tree in summer to a single leader.

Spruce ,(Picea spp.)-Cytospora Canker,"Cytospora kunzei (sexual: Valsa kunzei), a fungus that has not been reported in the Pacific Northwest but has been found by the OSU Plant Clinic. The disease is more common in the Northeastern United States. Rain splashes spores to wounded branches. The fungus infects through wounded tissue. Other species infect pine, Douglas-fir, and true firs. They also infect trees weakened by drought, fire, insects, and other diseases, most importantly dwarf mistletoe.


","Cankers start around bases of small twigs or trunks. Branches near the ground turn brown and die. More branches continue to die slowly up the tree. Occasionally high branches are attacked. The needles may drop right away or persist for a year. Eventually dry brittle twigs are left. White patches of pitch or resin may appear along the bark of dead or dying branches. Cankers are not readily seen unless the bark is cut back exposing the diseased tissue. Small black fruiting bodies (pycnidia) of the fungus may be seen in the cankered area.


","

1) Remove and destroy infected branches.

2) Avoid injuries to the bark from such things as lawn mowers and gardening equipment.

3) Maintain healthy trees in the landscape through watering and fertility.

Spruce ,(Picea spp.)-Drought Injury,,,,,
Spruce ,(Picea spp.)-Needle Distortion,"Unknown. Serbian spruce (Picea omorika) appears to  sustain the most damage, but has been observed on a number of different spruce species and cultivars. Examinations of spruce, even before the bud cap has fallen off, have failed to find any signs of fungi, insects (which includes frass or exuvia) or eriophyid mites. Herbicide damage was suspected but the same degree of incidence was observed in treated vs. non-treated plots. The field pattern can be spotty but sometimes an entire block might show some effect. The problem is severe enough to make nursery-grown plants unsalable.
A similar fasciation has been reported in P. abies due to a phytoplasma but the symptoms are more typical of fasciations observed in other plants and not like the problem described here.


","The main symptom is a subtle to dramatic distortion and hardening of the needles. Shoots are stunted with needles closely pressed to one another like they were glued together. Shoots and/or needle bases may continue to expand while needle tips do not separate resulting in strange twists and turns of shoots and needle groups.


","

1) Prune to remove the disfigured growth to retain marketability of affected plants.

","Until a specific cause is identified it is  unwarranted to use fungicides or insecticides to try and control  the problem.

Spruce ,(Picea spp.)-Phytophthora Root Rot,"The fungus-like microorganisms Phytophthora cactorum and P. cinnamomi have been reported on spruce, but it generally is considered a tolerant plant and grows in spite of root rot. Nevertheless, the OSU Plant Clinic has diagnosed it regularly. Root rot is a problem when plants are in containers or areas with poor drainage or flooding. The pathogens survive as spores in the soil, organic debris, container media or infected tissue. Root infections occur in the spring when soils are at or near saturation. Infection can also occur through pruning wounds.
Seedlings of Sitka spruce (P. sitchensis) and Engelmann spruce (P. engelmannii) were considered tolerant when challenge inoculated with 5 species common in forest nurseries: P. cactorum, P. cryptogea, P. drechsleri, P. megasperma and P. pseudotsugae.


","These organisms attack the roots, which rot and die. The infection moves up into the root crown, where the vascular cambium (soft inner bark) turns reddish brown instead of the normal greenish white. Trees may show wilting, branch dieback, or other symptoms of inhibited water and nutrient uptake.


","

1) Avoid soil compaction, which reduces drainage. Construction, heavy foot traffic, or machinery can cause soil compaction.

2) Improve soil drainage by incorporating organic material or  using raised beds.

3) Prevent disease by planting only pathogen-free materials in uninfected soil.

4) Remove and destroy all infected plants and plant debris.

5) Avoid reusing pots from a previous crop for propagation. If pots must be reused then wash off all debris and soak in a  sanitizing solution or treat with aerated steam for 30 min.

","If needed, use fungistatic compounds. Use  fungicides as preventative treatments. The Group 4 and 33  fungicides used to manage Phytophthora do not kill this organism. They can only prevent establishment of the organism before it  gets into the plant. They can also prevent continued growth if the organism is already inside the plant thereby delaying symptoms that might have developed. Once chemical activity has subsided with time, the organism can resume growth within infected plants. Rotate fungicides that have a different mode of action for  resistance management.

Spruce ,(Picea spp.)-Rhizosphaera Needle Cast,"Rhizosphaera kalkhoffii is the most prevalent cause  although several other fungi (such as R. pini, Lophodermium sp., Lirula sp.) can cause needle cast diseases on spruce. The fungus overwinters in infected needles attached to the tree or on the ground. Rain-splashed spores spread to current-season needles. Shearing crews also can spread spores if foliage is wet. Infection requires wet periods over 48 hours at optimal temperatures. Young trees may die if weather favors the disease several years in a row.
The disease has been described on Christmas trees in the Eastern United States and has been a problem in Pacific Northwest nurseries and landscape trees. Colorado blue spruce and Engelmann spruce are highly susceptible; white spruce is intermediate; Norway spruce is relatively resistant. Other conifer hosts include pine, Douglas-fir, true fir, and western hemlock.


","At first, current-season needles mottle yellow late in the summer. They soon turn brown or, on blue spruce, purplish brown. Brown needles are shed the next spring and summer. The fungus produces a fruiting body (pycnidia), which emerges from stomata. These small, black pycnidia are in rows on the underside of the needle. The disease is first on lower branches and gradually moves up the tree year after year.


","

1) Use pathogen-free planting stock.

Spruce ,(Picea spp.)-Rusts,"Chrysomyxa sp., a fungus. Species reported from the Northwest include C. arctostaphyli (spruce broom rust, with kinnikinnick as the other host); C. ledicola (with labrador-tea, Ledum sp., as the other host); C. piperiana (with Rhododendron macrophyllum as the other host); and C. weirii, which does not need an alternate host. The teliospores germinate in spring and form basidiospores, which the wind carries to young spruce needles. Infection is in wet weather. The orangish aeciospores that develop later in the year on these needles spread to the alternate host. Spores that develop from these infections (urediniospores) can reinfect the alternate host but not the spruce until teliospores form. C. weirii produces teliospores on last season's needles, which infect current-season needles.


","C. arctostaphyli causes large witches' brooms in spruce. Brooms lose the green of normal foliage and turn yellow during the year as opposed to witches' brooms caused by other pathogens that retain the color. Orange-yellow powdery rust spores form on the brooms' needles in summer. Needles are cast off in fall and winter. Brooms are associated with spiketops, dead branches, bole deformations, loss of annual growth increment, and death. On kinnikinnick, the rust is most noticeable in late spring when telia on leaf undersurfaces become orange-brown.
C. ledicola and C. piperiana prematurely defoliate spruce.  Current-year needles develop a yellow-green discoloration that eventually becomes white outgrowths with orangish centers  (aecia). These may be star-like when viewed individually on the needle surface. Needles drop from the tree making the crown seem especially thin. Labrador-tea and rhododendron develop orange-brown pustules (uredinia and telia) on upper leaf surfaces.
C. weirii also prematurely defoliates spruce but produces telia on last season's needles. These are orange, tongue-shape outgrowths from yellowed bands on the needles.

Spores are rain-splashed from one tree or seedling to another. Infection is on or near the base of needles on new shoots as they begin to grow in the spring. Seedling  infestation occurs when the fungus colonizes the seed cones.


","New shoots die back in summer. At first, needles may turn brown starting at the base or fall off in the middle of the shoot near the infection point.

Squash ,(Cucurbita spp.)-Crown and Foot Rot,"Fusarium solani f. sp. cucurbitae (teleomorph: Nectria haematococca) is a problem in summer squash and some pumpkin cultivars though most cucurbits are susceptible under laboratory tests. The fungus can survive 2 to 3 years as chlamydospores in soil or plant debris, or longer by growing on the roots of other plants. It also can spread by infected seed (internally or externally infected) but reportedly survives on seed no longer than 2 years. Pre- and postharvest rot of the fruit can occur, especially where there has been soil contact. There is specialization within this  fungus and two races have been reported.


","Plants at any stage of growth can be infected. Infection of an older plant is usually noticed once wilting occurs, and death of the affected plant may soon follow. Affected plants have a characteristic rot of the crown and upper tap root area. A soft mushy rot of the stem, which turns dark brown at the base, may be visible when soil is removed. Early infections appear as a root rot with light-color, water-soaked areas that turn darker. The root cortex sloughs off, but the fibrous vascular tissue remains. Under wet soil conditions, the primary root may be infected but usually infection is through the crown, secondary roots, or the stem immediately above the soil line. A white to pink fungal growth may be visible at the soil line. Fruit can be infected if in contact with the soil under wetter conditions.

Squash ,(Cucurbita spp.)-Gummy Stem Blight (Black Rot),"A fungus, Didymella bryoniae (asexual: Phoma cucurbitacearum), which overwinters on crop refuse and attacks numerous other cucurbits. The fungus will not survive in soil without cucurbit refuse or other cucurbit hosts. A small wound on the fruit, such as a fingernail scratch, is sufficient for disease development. The fungus will not grow below 50°F and can attack all parts of the plant.


","On leaves, brown to black circular spots generally associated with the leaf margins progress toward the center of the leaf. Stem infections will girdle the plant. On fruit, the fungus causes circular water-soaked spots. Regardless of where the lesion occurs, a gummy exudate is usually in the spot's center. Later the spot becomes covered with white mycelium and tiny black fungal fruiting structures (pycnidia and perithecia). The fungus causes a dry rot of the squash flesh.

Squash ,(Cucurbita spp.)-Powdery Mildew,"The fungi, Golovinomyces cucurbitacearum (formerly G. cichoracearum and Erysiphe cichoracearum), Podosphaera xanthii (formerly P. fuliginea and Sphaerotheca fuliginea), and Leveillula taurica (anamorph = Oidiopsis taurica) can all infect the cucurbits, including squash but G. cucurbitacearum has a lower optimum temperature while P. xanthii appears to more aggressive on cucurbits and causes disease during the warmer summer months. Infection can occur between 50°F and 90°F with 68°F to 81°F being optimum; temperatures above 100°F are reported to halt disease.
Rarely is the sexual stage (chasmothecium) observed in the Pacific Northwest. However, these fungi readily produce conidia, which can be dispersed from infected plants in greenhouses or in the field. Conidia can be moved by wind across long distances. Warm temperatures and dew formation in summer favor disease development; high relative humidity favors infection while drier conditions promote colony growth as well as production and dispersal of conidia. In 3 to 7 days after infection, colonies are visible. Dense plantings and low light conditions promote disease.


","First, tiny white superficial spots appear on leaves and stem. Spots become powdery white and expand to cover all portions of the plant. Sometimes the mycelium becomes covered with small black structures (chasmothecia) about the size of a pinhead. Usually the disease is in scattered spots in the field but can sometimes be widespread. Severely infected leaves may turn brown, exposing the fruit to sunscald and possibly affecting rind color or storability of winter squash.


","

1) Plant resistant cultivars if available (See Varieties Tolerant to Powdery Mildew). Though not immune, these varieties will develop disease more slowly.

2) A 2-year rotation out of cucurbits is helpful in case  chasmothecia were produced on a previous cucurbit crop.

3) Avoid establishment of plants where shaded by tall plants or structures.

4) Avoid planting too dense of stands.

Dead tissue cracks, breaking away until the whole leaf looks ragged.
Fruit exudes a sticky substance in drops, much as if from an insect puncture. Spots gradually turn gray, become slightly sunken, and enlarge to about 0.12 inch in diameter.

Squash ,(Cucurbita spp.)-Storage Rots,"The common storage diseases of squash are Alternaria fruit rot (Alternaria cucumerina), black rot (Didymella bryoniae), Fusarium rot (many Fusarium spp. including F. solani f. sp. cucurbitae, the cause of crown and foot rot), scab (Cladosporium cucumerinum), and bacterial soft rot (Erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora = Pectobacterium carotovorum subsp. carotovorum). These diseases can be in the field in the growing season or during postharvest handling and storage. Skin wounds after bruising are especially prone to decay. Clean wounds in squash often heal without decay. Bruises do not, especially if the skin breaks. Fusarium equiseti also penetrates cut stem ends.
Chilling injury, whether from frost in the field or from improper storage or transit conditions after harvest, also can result in rots. All cucurbits have tropical ancestors and are physiologically disrupted at low temperatures. The freezing point of winter squashes average 29.3°F with maximum-minimum extremes of 29.5°F and 28.9°F. The longer the exposure and the lower the temperature, the greater the damage.


","Alternaria fruit rot-fruit decay is dry and tough on the surface but moist and spongy inside the squash.
Black rot-circular, water-soaked spots develop on the fruit surface. Lesions can have a drop of gummy exudate in the center. Later, under humid conditions, the spot becomes covered with white mycelium and the tiny black fungal fruiting structures (pycnidia and perithecia). Infected flesh is brown, soft, dry, and odorless.
Fusarium rot-there are a wide range of symptoms, from small pits, corky dry rot, or a colored, spongy rot ranging from grayish, whitish to pinkish, purplish, or reddish coloration that can occur in storage, often starting at the stem end.
Scab-lesions are dark and sunken, forming a cavity. A dark green, velvety layer can occur in the cavities.
Bacterial soft rot-flesh disintegrates into a soft mass. If the skin ruptures further, it releases infective juices and a foul odor.
Chilling injury-early symptoms include numerous water-soaked or sunken spots. Tissue has an increased tendency to fungal or  bacterial decay. Symptoms may not develop until fruit is returned to higher temperature.


","Control lies in integrated disease control in  the field and very careful handling, good curing, and right storage environment.

1) Rotate out of squash and other cucurbits for 4 years.

2) Avoid fields with a history of severe disease and avoid  moving soil with pathogen propagules from infested fields  to other fields.

3) Use laboratory-tested pathogen-free seed, which will help  prevent introduction of pathogen into new fields.

4) Select fields with good water drainage and avoid  over-irrigation.

5) Avoid the injury of fruit during harvest, packing, and transport.

6) Before frosts, take all marketable mature and immature squash from the field.

7) Do not cure winter squash in the field. Move promptly from field to curing room.

8) Remove stems completely to prevent stem-end infections.

9) Handle squash with care to avoid wounds and bruises during harvest, packing, and transport.

10) Remove and destroy all infected or damaged fruit before  storage.

11) Dry squash thoroughly for 2 weeks with circulating air at 80°F to 85°F. However, temperatures higher than 65°F may increase pink rot.

12) Store squash at 50°F to 55°F and at 70°F to 75% relative humidity. Do not store winter squash long below 50°F. Hard-shelled squash such as Hubbard can be stored up to 6 months  if properly handled and cured.

Squash ,(Cucurbita spp.)-Verticillium Wilt,,,,,
Squash ,(Cucurbita spp.)-Virus Diseases,"The three most common virus diseases in Oregon are zucchini yellows caused by the Zucchini yellows mosaic virus (ZYMV), watermelon mosaic caused by Watermelon mosaic virus 2 (WMV2), and curly top caused by the Beet curly top virus (BCTV). The first two are potyviruses that are spread by aphids and by mechanical means such as equipment and pickers' hands and clothing. Aphids can move these viruses from weed hosts over relatively long distances. Curly top is restricted to production areas east of the Cascade Range. Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) also can be a problem; it is spread by aphids and cucumber beetles. CMV overwinters in wild cucumber seed and in wild perennial milkweed, ground cherry, and matrimonial vine.
These viral diseases first become noticeable in mid to late July, often following cutting of grass seed and alfalfa fields, which may displace aphid populations from these fields. Fewer infections tend to occur during wet summers. Infections generally begin at the edges of fields and move inward.


","Generally, it is difficult to tell ZYMV and WMV2 apart based only on symptoms. Serological testing is the best way to distinguish between them. Curly top; however, is easy to  differentiate from the two others.
ZYMV-a prominent yellow and green mosaic, necrosis, and a distortion called ""shoestring"" are on zucchini leaves. Early infection may result in no fruit set. Later fruit are severely distorted, small and green, and have yellow outgrowths.
WMV2-winter squash leaves range from faint green to a severe yellow mottle. Leaves are malformed, puckered, and blistered. Veins sometimes extend beyond the normal leaf margin. Plants may become bushy with shortened internodes. Fruit can look healthy or can develop knobby overgrowths that distort its shape. Summer squash symptoms are similar, but internode lengths  become extended, producing a leggy plant.
BCTV-plants appear stunted at first, then turn yellow and  eventually die. Fruit set or fruit development stops when the plant  becomes infected.
CMV-leaves are markedly mottled with yellow and green blotches and wrinkled; edges cup down. Early-season infection dwarfs the plant; later infections show the typical mosaic symptoms only on late-season growth following infection. Fruit develops raised, wart-like bumps with pale, whitish-green areas between.

1) Control weeds in the area around squash plantings.

2) Isolate squash plantings from one another if possible.

3) Clean equipment before moving into a healthy field. Try to allow pickers to get clean clothes before entering healthy fields.

4) There is resistance in some varieties to combinations of these viruses:

Statice ,(Limonium spp.)-Anthracnose,"Colletotrichum gloeosporioides (sexual: Glomerella cingulata), a fungus that survives on infected plants and plant debris. Some reports indicate the fungus may be seedborne. Wet weather and overhead irrigation favor the disease. Spores are produced in abundance within lesions. 'Gold Coast' is very susceptible.


","The crown and base of leaves decays; however, many leaves may still look healthy. Soon plants wilt, become somewhat yellow, and die. Sometimes symptoms may be on only one side of the plant. The tap root is unaffected until the crown completely rots. Symptoms often occur before flowering.
The fungus also can cause spots on leaves, flower stems, and flowers. Spots begin as small circular lesions. Tan to brown irregularly shaped spots with a yellow halo may also develop. Spotting may be so severe that flower stalks are girdled.

Statice ,(Limonium spp.)-Flower Blight,"Botrytis cinerea, a fungus that overwinters in infected plants and debris. A moist, humid environment is ideal for  pathogen sporulation and spread. Spore dispersal is stimulated by changes in relative hu-midity. Conidia may come from many sources. It is found everywhere plants are grown and has a wide host range. Flower petals are most susceptible at any stage of  development. Flower infections were light from 54°F to 60°F, moderate at 68°F, and heavy at 75°F. Leaf blights can start when infected floral tissue falls on healthy leaves.


","The showy membranous calyces and associated interior bracts collapse and become discolored. The disease proceeds rapidly through the compact flower clusters. As flowers dry out they drop from the inflorescence rachis. The uppermost extensions of the scape wings become infected and brown. The disease may continue down killing most of the branches of the panicle. Under moist conditions, the gray fuzzy growth of the fungus may be seen on necrotic tissues.
Large inflorescence branches may develop discrete lesions that may eventually girdle the branches. All parts of the plant distal to these lesions then die. Branch lesions are slightly depressed, tan to orange, up to 2 cm in length and show faint dark banding.

Statice ,(Limonium spp.)-Viruses,"Turnip mosaic virus has been reported from California for the perennial Limonium perezii. This disease has been sap- and aphid-transmitted to L. sinuatum. The disease spread rapidly, producing irregular patterns in the field. Several other viruses in Europe on the annual L. sinuatum include Broad bean wilt virus, Cucumber mosaic virus, Statice Y virus, Tobacco rattle virus, and Tomato bushy stunt virus. Carnation mottle virus and Clover yellow vein virus also are listed, but descriptions and distribution are unknown. Also, note that the aster yellows phytoplasma (Candidatus Phytoplasma asteris) can infect this host. Occurrence of these problems in the Pacific Northwest is unknown.


","Turnip mosaic virus-mosaic, stunting, and premature death of infected plants.
BBWV-stunted plants with small, puckered, twisted, wilted,  deformed leaves. Sometimes a mosaic pattern.
CMV-mosaic pattern on leaves sometimes combined with  distortion, red leaves, and reduced growth.
Statice Y -light green mosaic, stunting, and narrow or  deformed leaves.
TRV-bright yellow or red line patterns and ringspots on leaves.
TBSV-premature reddening of leaves, reduced yield, and small flower stalks.


","None have been tested, but the following may help.

1) Plant pathogen-free stock or seed from pathogen-free stock.

2) Minimize field operations to reduce mechanical transmission.

",,
Stock ,(Matthiola spp.)-Bacterial Blight,"Xanthomonas campestris pv. incanae, a bacterium that  persists in the soil, on or in seed. A vascular disease of the main stem and lateral branches. It often extends into leaf petioles and seed peduncles. Bacteria may be spread rapidly by splash from  irrigation water. Cool wet weather favors infection and disease  development. Yield losses of up to 90% have been experienced.


","Seedlings suddenly wilt when 2 to 4 inches tall. Stem tissues become yellowish, soft and mushy. A yellow exudate may occur along the stem but this is rare. On older plants, dark water soaked areas appear around leaf scars near ground level. The stem may become girdled and lower leaves show veinal necrosis, turn yellow and drop. Entire plants may wilt or become broken by wind at ground level.


","There seem to be few if any effective controls for this disease.

1) Treat seed with hot water (127°F to 131°F) for 10 min.  followed by rapid cooling. Unfortunately, this has a strong negative impact on seed germination.

2) Remove and destroy infected plants and debris.

3) Avoid splashing overhead irrigation.

4) Rotate planting beds for 2 to 3 years.

","Copper-based (Group M1 fungicides) or  phos acid-based (Group 33 fungicdes) products may be of some benefit. Several products may legally be used. Test first on a small section before applying on the whole plant to evaluate possible phytotoxicity.


",
Stock ,(Matthiola spp.)-Downy Mildew,,,,,
Strawberry ,(Fragaria spp.)-Alkali Yellows,"Alkali yellows is caused by strongly alkaline soil, which can make iron or manganese unavailable to plants. Although soil pH may be the main problem, iron could be lacking in the soil or in a form unavailable to plants. A frequent problem sent into the OSU Plant Clinic from areas east of the Cascade Range.


","Younger leaves show yellowing or lack of green chlorophyll between the veins. Veins tend to remain green in comparison. Interveinal areas may become slightly necrotic. New leaves continue to be small and may look white or bleached. Root volume is restricted and roots may be yellowish. No symptoms occur on flowers or fruit. Symptoms are similar for both iron or manganese deficiency.


","

1) Adjust soil pH to 6.2, which is optimal for strawberry.

2) Check plant's proximity to newly poured concrete. New concrete leaches lime into the surrounding soil, raising the pH.

3) Use iron chelate, either as a soil treatment or by foliar  feeding, to quickly help chlorotic plants. Read and follow  all label instructions.

",,
Strawberry ,(Fragaria spp.)-Anthracnose,"Several Colletotrichum spp. can cause various anthracnose diseases of strawberry. C. acutatum has been found by the OSU Plant Clinic. The diseases of fruit and crown rot were not a problem in the 1900's but were found more often in 2000's. This may be due to newer, more susceptible cultivars and/or the introduction of these fungi into the region. The cultivars Albion, Puget Reliance, and Sweet Bliss are susceptible.
Plants may be infected in the nursery and transported to production fields. The fungus may also survive in infected plants and plant  debris in perennial fields. Small infections on those plants  sporulate under very warm (greater than 68°F), wet, rainy  conditions and spread quickly to other plants. Young leaf petioles are more susceptible to infection than older petioles. Open flowers and ripening fruit are also very susceptible. Conditions in the  PNW are generally much cooler than 68°F. Between 40°F and 50°F the fungus will survive in plants causing few symptoms.  Continous wet periods of 8 hours or more favor disease  development. High nitrogen fertility also favors disease  development.


","All parts of the plant may be infected and show symptoms. Lesions on stolons and petioles begin as small, red streaks and rapidly develop into dark, sunken, firm, elongate lesions.  In humid, not wet, conditions pink spore masses may be seen in lesions. Petiole lesions may girdle the stem causing the leaf to wilt and die. Petiole lesions may also extend into the crown causing that to rot. Under high inoculum conditions, some cultivars will show a leaf spot but this has not been common in the PNW. Spots are small and round with black or gray centers.
Crown rot may first be detected by the wilting of the entire plant during hot weather. The youngest leaves may appear to recover but eventually the whole plant dies. Cutting the crown open reveals a reddish-brown firm rot or a reddish-brown streak. (Note that crowns will normally begin to redden after being cut and exposed to oxygen for several minutes in the absence of any fungal  infections.) The discolored rot will generally begin on one side  or portion of the crown.
Fruit rot, also called black spot, is common in the PNW and starts as light-brown, water-soaked spots on ripening fruit. These spots rapidly develop into firm, round lesions that turn dark-brown to black. Lesions may be covered with pink to orange colored spores under humid conditions. The fruit remains firm and eventually dries up to a hard mummy. But in most cases the fruit is invaded by a whole host of other organisms and rots quickly. On green fruit, the fungus may only invade an individual achene, which turns black and slightly sunken. Flowers may also blight back before forming any fruit.


","

1) Use certified plants only.

2) Space plants so foliage dries rapidly after rain and irrigation.

3) Use drip irrigation if possible. When using overhead irrigation, shorten sets and water at times that promote rapid drying of the foliage.

4) Use optimal fertilization.

5) Remove and destroy infected fruit from the field.

Strawberry ,(Fragaria spp.)-Armillaria Root Rot,,,,,
Strawberry ,(Fragaria spp.)-Black Root Rot Complex,"A complex interaction of many fungi, nematodes, and poor soil characteristics. Organisms or factors involved in one area may not be involved in others. Fungi associated with black root rot symptoms are Rhizoctonia fragariae, Paraconiothyrium fuckelii, Cylindrocarpon spp., Pilidium lythri (formerly Hainesia lythri), Idriella lunata, Pyrenochaeta sp., and Pythium spp. Research in Oregon in the 1930s and 1940s implicated Rhizoctonia sp.,  Fusarium spp., and Ramularia spp. with root rot of strawberry. (It is interesting that the authors of the original description of  I. lunata note its similarity to Ramularia.) Winter injury to  roots also reportedly encourages infection by Fusarium sp.  and Cylindrocarpon spp.
Some of these organisms are native soil fungi and survive indefinitely in soil. Root-lesion nematodes are frequently involved in root rot diseases such as black root rot. Consider that residual populations of root-lesion nematodes may be high in soils previously planted in legumes. Plants growing in sterile but saturated soil also will develop a black root rot. In addition, black roots can occur when roots dry out during transplanting.


","Symptoms include black discolorations on roots; the entire root or all but the core often darken, look unhealthy, and lack new growth. Foliage is reduced in size, has poor color, and wilts in warm weather. Although many roots rot away completely, they lack the red core discoloration typical of red stele.


","

1) Plant certified stock on well-drained fertile soil adapted to strawberry production.

2) While planting, keep roots from getting dry, and set plants at the proper depth.

3) Use long crop rotation in commercial plantings; include  grasses and grains in the rotation.

4) Preplant soil solarization has been helpful in reducing  populations of certain soilborne pathogens and weeds in  western Oregon. Place clear plastic (preferably anti-condensation film) directly on smooth, rototilled ground, which has been irrigated to field capacity and then allowed to drain for 1-2 days. Bury the edges of the plastic to trap the heat.  Solarize for 4-6 weeks (or longer) during the hottest part  of the summer, beginning in early- to mid-July. Use in  combination with other techniques.

5) Do not plant strawberries on land with a recent history of black root rot.

6) Plants with black root rot do not recover and should not be renovated.

","Preplant fumigation.


1) Basamid G. Avoid application when soil is over 90°F. Do not apply within 3 to 4 feet of growing plants. 5-day reentry

2) Paladin at 40 to 51.3 gal/A. Buffer zone from 40 to 690 feet depending on the rate used and acreage treated. 2- to 5-day entry-restriction period. See label for details.

3) Telone C-17 at 27 to 41 gal/A broadcast on mineral soils.  Allow 2 to 3 weeks between application and planting or until odor leaves the soil. Do not treat extremely heavy soils.  5-day reentry.

4) Vapam HL at 37.5 to 75 gal/A. Immediately roll the soil and follow up with tarps or a light watering. May use through an irrigation system. 5-day reentry

5) When Aliette (Group 33 fungicides) are used to control red stele, there also appears to be a reduction in root damage from some of the fungi in this complex. This is based only on a few field observations and not published research results.

",
Strawberry ,(Fragaria spp.)-Charcoal Rot,"Macrophomina phaseolina is a soilborne fungus that is favored by dry and warm soil conditions and has an extensive host range. Disease development is enhanced by high temperature, soil water deficit, strawberry monoculture, and sandy soils. The fungus produces microsclerotia for long-term survival and dispersal in the soil. Microsclerotia in the soil infect new strawberry plants each season. The microsclerotia are produced in the host tissue and released into the soil as the infected plant decays. The disease is on the increase in California and Florida strawberry industries on fields that have not been fumigated. First found in southern Oregon in 2014.


","Plants in discrete patches in the field show wilting of foliage, drying and death of older leaves, plant stunting, and eventual collapse and death. When plant crowns are cut open, internal vascular and cortex tissues are dark brown to orange brown. May look similar to Fusarium or Verticillium wilt.


","

1) Plant certified stock on well-drained fertile soil adapted to strawberry production.

2) While planting, keep roots from getting dry, and set plants at the proper depth.

3) Use long crop rotation in commercial plantings; include  grasses and grains in the rotation.

4) Anaerobic Soil Disinfestation may be helpful even in the PNW. First rice bran is incorporated into the soil followed  by irrigated to near field capacity. Then place clear oxygen  impermeable plastic (such as anti-condensation film) on  the prepared ground. This summer treatment needs to reach soil temperatures of 90°F.

Strawberry ,(Fragaria spp.)-Common Leaf Spot,"Ramularia grevilleana (sexual: Mycosphaerella fragariae), a fungus that overwinters on old infected leaves and as sclerotia.  Conidia are produced abundantly in lesions on infected leaves. Sclerotia in dead leaf material produce conidia in the spring.  Conidia are rain-splashed to healthy tissues. Only young leaf  tissue is susceptible to infection and then, only after a minimum of 12 hours of leaf wetness. Long wet periods (several days) and warm temperatures (over 50°F) favor disease development in the spring and in summer after renovation. Several physiologic races of the fungus have been identified. 'Olympus', 'Puget Reliance' and 'Shuksan' are very susceptible.


","Foliage is at first dark red or purplish, gradually becoming grayish or almost white with age. Fully developed spots are about 0.12 inch in diameter, with a whitish center and reddish margin. They are scattered widely over the leaf surface, reducing leaf function. Infections occur in moist weather and are most  severe in spring and fall.
The fungus also can infect fruit in what is called black seed disease. Berries usually have one or two spots but may have as many as 10. Spots are brownish black, hard, and leathery and appear on one to several achenes. Fruit does not rot but discolors under the spot.


","

1) Removing foliage after harvest reduces inoculum in the field. Mow leaves of June-bearing plants 0.5 inch above the crown after harvest. Do not mow everbearing or day-neutral types. Leaf spot can still be a problem after renovation unless  supplemented with chemical protection.

Strawberry ,(Fragaria spp.)-Crown Rot,"The fungal-like organism Phytophthora cactorum causes a rot of the strawberry crown. It appears to be different from the same fungus that causes leather rot. Oospores form in old crown tissue and survive long periods in the soil. In the spring under saturated soil conditions, zoospores are formed that infect through wounds. The disease is favored by warm temperatures and wet conditions. The cultivar Sweet Bliss appears to be very susceptible.


","Young leaves may become off-colored and wilt suddenly. The entire plant may wilt soon after, collapse and die. If the plant is pulled out the crown breaks leaving the main crown and roots in the ground. The vascular system of the crown is discolored with dark shades of brown. Roots remain healthy if this is the only problem with the plant.

Strawberry ,(Fragaria spp.)-Gray Mold (Fruit Rot),"Botrytis cinerea, a fungus that overwinters as sclerotia or dormant mycelia in old leaves, petioles, and mummified fruit. Plants from nurseries can also be a source of fungi including ones that are resistant to fungicides. Conidia from within the planting are the principal inoculum and are produced readily and for a long time on diseased plant material. Conidia may infect leaves but infections generally remain symptomless until the leaf dies. Conidia readily infect the petals, stamens and pistils but not sepals. Flowers are most susceptible at anthesis. Mycelium then invades the developing fruit. Symptoms are generally delayed until fruit maturity and then progresses rapidly. No cultivar is immune, and even the least susceptible sustain considerable losses when environmental conditions favor disease development. The disease is more severe in high-density, double-row beds and with day neutral cultivars.


","Blossom blight is characterized by petals and pedicels that turn brown. The entire blossom may die. Fruit rot symptoms may occur on any portion of the fruit. They frequently develop at the calyx end and in tissues contiguous with rotting fruit or diseased flowers. Affected tissue turns light to medium brown. Lesions in green or white fruit develop slowly. The fruit may be misshapen as it enlarges. Fruit rot expands rapidly near harvest. In advanced stages, the fungus produces a gray fungal growth over the fruit surface. Rot may not develop until after fruit is harvested.


","

1) Space plants so foliage dries rapidly after rain and irrigation.

2) Use drip irrigation if possible. When using overhead irrigation, shorten sets and water at times that promote rapid drying of the foliage.

3) Pick fruit as it ripens and move it quickly to cold storage.

4) Shorten picking intervals, if possible, when weather favors .

5) After harvest, apply 10-10-10 (or equivalent well-balanced  fertilizer) at 2 to 3 lb/100 feet of row.

6) Time of renovation is important because fall fruit can provide considerable inoculum for the next growing season. In Oregon, it is recommended to renovate 2 to 4 weeks after the last  harvest of June bearing types.

7) Remove blossoms in the planting year.

8) Under annual production in Florida it was found that removal of senescent, dead leaves reduced the amount of gray mold but did not improve overall yield. Removal of diseased fruit during harvest did not reduce gray mold or increase yield.

9) A 1 minute treatment of short-wave ultraviolet light (UV-C) followed by at least a 4 hour dark period resulted in less  disease and may be useful in the greenhouse or tunnel  production.

10) Heat treatment of transplants prior to planting may be useful in some situations. Preheat plants at 99°F for an hour then move to 111°F for 4 hours.

","Apply during bloom period. Start at first bloom; repeat at regular intervals, especially during wet weather. Applications during fruit ripening are of questionable value. Without floral applications, fruit ripening applications are worthless. With floral applications, data are incomplete on the value of fruit ripening sprays. Several forecasting programs are available to help time  applications (see below).
Fungal strains can become resistant to a fungicide when it is used exclusively in a spray schedule. To prevent developing resistant fungi, alternate or tank-mix materials from different groups with different modes of action. Alternating resistance-sensitive products with multi-site products, such as M3 or M4 fungicides, is recommended. Also, limit applications from any specific group to two (2) or fewer sprays. Strains resistant to many different modes of action have been reported from the Eastern US as well as Germany and China. The frequency in the population is low but it is not uncommon to find strains resistant to 1 to 4 modes of action in the same isolate. Fitness of these fungi that are resistant to multiple classes of fungicide is lower than wild-type sensitive isolates.
It has been suggested that fungicides used in nursery production should be different from those used for fruit production. Nurseries should consider the use of more multi-site materials rather than those at risk for resistance development.

Strawberry ,(Fragaria spp.)-Leaf Scorch,"Diplocarpon fragarie, a fungus that overwinters on old  infected leaves. The disease is frequent in northern Idaho and  western Oregon and Washington. Conidia are produced in  acervuli and are splashed to healthy tissue. Conidia are sticky  and can directly penetrate the leaf cuticle. In spring rains, spores from just a few diseased plants can multiply and spread through the entire planting. Generally more severe in second- and third-year fields.


","Small, dark purple spots develop on upper leaf  surfaces and remain dark purple. A white center never forms,  as with common leaf spot. Spots have an irregular outline. If  numerous, spots run together, and leaves appear scorched. In  severe cases, foliage is reduced considerably, and plants may  be stunted. Infected fruit has elongated, slightly sunken, reddish areas or streaks, but the marks disappear as the fruit ripens.

Strawberry ,(Fragaria spp.)-Leather Rot,"The fungal-like organism Phytophthora cactorum causes  a subtle fruit rot of strawberry that imparts off flavors and smells  in both fresh and processed berries.  It appears to be different  from the same fungus that causes crown rot. Oospores form in mummified fruit. They can also survive long periods in the soil.  In the spring under saturated wet conditions, new spores are  transferred to fruit by rain splash, overhead irrigation, or free-swimming zoospores. Fruit can be infected at any stage of  development. New spores are produced in as little as 5 days after infection under warm (greater than 50°F), wet conditions.


","Green fruit will have areas of dark-brown lesions that eventually spreads to the whole berry. The texture of the infected berry appears leathery. Mature fruit may turn brown to dark-purple or may not change in color much at all. The vascular tissue to each seed is darkened. In advanced stages of decay the fruit becomes tough and leathery. All infected fruits dry down to a hard mummy. Infected fruit has a diagnostic unpleasant odor and taste.


","

1) Improve drainage of soil before planting so there is no  standing water.

2) Plant on beds raised 8 to 10 inches to improve drainage, or use drain furrows. In home gardens or small plantings, raise the bed 15 inches.

3) Preplant soil solarization has been helpful in reducing  populations of certain soilborne pathogens and weeds in  western Oregon. Place clear plastic (preferably anti-condensation film) directly on smooth, rototilled ground, which has been irrigated to field capacity and then allowed to drain for 1-2 days. Bury the edges of the plastic to trap the heat.  Solarize for 4-6 weeks (or longer) during the hottest part of the summer, beginning in early- to mid-July. Use in  combination with other techniques.

4) Do not plant in draws or swales where surface water flows after heavy rains.

5) Chisel or subsoil 18- to 20-inches deep between rows in late fall to increase drainage.

6) Use of straw mulch is beneficial to prevent fruit from touching the soil and spores from splashing on fruit.

Strawberry ,"(Fragaria spp.)-Nematode, Dagger","Xiphinema americanum and related species are vectors of Tomato ringspot virus. Dagger nematodes are migratory ectoparasites found only in soil. As virus vectors, they can be damaging at very low population levels. Dagger nematode populations may be very low in late summer when other nematodes are abundant.


","In the absence of the virus, the nematodes may cause sunken reddish brown lesions on roots. Feeding can reduce the root system, which can stunt growth and reduce runner production.


","

1) Use certified planting stock.

2) Plant on soil tested and found free of dagger nematodes.

3) In areas with dagger nematodes, consider planting tolerant or resistant cultivars such as Northwest.

4) Fallow periods can disrupt the nematode life cycle. Practice good weed control using herbicides or tillage.

5) Cover crops are an excellent way to disrupt the nematode life cycle. Care should be taken when selecting a cover crop to avoid use of a plant that is a host for the target nematode.  Dagger nematode has a narrow host range so there are more cover crop options available to manage this nematode. Part  of an effective cover crop is good weed control.

Strawberry ,"(Fragaria spp.)-Nematode, Root-lesion","Pratylenchus penetrans and P. crenatus, nematodes that live in soil. The nematodes migrate through and feed in the root cortex. The surrounding root tissue dies and can be seen as discrete lesions. Legumes such as clover, alfalfa, and vetch often harbor large populations of root-lesion nematodes, which may affect future strawberry plantings. The number of nematodes in the soil can be a rough guide to possible plant damage. Factors such as crop age, planting frequency, presence of other diseases and pests, and adverse growing conditions influence the effect of certain nematode populations on plant growth. In some cases, 300 nematodes/100 g of soil affect plant growth, but much higher populations often have little effect. Root-lesion nematodes are migratory endoparasites; part of the population is in soil and part in the roots at all times.

Strawberry ,(Fragaria spp.)-Powdery Mildew,"Podosphaera aphanis var. aphanis (formerly Sphaerotheca macularis f. sp. fragariae), a fungus that overwinters on infected plant tissue including living leaves. This fungus is favored by conditions that produce high humidity but dry leaves. Conidia are able to begin germination after 6 hours and complete it within 24 hours, irrespective of temperature. Lesion expansion is related to temperature but does not seem to be related to relative humidity. Only the youngest leaf or fruit tissue is susceptible to infection. As leaves and fruit age they rapidly become resistant to infection. Spore germination, hyphal growth, haustoria formation, colony expansion, and sporulation are all reduced while the latent period increases as the plant tissue matures. Cultivars with leaves that emerge folded generally have more disease on the underside of the leaf as it is exposed to inoculum while susceptible. The upper surfaces are exposed to inoculum as they become more resistant to infection. Fruit becomes resistant to infection 10 to 15 days after bloom (about white stage).
Powdery mildew fungi are highly specialized pathogens that form a close association with the host. Conditions that favor the host also favor the pathogen. Much of the fungus remains outside infected plant parts where it grows on the surface but sinks root-like structures called haustoria into plant cells to obtain nutrients. The white growth seen is composed of both mycelium and fungal spores. Cleistothecia may form within the colonies late in the growing season, stay associated with the overwintering leaves and shed mature sexual spores in the spring when plant growth resumes.
'Hood', 'Totem', and 'Benton' are moderately resistant or tolerant to mildew; 'Shuksan', 'Sumas', and 'Linn' are moderately susceptible; 'Olympus', 'Redcrest', 'Independence', 'Puget Summer', 'Firecracker', 'Whonnock' and 'Northwest' are very susceptible. The powdery mildew of raspberry does not infect strawberry and that of strawberry does not infect raspberry despite the similar name.


","Edges of infected leaflets curl up, exposing undersides that often are reddened and coated with a grayish-white powdery fungal growth. Diseased leaves later turn purplish or red. In  irrigated fields, the fungus also may attack fruit. Some day-neutral cultivars are susceptible to fruit infection in fall even though leaves may appear healthy.


","

1) Destroying old leaves by renovating plants after harvest may help reduce inoculum.

2) Plant resistant cultivars.

3) Frequent overhead irrigation for short periods may help  remove conidia and reduce disease pressure. Do not irrigate such that leaves are wet for extended periods of time.

4) A 3- to 6-minute treatment of medium-wave ultraviolet light (UV-B) during every night combined with reflective surfaces resulted in less disease and may be useful in the greenhouse or tunnel production.

","The disease needs to be controlled on highly susceptible cultivars after summer renovation so plants remain  vigorous until they cease growth and go dormant in late fall.  Powdery mildew on most cultivars grown in the PNW does  not seem to impact yield the next year. Therefore, growers have  not typically managed this disease after harvest. Many of these products, such as soaps, oils and sulfurs, may influence mite  problems in the field. Some could influence gray mold fungicide resistance. Alternate or tank-mix products from different groups that have different modes of action. Resistance to Group 3  fungicides has been reported.

Strawberry ,(Fragaria spp.)-Red Stele,"Phytophthora fragariae var. fragariae, a soil-infesting  fungus-like microorganism that may live many years in fields. It is active in cool, wet weather. It attacks roots soon after fall rains begin and remains active through winter, spreading most rapidly where drainage is poor or in heavier soils. Well-drained fields  are less often attacked, but low areas often show typical red stele infection.
Several races of the fungus-like microorganism have been reported. A cultivar resistant in one field may be susceptible in another field due to the presence of different races. Of the seven races described, five have been reported from Oregon and Washington. Cultivars used to determine races include Aberdeen, Climax,  Stelemaster, Sure-crop, Tennessee Beauty, MD-683, and a clone  of F. chiloensis 'Del Norte'.


","The core or stele of diseased roots in winter and spring has a reddish pink tinge gradually turning a cinnamon-brown while the root's outer cortex stays white. Ultimately the diseased core turns black. Most of the plant's main roots show the symptom, but after May it is difficult to see. Cut roots lengthwise to expose the core. Lateral roots are quickly destroyed, giving main roots a ""rat tail"" appearance. As the disease progresses and active spring growth begins, infected plants are undernourished. Aboveground symptoms depend on the extent of root damage. Slightly diseased plants show few symptoms, if any. Severely diseased plants are stunted, and under certain conditions the youngest leaves take on  a bluish-green tinge and lack normal glossiness. Older leaves  generally turn red, orange, or yellow. Such plants eventually wilt and die.


","

1) Use certified plants only.

2) Set new plants in well-drained soil (no standing water in  winter) where red stele has not been known.

3) Plant on beds raised 8 to 10 inches to improve drainage, or use drain furrows. In home gardens or small plantings, raise the bed 15 inches.

4) Preplant soil solarization has been helpful in reducing  populations of certain soilborne pathogens and weeds in  western Oregon. Place clear plastic (preferably anti-condensation film) directly on smooth, rototilled ground, which has been irrigated to field capacity and then allowed to drain for 1-2 days. Bury the edges of the plastic to trap the heat.  Solarize for 4-6 weeks (or longer) during the hottest part of the summer, beginning in early- to mid-July. Use in combination with other techniques.

5) Do not plant in draws or swales where surface water flows after heavy rains.

6) Chisel or subsoil 18 to 20 inches deep between rows in late fall to increase drainage.

7) Clean soil from equipment before using it in other fields.

8) Resistant cultivars such as Olympus, Hood, Totem, Rainier, and Shuksan are available, but even these are infected sometimes if virulent races of the pathogen are in soil.

","Research data are based on chemical programs initiated at planting. Curative treatments may give some benefit but are not recommended. Alternate between chemicals with different modes of action to prevent or delay building up resistant microorganisms. Red stele microorganisms resistant to Ridomil have been detected in the major strawberry-growing areas of the Willamette Valley of Oregon.

Strawberry ,(Fragaria spp.)-Slime Mold,,,,,
Strawberry ,(Fragaria spp.)-Verticillium Wilt,"Verticillium dahliae, a soilborne fungus that can live many years in soil. The fungus grows into the xylem where it colonizes the plant through mycelial growth and conidial production. Fluid movement in the xylem passively transports the conidia. Once in the xylem, this fungus partially blocks water movement and produces toxins that result in wilt symptoms. Isolates that can attack strawberry have a wide host range, so it is not advisable to plant strawberry after solanaceous (potato family) or small fruit crops that have shown evidence of the disease. Many cultivars derived from resistant clones of Fragaria chiloensis, F. virginiana, and  F. virginiana subsp. glauca are resistant to strains of Verticillium.


","Individual plants wilt, sometimes in patches in the field. It is often confused with other root and crown rots, winter injury, and Tomato ringspot virus infection in cultivars such as Olympus. Plants are most severely affected in their first year.
Older leaves wilt and tend to curl up along the midvein. Inner (younger) leaves tend to remain green although stunted. Plants often are stunted, dry, and flattened with small yellowish leaves, especially as fruit ripens. Brownish streaks occur in vascular tissue of crown roots or at the base of the petiole.


","

1) Plant only healthy, certified berry stock from nurseries or other plantings known to be free of wilt.

2) The fungus may persist many years in soil and can attack susceptible plants' roots whenever they are placed in infested ground. Rotating to nonsusceptible grasses and cereals may lower the amount of in infested soil but seldom eliminates it. Rotations of 5 to 8 years have been tried, though often survives longer in soil. Rotations with broccoli and/or Brussels sprouts followed by incorporation of the crop residue for 2 years prior to planting strawberry resulted in reduced disease incidence in California.

3) Anaerobic Soil Disinfestation may be helpful even in the PNW. First rice bran is incorporated into the soil followed  by irrigated to near field capacity. Then place clear oxygen  impermeable plastic (such as anti-condensation film) on  the prepared ground. This summer treatment needs to reach soil temperatures of 90F. Use in combination with other  techniques.

4) Remove infected plants and the plants on either side to stop wilt spread. Do not replant where infection occurred.

5) Do not track soil from infested areas into clean areas. Clean boots, equipment, and tools before leaving an infested area.

6) Avoid rotations with other susceptible crops, which may  increase  in the soil. Susceptible crops include  potato, tomato, caneberries, eggplant, and pepper; also maple among other nursery trees, and many common weeds.

7) Use resistant cultivars.

","Preplant fumigation.


1) Telone C-17 at 27 to 41 gal/A broadcast on mineral soils.  Allow 2 to 3 weeks between application and planting or until odor leaves soil. Do not treat extremely heavy soils.  5-day reentry.

2) Vapam HL at 37.5 to 75 gal/A. Immediately roll the soil and follow up with tarps or a light watering. May use through an irrigation system. 5-day reentry

Strawberry ,(Fragaria spp.)-Virus Diseases,"Cultivars of strawberry that have become important in the PNW are tolerant to infection with multiple aphid-transmitted viruses, except Hood. Strawberry crinkle virus, Strawberry mottle virus, Strawberry mild yellow-edge virus, and Strawberry vein-banding virus commonly infect strawberry plants in the Pacific Northwest. These viruses are transmitted by the common strawberry aphid, Chaetosiphon fragaefolii. Tomato ringspot virus (TRsV) is spread by the dagger nematode, Xiphinema americanum, and related species. Tobacco streak virus and pallidosis disease also  are in Pacific Northwest strawberry fields. Strawberry pallidosis associated virus is whitefly transmitted.
More than 30 viruses and virus-like diseases have been reported in strawberry. Before bringing plants into the Pacific Northwest from other areas, be aware of the viruses in those areas. New virus problems could be inadvertently introduced and cause major losses.


","There are few if any diagnostic symptoms of specific viruses in our common Northwest cultivars. Some general  symptoms are described below.
TRsV-stunting and sometimes death. Susceptible Pacific Northwest cultivars are Benton, Hood, Olympus, Puget Beauty, Rainier, Shuksan, and Totem. 'Northwest' appears to be immune.
Aphid-transmitted viruses-vigor and yield decrease, but usually the only distinctive symptoms are dwarfing, leaf cupping, and  yellowing. The cultivars Totem, Shuswap, and Sumas are the  most virus tolerant; Hood is the most sensitive. The former  cultivars become infected as readily as others but usually do  not show symptoms unless infected by three of the viruses.
Tobacco streak virus-loss of vigor and yield without distinctive symptoms.
Pallidosis-symptoms are not severe alone but pallidosis increases the severity of many aphid-transmitted viruses when they infect a plant at the same time. Stunted plant growth, purple or red coloration of older leaves and brittle roots. Leaves eventually dry out and plants die. New leaves may look okay as they develop at times when the virus titer is not high.


","

1) Use planting stock that is certified as tested and free of all known viruses.

2) Do not set out new plants next to old, virus-infected fields.

3) Use cultivars that are tolerant to viruses.

4) Control known insect vectors. Aphid flights peak in late  April to early May and again in September-the most  critical periods for controlling aphid vectors. See the  for details.

Sugar Beet ,(Beta vulgaris)-Bacterial Vascular Necrosis and Rot (Erwinia Root Rot),"This disease is caused by a bacterium, Erwinia carotovora subsp. betavasculorum, present in many native and cultivated soils. This pathogen can survive in some weedy hosts. Portions of the bacterium that causes potato blackleg can be pathogenic to sugar beets. Plant wounding, excessive nitrogen or moisture, and warm temperatures (optimum is 79°F to 82°F) favor disease development. The disease occasionally is severe in Idaho.


","Black streaks may be found on petioles, and crowns may be blackened or produce froth. Vascular bundles are brown, and adjacent tissue turns pink when cut and exposed to air. Rot can become extensive soft or dry rot.


","Most sugar beet varieties have resistance, but losses still can occur.

By J. Gallian and C. M. Ocamb

1) Maintain a 6- to 8-inch plant spacing, which helps to keep soil cooler.

2) Minimize plant injury.

3) Avoid excessive nitrogen.

4) Avoid excessive irrigation.

5) When hilling, avoid pushing soil into the crowns.

",,
Sugar Beet ,(Beta vulgaris)-Beet Curly Top,"The Beet curly top virus is spread in North America only by the beet leafhopper (Circulifer tenellus). The virus has an  extensive host range. The leafhopper breeds readily on mustards and overwinters in perennial or winter annual weed hosts, carrying the virus to beets and other crops in spring.


","Young leaves roll in, pucker, develop blister-like  thickenings, and are dwarfed. Vein clearing appears in young leaves followed by vein swellings on the lower sides, which appear knotted or gall-like. Roots are dwarfed, and rootlets may be twisted and distorted. Tap roots are covered with many rootlets (""hairy root""). Young plants die quickly.


","Planting resistant cultivars is the most  effective control practice. Minimum curly top resistance standards for approved varieties have been established by the Snake River Sugarbeet Research and Seed Committee for the Amalgamated Sugar Company growing areas of Idaho, Oregon and Washington.
By J. Gallian and C. M. Ocamb

",,
Sugar Beet ,(Beta vulgaris)-Beet Mosaic,"Beet mosaic virus (BMV), which overwinters in infected members of the beet family including red beets. The virus is spread by many aphid species but persists in the aphid vectors only a  few hours. Therefore, the virus moves fairly short distances from infected plants. The host range for BMV includes the families  Chenopodiaceae, Solanaceae, and Leguminosae. Because  overlapping beet crops are not grown in the Pacific Northwest, Beet mosaic virus has not been observed to cause economic loss  in this area.


","Young leaves have yellowish, circular spots, often yellowish rings with green centers. Leaves appear puckered and mottled with light and dark green areas. Plants are stunted.


","

1) Eliminate overwintering hosts, both escaped and wild.

2) Plant to avoid migrating aphids.

",,
Sugar Beet ,(Beta vulgaris)-Cercospora Leaf Spot,"Cercospora beticola, a fungus perpetuated in beet refuse. It can be spread on seed produced in regions where the disease is severe. It is not a major disease in the Pacific Northwest but occasionally causes serious leaf spot, especially under sprinkler irrigation. Other crop hosts include red beet, mangel, spinach, and Swiss chard; weedy hosts include redroot pigweed, lambsquarter, mallow, and bindweed. No resistant cultivars have been adapted for the Pacific Northwest. High humidity or free moisture and high temperatures (77°F to 95°F days, nights above 60°F) favor infection. Under humid conditions, conidia form on infected crop residue and are carried by wind or rain to host leaves. Spore production is optimal at 68°F to 79°F and 90% to 100% relative humidity. Disease can develop and spread, though more slowly, under a wider range of conditions.


","Numerous circular spots about 0.12 inch in diameter with tan to gray centers and dark brown to reddish purple-brown borders appear on leaves. The disease begins on older leaves but also appears on younger leaves as it progresses. In humid weather, spots may have a gray to steel-blue fuzzy appearance as spores  are produced. Petioles also are affected. If spots are numerous,  the entire leaf tends to wither and die prematurely, resulting in  defoliation that reduces root growth and yield.


","

1) Plant at least 300 ft from last season's plantings.

2) Do not replant on the same land for 3 years.

3) Plow deeply to completely bury infected refuse.

4) If leaf spot is serious, reduce planting density.

5) Irrigate so plants dry by night.

","Sprays usually are not required if crops are rotated. Early disease detection and monitoring is essential to prevent economic loss. It is recommended that the field be sprayed when disease averages 0.5% infection (about 12 spots per leaf). Economic loss occurs if leaf spots cover at least 3% of the foliage by harvest (about 80 spots per leaf). To minimize fungicide resistance, rotate fungicides, apply them only as needed, and follow cultural control recommendations.

Sugar Beet ,(Beta vulgaris)-Damping-off,"The soilborne fungi or fungus-like microorganisms, Pythium spp., Rhizoctonia solani, and Aphanomyces cochlioides, may attack before, during, and after germination. In the Pacific Northwest, Pythium spp. are the major cause of pre- and post-emergence damping-off of young seedlings. Pythium ultimum is the primary species and is favored by cool soil temperatures. Rhizoctonia solani is more often associated with post-emergence damping-off of older seedlings and can be a problem when the crop is replanted due to loss by frost or other causes and soil temperatures are warm; it is favored by warmer soil temperatures. Aphanomyces cochlioides causes post-emergence damping off and is favored by wet soils. These fungi can survive several years in soil and can infect other plant species including beans and other legumes, including some weed species.


","Seeds either do not emerge, or emerged seedlings  often develop blackened stems and wilt. Very few infected  seedlings survive.


","

1) Encourage rapid emergence by managing planting depth  (shallow), timing, and soil moisture. Work soil at moisture conditions that reduce soil compaction.

2) Rotate beet crops with grass and grain.

3) Placing phosphate fertilizer in a band one inch below seed  often prevents damping-off.

4) If the stand is lost, replant ideally in dry, warm weather, which is more favorable for germination.

Sugar Beet ,(Beta vulgaris)-Downy Mildew,"The fungus-like microorganism, Peronospora farinosa f. sp. betae (formerly P. schachtii) , causes disease on sugar beet  for seed mostly west of the Cascade Range. The microorganism survives in infected crop residues and in wild or volunteer Beta spp. It can also survive in seed to a limited extent. Optimal temperatures for infection are between 45°F and 59°F; little infection occurs above 68°F.


","All aboveground plant parts may be affected. Large, light green leaf spots develop on the upper leaf surfaces. Under moist conditions, a white to gray mold appears on the lower or  upper leaf surfaces. Affected leaves may wilt, and then die. If  environmental conditions become unfavorable for downy mildew, plants may show recovery by developing healthy leaves, or other pathogens may be encouraged. During fall wet periods, most young petioles or leaves are covered with a fungal growth that often moves into the crown. Crown infections may permit other root-decay organisms to invade the plant. Crown infection causes excessive leaf proliferation, which in turn causes misshapen bulbs.
In beet seed crops, systemic crown infections of stecklings may result in severe stand and seed yield losses. Flower and seed heads can be attacked directly with serious losses of seed production.

Sugar Beet ,"(Beta vulgaris)-Nematode, Beet Cyst","Heterodera schachtii is a sedentary endoparasite with a relatively small host range. Other crop hosts are mangel-wurzel, table beet, cabbage, cauliflower, Brussels sprouts, broccoli, rape, turnip, rutabaga, and radish. Weed hosts are dock, knotweed, lambsquarters, mustard, nightshade, purslane, saltbush, and red root. Any of these that overwinter may be reservoirs for the pests and may counteract much of the value of crop rotation.


","Beets are stunted in small, conspicuous areas of the field. Infected beets are much smaller than normal ones. Often they have a dense system of secondary roots called hairy-root condition. Use a hand lens to examine rootlets and the tap root; usually you can see numerous small, white, bead-like or lemon-shaped structures that later become egg cysts. Pull dwarfed beets that tend to wilt in warm weather and examine them for small, white, bead-like females. Later in the season, areas of nematode infestation often are marked by absence of beets and presence of weed patches.


","

1) Use a 2- to 6-year crop rotation. Slight infestations may require only a 2-year interval, but severe infestations require a 5- to 6-year interval. Crops that may be in a short-term rotation are beans, sweet clover, corn, grains, peas, potatoes, and tomatoes. Alfalfa is suitable for a long rotation period.

Sugar Beet ,(Beta vulgaris)-Rhizoctonia Root and Crown Rot,"Rhizoctonia solani is a fungus that survives primarily as mycelium or sclerotia in plant debris. Rhizoctonia solani becomes active when soil is 77°F to 91°F, attacking any part of the root or crown area. The fungus is favored by poor soil structure and high soil moisture. Moisture or nutritional stress or injuries can predispose the crop to infection by R. solani. This pathogen can also cause post-emergence damping-off, resulting in reduced stands. Root and crown rot will result in smaller beets, and increased tare dockage from rotted beets in tare samples.


","Leaves of individual or groups of plants wilt during the heat of the day but recover partially in cool periods. Leaves may retain their color for a time but turn yellow and die. After severe daytime wilting, often the leaf petiole base darkens and the crown rots. Petioles remain attached to the crown and their base will have dark lesions. Symptoms may be observed as early as mid-June. Symptoms in July, August, and September are darkened petioles, crown rot, rotted or discolored roots, and dying plants.  Severely infected roots may be a russeted brown or a dark brown to black. In some instances, rot may be restricted to dark circular areas on the root. The root may be cracked or intact; it appears to be rotted, but inside considerable tissue can appear firm and healthy.


","The most effective management is to promote good crop growth and avoid plant stress.

1) Do not plant sugar beet crops consecutively. A 3-year rotation is the minimum; lengthen to 4 to 5 years if root rot is a problem. Shortened rotations in affected fields are associated with increased losses and a build-up of pathogen populations that make future control more difficult.

2) Plan a cropping sequence that maintains organic matter and nutrition and controls weeds and beet-cyst nematodes.  Precede sugar beets with corn or cereals, and incorporate crop residue uniformly distributed through the soil profile, ensuring adequate decomposition. Alfalfa, beans, or potatoes should  not precede sugar beets; severe root rot has been observed  following these crops.

3) Supply adequate nutrition as needed, but avoid excess  nitrogen.

4) Fall bed when feasible.

5) Provide moisture as needed, but avoid over-irrigating throughout the growing season. Optimum soil moisture for sugar beet growth is between -40 and -60 centibars (cbars) soil matric potential.

6) Control soil compaction.

7) When hilling, avoid pushing soil into the crowns because the petiole and crown are the point where most pathogens infect.

8) Maintain a 6- to 8-inch plant spacing. This helps to keep soil cooler.

Sugar Beet ,(Beta vulgaris)-Rhizomania,"A virus (Beet necrotic yellow vein virus) transmitted by a fungus (Polymyxa betae) commonly found in soil. The disease was first detected in Idaho, Wyoming, and Nebraska in 1992. Infection often begins in low areas where soil moisture is high. Root yield and sucrose content may be drastically reduced in infected plants. The fungus vector may survive in infested soil 10 years or more without significant loss in viability. Anything that moves soil (farm equipment, people, irrigation water, tare dirt, wind, livestock and other animals) can spread the disease.


","Rhizomania literally is ""root madness"" or ""crazy root."" Diseased plants usually are grouped in spots or areas rather than scattered. Root symptoms include a mass of fine, hairy, mostly dead roots surrounding the taproot. As the plant ages, primarily crown tissue continues to grow while the taproot does not, giving the root a large crown and a wineglass shape. Root proliferation gives it a bearded appearance. Vascular rings darken, and, in longitudinal section, darkened vascular tissue is somewhat translucent. Late-season infections may be more difficult to recognize because the fungus infects only young roots. Lateral roots may have only a tuft of fine-hair roots, and the only discoloration is in the lateral root's vascular system where the infection is. Foliage symptoms may include general, slight chlorosis (yellowing), which may  revert to normal color later in the season; wilting without foliage discoloration; erect leaf growth; raised veins on leaf undersides; elongated leaf shape; abnormally large number of leaves; and stunted growth. Rarely, plants may show pronounced veinal  chlorosis (yellowing) and necrosis.


","

1) Clean anything that moves soil such as farm equipment,  people, irrigation water, tare dirt, and livestock, if possible.

2) Varieties adapted to the Pacific Northwest having moderate rhizomania resistance and moderate curly top virus resistance are available. After rhizomania has been detected, resistant varieties should be planted to minimize increase in soil inoculum. Planting resistant varieties on a minimum 4-year rotation, along with avoiding soil moisture wetter than -40 centibars (cbars) can result in good yields.

3) Maintain good weed control in rotation crops.

4) Prevent soil compaction and maintain good drainage.

This fungus can grow under a wide range of temperatures, but 59°F to 68°F with relative humidity above 80% is most conducive to disease development. Spores can be moved by air, rain splash, or equipment.


","Early symptoms are numerous small, circular white to yellow spots, beginning on older leaves and progressing to younger ones. Spots often join together and then are irregularly shaped. When the fungus produces spores, spots change to an olive-black. Generally, older leaves die, but in severe infections all leaves may die and seed may be affected.

Swiss Chard ,(Beta vulgaris subsp. cicla)-Phoma Leaf Spot and Root Rot,"The fungus, Pleospora bjoerlingii (syn. P. betae = Phoma betae) can cause leaf spots and root rot of table beet, sugar beet, Swiss chard, and other Beta species. The fungus is seedborne. During the spring time, windblown ascospores are released from sexual fruiting bodies (pseudothecia) which developed the previous season on infected plant debris remaining on the soil surface. Asexual fruiting bodies known as pycnidia develop in the center of leaf spots as well as in lesions on petioles, stems, and upper tap roots. Pycnidiospores (conidia) produced by pycnidia can be moved by water splash, or equipment, tools, or workers moving through infected fields when wet. Temperatures between 57°F and 65°F with high humidity are optimum for disease. Rains close to harvest in infected seed fields will increase the occurrence of  infected seeds.


","Infected seed result in damping-off or seedling blight symptoms. Leaf spots appear as light-brown lesions that may contain concentric rings of small, dark pycnidia. Wilting and dark-brown-to-black spots/rot of the root tissue develop upon infection of the storage root. Infected seed crops may develop grayish  lesions or dark streaks on stems that can result in stem breakage; pedicels can also be infected on flower heads.


","Practices that promote vigorous growth of the plant will minimize the disease.

1) Practice 3-year rotations between  crops.

Sword Fern ,(Polystichum munitum)-Die-off,"Unknown. Large areas of uniform patches of sword fern understory have been observed to die-off in the Puget Sound area of Washington including Seward Park in Seattle (in 2013), Kitsap Peninsula (in 2010), and Mercer Island. These circular areas (at least 400 sq ft) have very few surviving ferns and continue to  enlarge each year. Few if any other understory plants occur in  these areas which are left bare with dead fern crowns. The problem is not due to mountain beaver grazing and has not been attributed to suspected soilborne fungi such as Phytophthora or Rhizoctonia.


","Fronds at first wilt, then fall over and die. No fiddle heads are produced in the spring. Entire crowns die including roots. Lesions or active rots are not observed on these tissues. First symptoms may be a decrease in the number of fronds per crown.


","None known or can be suggested until a cause is discovered.

Sycamore ,(Platanus spp.)-Anthracnose,"Apiognomonia veneta (asexual: Discula platani), a fungus that overwinters on infected sycamore twigs and dead leaves. Anthracnose is a common disease of the western sycamore, Platanus racemosa; the American plane tree, P. occidentalis, and the London plane tree, P. acerifolia. On sycamore, the disease is most severe in spring if the average daily temperature at leafing-out and for the next 2 weeks is below 55°F. In spring, fungus in diseased tissue produces spores, which spread by rain or wind to cause new infections. Cultivars and seedlings vary widely in susceptibility. 'Bloodgood', and 'Liberty' are reported to be resistant while  'Columbia' and 'Yarwood' are susceptible in western Oregon.


","Blight is noticeable early in spring as leaves expand. Young leaves turn brown and die as they emerge from buds, or infection may be later as brown blotches or irregular spots on either side of the main leaf vein. Blotches enlarge and coalesce, ultimately covering much of the leaf surface. If the disease is severe, infected leaves fall; in some cases, almost the entire tree is defoliated except for terminal leaves. Newer infections are more rapid in moist weather, so the disease is more severe in wet springs.
If the disease goes back into older twig growth, cankers may form at the twig base; growth originating from that point is girdled and dies. A bushy growth often is in diseased trees due to death of terminal buds and the resultant stimulation of dormant lateral buds, giving the tree a willowy, broom-like appearance.


","

1) Prune out and destroy infected twigs and branches. This  may be difficult if affected twigs and branches are small and numerous and the tree too large for detailed pruning.

2) Rake and destroy fallen leaves and twigs.

Tanoak ,(Notholithocarpus densiflorus)-Armillaria Root Rot,,,,,
Tanoak ,(Notholithocarpus densiflorus)-Sudden Oak Death,"A fungus-like organism, Phytophthora ramorum, killing tanoaks, wild rhododendrons, and evergreen huckleberry in a few isolated spots just north of Brookings, OR, was found during the summer of 2001. There was also incidental leaf infection on salmonberry, cascara, myrtlewood, and poison oak (stem cankers). Federal and international quarantines have been established to prevent the spread of this pathogen in soil and infected plant material. Since the initial discovery, the disease is considered established and Oregon has focused on limiting spread in Curry County through early detection, monitoring, and eradication of symptomatic tanoak trees. Despite these efforts, the quarantine area in Curry County has expanded many times since 2001 from 9 sq. miles to over 500 sq. miles. The rate of disease spread increased most dramatically in 2014 requiring the quarantine area to nearly double in 2015.
Major impacts resulting from the spread of SOD include widespread death of tanoaks, loss of wildlife habitat, and increased soil erosion. Landowners in SOD areas also face increased wildfire risk, hazards from falling stems, and the loss of important landscape and heritage trees. Dying trees have been observed in urban and rural forests and woodlands.
The disease was also discovered in a botanical garden landscape on the north end of Bainbridge Island, WA in 2015. Several plants including were infected with the NA-1 clone including Camellia, Gaultheria, Mahonia, Pieris, Rhododendron, Vaccinium, Viburnum, and Vinca. Although eradication was completed it is suspected that the pathogen will persist and efforts are focused on containment.


","Tanoak (and oak) trees appear to die rapidly, turning from an apparently healthy green to brown within a few weeks. Leaves may at first have a darkened petiole. Dead leaves may remain on trees for up to 1 year after tree death. The disease is characterized by brown or black discolored patches of bark on the lower trunk with an exudation of viscous sap from the bark. Bleeding usually is aboveground within 3 to 15 ft of the soil line. A sunken or flattened area may be observed below the bark. A distinctive dark-reddish canker margin can be seen in the bark and wood. (Many other Phytophthora species can also cause similar cankers on tanoak.) The new growth on young tanoaks may first look wilty or droopy. Bleeding is not always observed on infected tanoaks particularly if their stem diameters are small. Young stump sprouts from infected trees may have necrotic stems and infected leaves.
The typical symptom on myrtle is black leaf tips, usually with a chlorotic halo. An infected madrone will show leaf spots and tip dieback, although these symptoms are not distinctive. Symptoms on manzanita resemble those on madrone. The symptom observed on bigleaf maple is a leaf spot with a diffuse edge. Darkened stem cankers are on evergreen huckleberry. Tissues above the cankers typically die back. In severe cases, the entire aboveground portion of an infected huckleberry plant may be killed.
If you suspect you have seen a P. ramorum-infected plant in Oregon, call the Invasive Species Hotline, 1-800-INVADER (1-800-468-2337).


","Control efforts in Oregon are focused on containing the pathogen where it is found in forests and preventing new infections beyond the current quarantine area. Within the quarantine area, the quarantine requirements vary depending upon your location. For the most current quarantine requirements, please contact the Oregon Department of Agriculture.

1) Do not transport firewood, other susceptible plant material, or soil from diseased areas in California or southwest Oregon.

2) Wash shoes, vehicles, bikes, etc. if you visit infested areas of California or southwest Oregon.

3) Contact the Oregon Department of Agriculture if you see or suspect trees or plants in Oregon with symptoms of this disease.

4) Remove and burn all leaves and branches of dead plants. Do not compost and reuse infected material. Sterilize pruning tools after use with a suitable disinfectant.

5) In Oregon, Notify the ODA's Nursery and Christmas Tree Program Supervisor when importing nursery stock from any out-of-state source.

6) Purchase nursery plants only from nurseries certified as free from  according to federal regulatory standards. A certified nursery will have an official certification shield.

Ternstroemia gymnanthera ,Leaf Spots,"Although this plant is considered relatively disease free, a few fungal leaf spots are reported from Southeastern States. These include Elsinoe leucospila (spot anthracnose), Cercospora sp., and Phyllosticta sp. Most of these are favored by rainy moist weather conditions.


","Cercospora leaf spot-Small brown spots first appear on the mature leaves at the base of the plant in mid- to late winter. Large red to purple blotches often surround the spots on the upper leaf surface. Heavily spotted leaves often turn bright red before they fall to the ground. Leaf spotting starts in the lower limbs and gradually moves upward into the mid-canopy.

2) Remove diseased leaves when observed.

3) Remove and destroy fallen leaves.

Tomato ,(Lycopersicon esculentum)-Anthracnose,"Colletotrichum coccodes, C. dematium, or C. gloeo-sporioides cause anthracnose on tomato. C. coccodes is the most prevalent, but anthracnose is not common in the Pacific Northwest. The fungus overwinters as microsclerotia, often in association with plant debris.
Microsclerotia can survive long periods in soil, producing conidia during moist conditions that also favor infection. Fungi may attack fruit that touch the soil or may be splashed on fruit or foliage. In wet weather, spores produced in spots on fruit are splashed by rain or spread by pickers to infect other fruit. Overhead irrigation favors disease spread. Infection is favored by free moisture and temperatures between 50°F and 86°F.


","Spotting on fruit is the major symptom; however, leaves, stems, or roots also may be infected. Fruit may be infected when green and small but show no evident spotting until ripening. Fruit becomes increasingly susceptible as it approaches maturity. Root infection is primarily in greenhouses and becomes evident as fruit begins to ripen.
At first, infected fruit have small, slightly sunken, circular spots. Spots grow to about 0.5 inch in diameter, darker with concentric rings, and more concave. Centers are usually tan and may have numerous dark specks (microsclerotia). Flesh beneath a lesion can be a lighter color than surrounding tissue. In warm weather, the spot soon penetrates into the fruit, which becomes worthless.
If leaves are infected, small, circular, dark areas of dead tissue, often surrounded by yellow halos, are evident. The oldest leaves are the most commonly infected. Roots may have brown lesions and will contain microsclerotia as they rot. Because of root damage, diseased plants are easily pulled from the soil.


","

1) Rotate at least every other year with a non-solanaceous plant.

2) Irrigate only as needed, never in excess.

3) Use mulches, and stake plants.

4) Remove and destroy infected fruit (prevents buildup of soil population).

5) In greenhouse production use pathogen-free soil, prevent root injury, and avoid closed-recirculation irrigation-fertilization systems.

Tomato ,(Lycopersicon esculentum)-Aster Yellows,"Candidatus (Ca.) Phytoplasma asteris is spread by leafhoppers. The disease is rare on tomato and also occurs on carrot, celery, lettuce, spinach, squash, endive, parsley, onion, and ornamentals. The phytoplasma overwinters on weeds or other crop hosts. The disease follows the leafhopper migration.


","Upper leaflets exhibit a leafroll and yellow-purplish color. Plants are yellow and stunted. As the disease develops, veins become purple.


","Attempts to control aster yellows have only partly succeeded.

1) Control weed hosts.

2) Control leafhopper vectors.

Tomato ,(Lycopersicon esculentum)-Bacterial Canker,"The bacterium, Clavibacter michiganensis subsp. michiganensis, is carried in or on seed and survives in infected tomato debris, weed hosts, volunteer tomatoes, or on contaminated stakes or equipment. Handling seedlings and normal watering may spread the bacterium in seed flats. In the field, handling or pruning plants, using contaminated equipment, cultivation, and rain or irrigation water may spread the bacterium. Plants may be infected at any growth stage.


","Early in the disease, leaflets wilt (petioles remain turgid) and edges curl up or turn brown. Lower leaves turn down. It is common for leaflets on one side to wilt while those on the other side of the midrib appear normal. Later, affected leaves become brown, wither, and die. Open cankers may be evident on petioles and/or midribs. Stems may have longitudinal discolored streaks or cankers. Vascular tissue in the stem and petioles almost always is discolored yellowish to reddish brown. Discoloration is most pronounced at the junction of the stem and petiole. If the stem is broken, often the pith can be pulled out of it as a result of the vascular tissue deterioration. Fruit, when infected, have approximately 0.25-inch spots with raised brown centers and white halos. If plants are from infected seed, the entire plant may wilt and die or fail to set fruit. If transplants are infected at clipping, seedlings may not show symptoms until transplanted to the field.


","

Tomato ,(Lycopersicon esculentum)-Bacterial Spot,"Xanthomonas campestris pv. vesicatoria is a bacterium that overwinters in plant refuse for up to 2 years and can be seedborne. The bacterium infects solanceous weeds such as black nightshade and ground cherry; some strains also infect pepper. Disease may be spread in the field or greenhouse by water (rain, irrigation), insects, equipment, and animals. Temperatures between 75°F and 86°F with a high relative humidity promote disease. Water in the form of dew, rain, or sprinkler irrigation is important for spread.


","Small, semi-circular areas, which have a water-soaked appearance first appear on leaves. Initial leaf spots enlarge, turn dark brown, and are commonly irregular in shape. Small blisters can develop on fruit, and will eventually take on a brown, scabby appearance. Leaf spots can grow together, turning much on the leaf brown. Stems and petioles may exhibit dark streaks. Defoliation, stunting, and reductions in yield result from severe infections.

"
Tomato ,(Lycopersicon esculentum)-Blossom-end Rot,"A localized calcium deficiency due to any soil or growing condition that affects calcium uptake. This physiological problem is common, especially in home gardens. Blossom-end rot often occurs when soil moisture fluctuates. If too little calcium is in the soil or if the soil is high in salts, calcium uptake will be impeded, especially under periods of sudden drought stress. Excessive nitrogen applications, especially in the ammonium form, can increase a plant's demand for calcium. Once calcium is used in the plant, it becomes immobilized and cannot be translocated from older tissues to younger, growing tissues, which need calcium.


","A water-soaked, light tan spot at the blossom end or side of a fruit. The spot enlarges, becoming dark brown or black and leathery. Normally, spots are dry but may become soft if secondary bacteria and fungi invade the fruit. Affected fruit ripen faster than normal.


","

1) Do not plant tomatoes where drainage is poor, surface water accumulates, or soil is droughty.

2) Use a soil test to determine if there is a calcium shortage. If so, add lime, preferably in fall, to adjust soil pH to 6.8 to 7. Mix lime thoroughly in top 8 to 12 inches of soil.

3) Mulch plants with black plastic or loose organic material.

4) Ensure uniform soil moisture. Wet all soil in the root zone at least every 7 to 10 days. About 24 hours after watering, dig a small hole one foot deep to be certain water penetrated that far. Home gardeners should provide even moisture throughout fruiting by controlled watering and mulching.

5) Ensure good air movement by plant spacing and pruning practices. Bu reducing relative humidity, plant transpiration increases, aiding in the uptake of calcium when sufficient amounts are present in soil.

6) Fertilize only moderately to keep plants normally green and vigorous but not luxuriant. Side-dress with nitrogen fertilizer only if required to maintain green color and moderate growth.

7) Foliar applications of calcium nitrate fertilizers or calcium chloride dihydrate (1.5 teaspoons per gal water plus 0.5 teaspoon of a surfactant such as CapSil) on a weekly basis during fruiting can provide necessary calcium when needed. Phytotoxicity may result but making applications in early morning can help avoid spray injury.

",,
Tomato ,(Lycopersicon esculentum)-Catface,"Physiological problem that occurs to somes extent wherever large, fresh-market tomatoes grow. Some cultivars are more likely to show catfacing than others. Growth disturbances during blossoming are thought to be the cause. Prolonged unseasonably cool weather may be involved. Excessive nitrogen fertilizer may aggravate the problem. Catface also may follow exposure to growth-hormone-type herbicides such as 2,4-D. Some fruit of  'Oregon Spring' is affected by catface every year.


","Extreme malformation and scarring at the fruit's blossom end. This may include cavities extending toward the center of the fruit and irregular protuberances. Bands of brown scar tissue usually are between the swellings.


","

1) Use cultivars less likely to have this problem.

2) In greenhouses, avoid low temperatures.

",,
Tomato ,(Lycopersicon esculentum)-Common Mosaic of Tomato (Internal Browning of Fruit),"Tomato mosaic virus (most commonly) or Tobacco mosaic virus, which also affects pepper, eggplant, petunia, and many other solanaceous plants. The virus spreads readily by workers' hands, equipment, and clothing. It persists in infected plant residue and may be on seed.


","Symptoms depend on the virus strain. Often, foliage mottles with alternating light and dark green areas. New leaflets curl and are slightly malformed. More severely affected leaves are badly distorted and rather fern-like. Plants usually are somewhat stunted and bear few fruit if infected when young. Plants and fruit are not much smaller if plants are infected after they reach fruiting stage. Occasionally necrotic spots or streaks develop on stems and leaves. Sometimes fruit ripens unevenly, or the fruit wall turns brown internally.


","

1) Use resistant cultivars.

2) Use healthy transplants and pathogen-free seed.

3) Wash hands with soap and water before handling plants.

4) Disinfect equipment.

5) Use clean soil each year in seedbeds, or sterilize old soil.

6) Do not plant in a field with infected debris.

7) Do not smoke while handling tomato plants.

",,
Tomato ,(Lycopersicon esculentum)-Curly Top,"The Beet curly top virus, which also infects a wide range of crops such as bean, beet, cucurbits, spinach, squash, and pepper. The virus is disseminated by the beet leafhopper, Circulifer tenellus. There are no reports of seed transmission. The disease may be severe in central and eastern Oregon and Washington. It occurs in the Willamette Valley of Oregon, especially the northern valley when winds blowing through the Columbia Gorge transport the beet leafhopper from eastern Oregon.
The leafhopper takes up the virus when feeding and keeps it in its body the rest of its life. Normally, the virus must incubate 21 to 24 hours or longer in the insect's body before it can be transmitted to another plant, but if the temperature is very high incubation may be reduced to 4 to 6 hours. Leafhopper eggs never carry the virus.
Temperature affects the interval between the insect's feeding and the appearance of curly top symptoms. If it is very hot, symptoms may show in 24 hours; with normal temperatures, in 7 to 14 days; in cool weather, up to 30 days. The disease is in areas where light is intense, summer heat is prolonged, relative humidity is low, and evaporation is rapid. In years when average relative humidity is 35%, the disease is very severe; when it is over 50%, there is almost no curly top. Shading, which lowers light intensity and retards evaporation, probably delays leafhopper visits, decreases the infection rate, and reduces symptom expression.


","Leaflets roll up and twist sharply, exposing their undersurfaces. Foliage is stiff and leathery, and the entire plant is a peculiar dull yellow. Leaflet veins purple, and the plant often is stunted. Many roots and rootlets die, as do severely affected plants. Can be confused with aster yellows.


","Many controls, including trying to control the leafhopper vector, have not produced satisfactory results.

1) These cultivars are resistant to curly top (those marked VF also are resistant to Verticillium and Fusarium wilt): Payette, Owyhee, Super Star VF, Red Lode VF, Ida-Red VF, Parma VF, Bicentennial VF, Rowpac VF, Columbia VF, Roza VF, and Salad Master VF.

2) Shading plants helps avoid leafhopper attack in home gardens.

Tomato ,(Lycopersicon esculentum)-Damping-off (Seed and Seedling Rot),"The following fungi or fungus-like microorganisms, Pythium spp., Phytophthora spp., and Rhizoctonia solani, attack young seedlings of many vegetables including tomato. Seedlings are susceptible to infection before or after emerging from soil. If seedlings are affected before emerging, it appears as poor germination. If the decay is after emergence, seedlings that fall over or die are said to ""damp-off."" The disease's destructiveness depends on environmental conditions and the amount of fungus in the soil. Cool, cloudy weather, wet soil, compacted soil, high humidity, and overcrowding are especially favorable to damping-off. Poor ventilation in greenhouses and contaminated soil or equipment also favors damping-off.


","Young seedlings develop a sunken, necrotic lesion near the soil line. If the lesion girdles the stem, the seedling collapses and soon dies. Also, seeds simply may not emerge.


","

1) In the greenhouse or seedbed, pasteurize the soil with heat. For example, most pathogens die if soil is heated to 158°F (70°C) for 30 min. with aerated steam.

2) Use raised beds to improve soil drainage, and avoid excessive irrigation.

3) If damping-off occurs, stop watering for a while. Allow soil to dry somewhat around the plants. If the seedlings are in flats or in cold frames, give them as much air and light as possible.

4) Use good sanitation in greenhouses.

Tomato ,(Lycopersicon esculentum)-Early Blight,"Alternaria tomatophilai (formerly A. solani), a fungus that may also attack horsenettle, nightshade, and other wild plants related to tomato. The fungus may be on or in seed, but internal infection is rare in seed produced commercially. The fungus can survive on infected plant refuse in soil or overwinter on solanaceous plants. Infection is favored by temperatures of 75°F to 84°F, high moisture, and low soil fertility. The disease is not common in Oregon, particularly west of the Cascade Range.


","Small, irregular, blackish brown spots usually first appear on older leaves. Spots enlarge to 0.25 to 0.5 inch in diameter, and they commonly show ridged concentric rings in a target pattern. Leaf tissue around the spots turns yellow. If spots are numerous, the entire leaf will be yellowed. Some spotting may be on older leaves early in the season, but the greatest injury usually is as fruit begins to mature. Defoliation may be severe if environmental conditions are favorable, exposing the fruit to sun scald.
Older fruit develop dark, leathery, sunken spots that may be quite large with concentric markings similar to those on diseased leaves. The dark, dry decay may extend some depth into the fruit. Infected mature or immature fruit frequently fall from the plant.
Seedlings may have circular or elongated lesions with concentric markings on the stem, which will girdle the plant. This symptom is known as collar rot.

Tomato ,(Lycopersicon esculentum)-Late Blight,"Phytophthora infestans, a fungus-like microorganism that also attacks potato (Irish, not sweet). It usually does not survive in soil or dead plant debris. For an epidemic to begin in any one area, the microorganism must overwinter in potato tubers (culls, volunteers) or be reintroduced on seed potatoes or tomato transplants, or live spores must blow in with rain. Besides potato and tomato, P. infestans can infect only a few other, closely related plants. Occasionally peppers and eggplants are mildly infected, as are a few related weeds such as hairy nightshade (Solanum sarrachoides) and bittersweet nightshade (Solanum ducamara). It is a common problem west of the Cascade Range. Since 1990, there have been severe outbreaks of late blight in commercial and home garden plantings of potato and tomato in both the United States and Canada. Many have been associated with new strains of the late-blight microbe. Late blight of tomato is a disease that progresses very rapidly. Cool, wet weather favors disease development; hot, dry weather checks it. Infected stems can harbor the pathogen in dry weather, enabling sporulation and late-blight spread when wetter conditions return. Rainy weather, fog, and dew are favorable for late blight.
No commercial cultivars have sufficient resistance to P. infestans to slow disease development, and once disease begins, cultural controls may fail to slow its development. Chemical control, initiated before disease begins, is the only method that can prevent complete crop destruction.


","Lesions start as irregular, greenish, water-soaked spots on leaves, petioles, and/or stems. Under cool, moist conditions, spots rapidly enlarge to form purplish black lesions. Lesions can girdle affected stems, killing foliage farther out. During periods of high humidity and leaf wetness, a cottony white mold usually is visible on lower leaf surfaces at the edges of lesions. In dry weather, infected leaf tissues quickly dry up, and the white mold disappears. On green fruit, gray-green water-soaked spots form, enlarge, coalesce, and darken, resulting in large, firm, brown, leathery-appearing lesions. If conditions remain moist, abundant white mold will develop on the lesions, and secondary soft-rot bacteria may follow, resulting in a slimy wet rot of the entire fruit. On ripe fruit, lesions have cream-colored concentric zones, which eventually coalesce and affect the entire fruit.


","Cultural controls alone won't prevent disease during seasons with wet, cool weather. However, the following measures will improve your chances of raising a successful crop.

1) Plant only healthy-appearing tomato transplants. Check to make sure plants are free of dark lesions on leaves or stems. If starting transplants from seed, air-dry freshly harvested seed at least 3 days.

2) Destroy volunteer tomatoes and potatoes routinely by cultivation or herbicides. Do not let volunteers grow, even on compost piles. Infected tomato refuse should be buried or bagged and put in the trash.

3) Avoid wetting foliage when irrigating, especially in late afternoon and evening.

4) Space, stake, and prune tomato plants to provide good air circulation.

5) Tomato cultivars Mountain Magic, Wapsipinicon Peach, Matt's Wild Cherry, and Pruden's Purple had high levels of resistance to multiple races of the late blight pathogen in trials conducted by University of Wisconsin-Madison while the cultivar Legend, developed by OSU, was resistant to one race of the three pathogen races tested. 'Plum Regal', 'Defiant', and 'Iron Lady' also appear to have resistance to late blight. Some cherry tomato cultivars (Red Cherry and Sweetie) were more tolerant to late blight in WSU trials.

","Spray at regular intervals. Begin chemical control programs before symptoms appear.

Tomato ,(Lycopersicon esculentum)-Phoma Rot,"The fungus, Phoma destructive,  can infect tomato and peppers and survives in soil or infected plant debris. This fungus can be seedborne in paprika and perhaps other crops in the family Solanaceae. Plant injury, including by insects, enhances infection. Moderate temperature (68°F) and high humidity promote the release of water-splashed conidia from pycnidia that lead to disease build-up, including in storage if fruit are wet when harvested.


","Leaf spots start as dark brown to black areas that are slightly sunken and irregular in shape that develop concentric rings over time and small, black pycnidia. Stems can develop dark-brown lesions with concentric rings.  Both green and ripe fruit can develop sunken, black, leathery lesions with numerous black pycnidia in the center.

Tomato ,(Lycopersicon esculentum)-Powdery Mildew,"The fungi, Leveillula taurica (syn. = Oidiopsis taurica, Erysiphe taurica) and Oidium neolycopersici (syn. = Pseudoidium neolycopersici), are both occurring on tomato in western Oregon. Oidium lycopersici has been reported on tomato in California. Powdery mildew can be more severe under warm, semiarid conditions, and severe disease outbreaks can develop in plastic tunnels or greenhouses. Leveillula taurica has a wide crop and weed host range on which it can overwinter. Oidium neolycopersici is primarily a problem on tomato but can infect a few taxa of the Solanaceae family.
Temperatures below 86°F favor infection; higher temperatures accelerate symptoms once infection is established. Cool nights permit infection in areas with high daytime temperatures.


","Light green to bright yellow, irregularly-shaped blotches develop on upper leaf surfaces and may or may not be accompanied by a profuse whitish sporulation on the upper and/or lower leaf surface; the lesion centers later turn necrotic. Individual leaves die but can stay on the plant. Severe infections can result in leaf deformities. Leveillula taurica usually is seen as a whitish powdery growth on the leaf's lower side, but it sporulates only sparsely. Oidium neolycopersici can produce a profuse white powdery growth on the upper leaf surface, and if humidity is high, sporulation can occur on the underside of leaves; the whitish sporulation can also occur on stems and petioles.

Tomato ,(Lycopersicon esculentum)-Tomato Spotted Wilt,"The Tomato spotted wilt virus (formerly TSWV, L strain), which is transmitted from plant to plant by thrips (an insect). This and the closely related Impatiens necrotic spot virus can infect hundreds of weed, ornamental, and vegetable species, which then can harbor the virus. In Oregon, the problem is primarily in greenhouse tomatoes but has been found also in home gardens. Seed transmission has been reported in tomato.


","Symptom severity depends on when plants are infected. Plants infected young may be severely stunted with irregular leaf shapes, necrotic young leaves, and an unthrifty appearance. Plants infected when older may show stunting but will have leaves that develop bronze or purplish irregular markings on the leaflets' upper sides.
Markings may include flecking or ringspots. Leaf distortion, leaf yellowing, dark purple stem streaks, tip dieback, or wilt also may occur. Pale green or white fruit blotches or spots develop on green fruit. Maturing fruit has yellow, orange, or green spots, blotches, or concentric lines. Ring spots or black spots also may be present. Severely affected plants may form no fruit at all, or fruit may be small and unmarketable. Diseased plants do not yield well.


","

1) Greenhouse production.

1.1) Do not grow vegetable transplants in greenhouses that contain or recently contained ornamentals, especially if they were infected with TSWV.
1.2) Prevent thrips from entering and monitor for them.
1.3) Destroy infected plants. Do not leave cull piles.
1.4) Keep the greenhouse free of weeds, which may be virus reservoirs.
2) Commercial field production.

2.1) Do not accept or plant transplants that have ring spots or bronze to purple flecks on leaves.
2.2) Do not plant next to greenhouses in which herbaceous ornamentals are grown.
2.3) Plant on UV-reflective mulch.
3) Home gardens.

3.1) Inspect plants for disease symptoms. Plant only pathogen-free transplants.
3.2) Destroy any infected plants that appear in the garden.
3.3) Plant on UV-reflective mulch.
","None, once plants are infected. However, greenhouse operations should control the thrips vector to prevent disease spread. Thrips control is more difficult in field situations.

Tomato ,(Lycopersicon esculentum)-Tomato Yellow Leaf Curl,"The Tomato yellow leaf curl virus has been found in California during 2007 and is transmitted by adult silverleaf whiteflies, but not by seed. This has not been reported in the Pacific Northwest.


","The margins of tomato leaves turn yellow and a yellow mottling of the leaf area. Leaves cup upwards, may be reduced in size, and flowers may drop.


",,,
Tomato ,(Lycopersicon esculentum)-White Mold,"A fungus, Sclerotinia sclerotiorum, that attacks numerous other hosts and overwinters as hard, black sclerotia in soil and plant debris. The fungus colonizes any organic debris such as old leaves, stems or blossoms. Usually it grows from these materials into the healthy parts of the tomato. High humidity and free moisture favor infection.


","First, a rapidly expanding soft rot centers on a piece of organic material such as decaying leaves and flower petals. Stems may be girdled, killing the plant portions above the lesion. Affected stems turn light tan to a straw color and, under moist conditions, are covered with white cottony mycelium. Hard, black, irregularly shaped sclerotia less than 0.25 inch to almost 1 inch long develop in the mycelium and within the tomato's stem tissue. Fruit may be infected; if so, it looks gray and develops a watery rot.


","

1) Space plants so the lower canopy dries out between irrigations.

2) Limit overhead irrigation to only that necessary for crop production. A few deep irrigations are better than frequent shallow ones.

3) In smaller plantings, remove infected material to reduce the sclerotia population in the soil.

4) Use long rotations (3 to 4 years) with cereal crops.

Tomato ,"(Lycopersicon esculentum)-Wilts (Fusarium Wilt, Verticillium Wilt)","Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici or Verticillium dahliae, fungi that live in soil and cause wilt symptoms. Verticillium survives in infected debris up to 8 years and are favored by cool weather (68°F to 75°F). F. oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici is favored by warmer weather (84°F) and can survive several years in soil. Fusarium wilt is favored by high phosphorus, ammonium nitrogen, or micronutrient levels. Verticillium dahliae infects a wide range of weed and crop plants. These wilt fungi can be spread by infested equipment, transplants, and windborne or waterborne infested soil.


","Symptoms are similar for both fungi, so the diseases cannot be distinguished based on symptoms alone. Lower leaves yellow, mostly on one side. Plants wilt during the hot part of the day but recover in the evening. Eventually the leaves remain wilted, shrivel, turn brown, and die. The vascular system discolors. Growth is retarded, and yields are low.


","

1) Use resistant cultivars. They are marked with a  (for resistance) and/or F (for  resistance). Several VF lines are available from seed companies.

2) Home gardeners should remove and destroy all affected plant tissue, including roots.

3) Rotating out of tomatoes 4 to 6 years may reduce losses from either disease, but success is not assured because the host range is so wide.

Tulip Tree ,(Liriodendron tulipifera)-Verticillium Wilt,,,,,
Tulip,Break,"Break is a disease name for any of several viruses including Tulip breaking virus, Tulip band-breaking virus, Tulip top-breaking virus, Rembrandt tulip-breaking virus and Lily mottle virus. Each is in the potyvirus group and is long flexuous rods. These viruses are spread by several species of aphids in a nonpersistent manner. They can also be mechanically transmitted in plant sap. Viruses survive in infected bulbs. White and yellow tulip cultivars generally do not show symptoms and thus may increase the risk that this disease will spread to other plants. Several other viruses have been reported to cause minor flower-breaking symptoms but flower and leaf symptoms are distinctly different.
The tulip clutivars Apeldoorn, Kees Nelis, and Lustige Witwe are susceptible, while clutivars Cantata, Juan, Madame Lefeber, and Priceps are resistant.
The symptoms were first described in tulips by Carolus Clusius in 1576. Bulbs producing variegated flowers were very desired and often sold for high prices, especially during the early seventeenth century. Tulips with variegated flowers were so rare and in such high demand that they created a wild speculation craze (tulipomania) which almost caused the collapse of the Dutch economy.


","Flower petals have stripes, streaks, feathering or flames of different colors. Symptoms vary with the flower cultivar, and age at time of infection. The color variation is related to the local accumulation of pigments in the upper epidermal layer. The lighter colors appear as irregular streaks or fine feathering. Dark breaking occurs when the color in the epidermal cells intensifies in small dark streaks or elongated flecks. The flame pattern appears as narrow or broad streaks of color in the center portion of the petal. Flames may also occur near petal edges. Flower size, pollen production and seed set are reduced. Over time vigor and flower quality of infected plants decline and bulbs gradually degenerate.
Easily confused with genetic variegation, which is readily available in commercial plants.


","Management is based on the prevention of infection by integrating many tactics.

1) Routinely scout, remove, and destroy infected plants including  volunteer plants from previous bulb crops.

2) Purchase and plant virus-tested (and found to be free of known viruses) material.

3) Exclude aphids with fine mesh screening.

4) Harvest early to reduce expsure to increasing aphid populations.

5) Disinfect cutting knives, containers, and equipment.

","Aphid control using insecticides has not prevented spread. Weekly applications of minerial oil have shown some efficacy. See the PNW Insect Management Handbook for details.

Tulip,Crown Rot,"Sclerotium delphinii, a fungus that can survive many years in soil as sclerotia. Infection usually occurs on the stems near the soil surface. A low percentage of sclerotia survived after only a month in the soil when dried first. The disease is widespread but not as common or severe as Fire (Botrytis blight), yet it can cause serious damage, especially in moist, warm soils. In the Pacific Northwest, crown rot is more common on bulbous iris, tulips and lilies than daffodils.


","Leaves turn red, and plants wilt and die. The lower stem and the bulb rot and generally are covered with the white thread-like fungal mycelium. Round, reddish brown sclerotia (fungal resting bodies) about 0.0625 to 0.25 inch in diameter often form on the lower stem and bulb.


","

1) Remove and destroy infected plants and adjacent soil containing the fungal mycelium and sclerotia.

2) Sort and clean bulbs carefully, destroying all infected bulbs, soil, and debris.

3) Dig infected plants early if soil is warm and moist. Dry bulbs quickly and store in layers under dry conditions with good air circulation.

4) Plant pathogen-free bulbs in uninfested soil.

5) Wash equipment and machinery between fields.

Tulip,Fire,"Botrytis tulipae, a fungus that overwinters as sclerotia in soil, affected bulbs, and diseased plant residue. Germination of sclerotia and infection of emerging shoots is greatest when soil is 41°F. Flowers are very susceptible to this fungus. Flower petals that drop onto leaves can promote further development on the leaves, especially in the leaf axils and on stems. High humidity, rainfall, and moderate temperatures favor the blight phase of this disease. Sclerotia can develop at the base of stems and on the outer scales of the developing daughter bulbs. Loss of leaves results in a severe reduction in bulb yields. Host range is limited to tulip.


","Emerging shoots that become infected prior to emergence are called ""fireheads"". Spores produced on fireheads or sclerotia near the surface of the soil can spread to nearby foliage which develop small, somewhat elongated spots that often look yellow and water soaked. As spots enlarge, leaves may distort and partially rot, particularly at the base. As the disease advances, infected areas turn whitish gray. Numerous leaves are distorted or partially collapsed. The fungus attacks flowers and flower stems the same way. The whitish gray, powdery spore coating on the flowers is very noticeable. At the stem's base and on the bulb's outer scales may be many blackish or dark brown sclerotia, which carry the fungus from one growing season to the next or other unfavorable conditions.


","Focus on integrating several cultural tactics.

1) At fall planting time, examine all bulbs; discard diseased ones.

2) Rotate tulips to new location each year to prevent fungal scerotia buildup in soil.

3) Plant using healthy stock.

4) Space plants for good air circulation.

5) Avoid high rates of nitrogen.

6) Remove diseased fireheads as they emerge from the soil. Continue to remove diseased plants and adjacent soil as soon as you notice the disease. Also, remove flowers before petal fall.

7) Annual digging during dry weather.

Tulip,Fusarium Basal Rot,"Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. tulipae, a fungus that lives in soil and on plant debris. The disease became a problem with shorter rotations that favored build up of inoculum. The disease is widespread but not as common or severe as Fire (Botrytis blight); it is worse on some tulip cultivars and occurs primarily in storage. Symptoms may be more severe at higher (61°F) than lower (54°F) temperatures. These fungi penetrate through the roots into the tissue of the planted bulbs and colonize the basal plate of the young bulb in the field. Infection more frequently occurs on the fleshy outer scale of the new bulb.


","Leaves turn red, and plants wilt and often die. The bulb base and roots rot. Spots may also develop on the top or sides of the bulb. When diseased bulbs go into storage they become dull white with firm shrunken bases that usually are covered with whitish or pinkish fungal growth. If other organisms enter the decayed area, it may become soft and develop a rank smell. Symptoms usually are most evident in storage rather than in the field. When diseased bulbs are forced in the greenhouse for flowering, stunted growth and leaf yellowing occurs within a few weeks. Plants generally die before flowering. The basal plate and roots decay and become a dull gray. The decay spreads to the bulb scales and lower stem. Fine dark streaks may be seen in the stem.

Tulip,Gray Bulb Rot,"Rhizoctonia tuliparum, a fungus that survives in the soil for at least 3 to 5 years as sclerotia. After 10 years there may still be 10% viable sclerotia. Sclerotia germinate and infect bulbs after planting or in the very early spring. Can be transported on diseased bulbs. Volunteer plants from previous bulb crops may help fungus survive from year to year. Primarily a problem on tulip and iris but daffodil, crocus, gladiolus, and  lily are also possible hosts.


","Bulbs rot from the top down. The fungus forms felty masses between the scales. Bulbs and roots turn grayish in color and progressively dry and shrivel at the site of infection. Brown to black, flattened scerotia (1 to 10 mm in diameter) can be found on bulbs and in the surrounding soil. Infected bulbs may not show any growth in the spring.

Turnip and Rutabaga ,(Brassica sp.)-Black Leg (Phoma Dry Rot),"Leptosphaeria maculans (syn. Plenodomus lingam, anamorph: Phoma lingam) is a fungus that can infect a range of cruciferous crops. Host plants include Brassica crops (broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cabbage, collards, canola, kale, mizuna, mustard greens, etc.), Sinapis (white and yellow mustard), and Raphanus (daikon and radish). Cruciferous weeds common in the Pacific Northwest can be host to black leg, including: birdsrape mustard (Brassica rapa), black mustard (B. nigra), western yellow cress or curvepod yellowcress (Rorippa curvisiliqua), tansymustard (Descurainia pinnata), hedge mustard (Sisymbrium officinale), tumble mustard (S. altissimum), small tumbleweed mustard (S. loeselii), pennycress (Thlaspi arvense), mouseear cress (Arabidopsis thaliana), annual wallrocket (Diplotaxis muralis), perennial wallrocket (D. tenuifolia), and wild radish (Raphanus raphanistrum). The fungus survives on living plants as pycnidia, which produce water-splashed pycnidiospores, or survives with plant debris as pycnidia and/or pseudothecia. Pseudothecia, sexual reproductive structures, release ascospores that may be windborne long distances, at least several miles and perhaps further with storm fronts. The fungus survives in association with infected plant residues until the plant debris decomposes (1 to 4 years). In fall-sown crops or winter weeds, new pseudothecia can form on dead portions of infected plants prior to harvest or plant death, and pseudothecia can continue forming in the plant residues remaining on the soil surface after harvest. In spring-sown crops, pseudothecia do not form on dead parts of infected plants until after harvest. Timing of ascospore release is dependent on temperature and rainfall. When infected plant residues are on the soil surface, ascospores release from pseudothecia following wet or humid conditions and when mean temperatures are between 46°F and 59°F.  Conditions conducive for ascospore production and release commonly occur during the fall, winter, and spring-times throughout portions of the Pacific Northwest. Trap plants deployed weekly by OSU at multiple sites around the Willamette Valley in western Oregon, beginning in October 2014 and 2015, showed that ascospore infections begin around mid-October. During 2015-2016, ascospore infections of trap plants occurred from mid-October all the way into May, with severe disease pressure during February and March. Two types of pycnidia (which produce asexual spores known as pycnidiospores) can be found; one on infected, live plants (thinner-walled pycnidium with a neck) and the other on crop residues (thicker-walled pycnidium with a narrow ostiole). Pycnidiospores are dispersed by splashing rain or irrigation water, so pycnidiospore movement is limited to relatively short distances, but pycnidiospores can add to the overall incidence and severity of disease within a field. Workers or equipment moving through infected plantings during wet conditions when pycnidia are present can spread black leg. Wounding, insect, or herbicide injury can result in greater disease severity.
Black leg can also move with infected seed, Leptosphaeria can survive for years in association with seed. Leaf spots on cotyledons or first true leaves can be a result of infested seed, but regional epidemics are thought to arise from infected plant debris if seed lots used for planting are Leptosphaeria-free. The Oregon Department of Agriculture now requires that all crucifer seed, even half ounce or smaller packets, that is to be planted in Oregon must be accompanied by an official test showing that the untreated seed is free from black leg (Leptosphaeria species). Black leg can reduce vegetable and seed crop yields, and low levels of seed infection coupled with weather favorable for disease spread can lead to stand die-out in a field. After a disease outbreak in a larger geographic area, the threat to seed yield or storage root harvests in fall-sown crops is much greater due to the abundance of affected crop residues on the soil surface, especially if field-wide epidemics occurred in no-till production. Widespread leaf spot and subsequent black leg stem cankers can result from unprotected plants being exposed to ascospores released from infected crop residues. Replanting or allowing volunteers to grow in a field after a black leg outbreak can result in high numbers of infected seedlings by fall in western Oregon or Washington Brassica seed fields, perpetuating disease. Planting adjacent to a previously-infected field in Oregon can also result in a high disease incidence (40 to 60%) within a new planting by December, while planting within a few miles of an infected residue site can result in generalized infections across new fields (1 to 5%) by December. Researchers at OSU have observed in fall-planted seed fields in western Oregon that uncontrolled black leg infections can increase from 1 to 5% disease incidence up to 40 to 90% of the plants in a stand being infected within a 6-week period. Infections of fall-planted vegetable or seed fields can lead to stand losses through winter and into the spring. Secondary diseases are common on plants with black leg; Sclerotinia, Botrytis, and soft rot bacteria are especially common on black leg-infected plants in western Oregon during rainy weather and may mask black leg infections by six weeks later.


","Damping-off typically occurs if infected seed is planted. In many crucifer types, a black streak inside the lower stem can be seen early when seed was infected and leads to decay of the lower stem. Sometimes small, brown flecks develop on cotyledons. Affected plants that survive infection at the seedling stage from seedborne inoculum will be stunted and often develop a rot of the stem at or just below the soil line which moves upwards, and causes plants to die. Generalized leaf spot have been observed across fall-planted seed fields in western Oregon after initial infections due to windblown spore (ascospore). Spots first appear as pale, irregular spots on cotyledons, leaves, stems, or petioles; leaf spots later become somewhat circular to oval in shape with ashy-gray colored centers containing scattered tiny, black pycnidia. Sometimes the center of leaf spots will fall out, especially after heavy rainfall, but a narrow, ashy-gray band usually remains where pycnidia can be seen. The fungus grows systemically down the plant from leaf spots, and later can erupt on the stem as a canker. Stem cankers are elongated, with purple-black borders, and may girdle the stem as well as decay pith tissues. Vascular tissues may turn black in color in infected areas of the plant. Stem cankers or stem lesions, can extend further down the plant, resulting in a grayish-black rot of storage roots. Infections may be apparent on the outer portion of storage roots, and usually include areas with an ashy-gray appearance where tiny, black pycnidia can be found.
In fall-planted turnip crops, leaf spots may appear on leaves at initially low levels but increase as pycnidiospores spread the leaf spot. Symptoms on seed pods are rare and inconspicuous. Typically, affected seed plants are weaker, especially if infected during the previous fall, and lodge readily after flowering. If stand die-out has occurred due to severe disease, widespread lodging may be observed in seed fields.


","

1) Plant only seed certified by official testing to be free of .

2) Avoid planting in or adjacent to a site where disease has occurred within the last 3 to 4 years; plantings within a quarter of a mile of a field containing black leg-infected crucifer residues are at high risk for developing black leg.

3) Avoid working in infected fields when leaves are wet as disease can be readily spread.

4) Delay spring plantings until the weather is drier to avoid periods of ascospore release.

5) Bury residues as soon as possible after harvest by deep plowing, or remove plant debris. Flailing followed by a shallow incorporation may be sufficient depending on amount and size of plant debris as well as environmental conditions.

6) Control susceptible weeds and control volunteer crucifers.

7) Hot water seed treatment for 20 min. in water at 122°F (50°C).

8) For organic production, removal of affected leaves shortly after leaf spots develop can reduce secondary spread within a planting as well as the incidence of stem cankers.

","Seed treatment and a foliar fungicide program will be essential if growing seed fields in any region where black leg epidemics have occurred across a larger geographic area. Infected seed can occur in seed lots, certified to be free of black leg, at levels below the detection threshold by seed testing, and chemical or hot water seed treatments will aid in controlling disease introduction by infected seed.

","The fine rootlets turn black and collapse. On the main taproot, dark surface lesions develop. With age, these enlarge into grayish black discolored areas of irregular size and shape just beneath the root surface. The main root may be girdled and plant growth interrupted until new roots form above the girdle. This is the most common symptom on rutabaga. Rutabagas in the six- to seven-leaf stage frequently wilt in the warm part of the day. Systemic infection occurs occasionally, resulting in darkened vascular tissue within a normal-looking root. Rhizoctonia solani may cause similar symptoms on turnip and rutabaga roots (wirestem and crater rot).


","

1) If possible, do not plant any crucifer in infested fields for at least 3 years, and prevent cruciferous weeds during that time.

2) The rutabaga 'American Purple Top' has good tolerance.

Turnip and Rutabaga ,(Brassica sp.)-Boron Deficiency,"Deficiency or unavailability of boron in the soil and subsequent deficiency in the plant. All vegetables require boron for growth, but the amount required varies considerably. Turnip, rutabaga, and cauliflower are sensitive to boron deficiency, which is common in soil that is alkaline or sandy and subject to excessive leaching. In any soil, boron also may become less available during long droughts.


","Leaves may or may not show abnormalities. They may turn reddish and stunted if deficiency is severe. Leaves may be twisted and curled and finally die. Roots develop a glassiness or water core of the root flesh followed by internal gray, punky flecks or spots that later change to brown or black areas.


","

1) Use a fertilizer with an appropriate level of boron based on a soil test. The specific amount needed to avoid boron deficiency varies widely by area.

2) If boron deficiency has been a problem, particularly in alkaline soils, apply soluble boron at 1 lb/100 gal water once or twice to foliage before deficiency symptoms appear.

3) Maintain uniform soil moisture through irrigation.

Turnip and Rutabaga ,(Brassica sp.)-Clubroot,"The disease is caused by Plasmodiophora brassicae, a fungus that can survive in soil 18 or more years after an infected crop. It can spread by any means that moves soil: wind and water, footwear and equipment, and in infected transplants. Soils that are cool, wet (70% to 80% water-holding capacity) and acidic favor the pathogen.
Clubroot probably affects all species of the cruciferous group including wild mustard. There are races within the clubroot pathogen population; certain strains of clubroot vary in the range of cruciferous species affected. The fungus that causes clubroot occurs worldwide and possibly also infects plants in the rose, poppy, and grass families. However, these plants rarely show typical symptoms of the disease. Viable spores of Plasmodiophora brassicae were detected on canola, pea and wheat seeds as well as on potato tubers harvested from clubroot-infested fields in Alberta, Canada.


","Diseased plants are chlorotic, later turning yellowish, and are slow to grow and develop. They often partially wilt during warm days. Beneath the fleshy root, enlarged club-like growths develop. These ultimately become infected with secondary bacteria, rot, and break down.


","

1) Early infection of seedlings can result in severe symptoms, so it is important to use only uninfected seedbeds and clean transplant media, trays, and equipment.

2) Do not heavily lime seedbeds or transplant growing media. That may mask the disease, which could flare up once seedlings are transplanted to a soil of lower pH.

3) Never allow drainage water or soil from an infested field to enter an irrigation source. Spores move easily in irrigation water.

4) Work in pathogen-free fields before moving people and machinery into infested fields. Thoroughly clean soil off machinery and equipment before moving from an infested field to a clean field.

5) If it is necessary to grow susceptible crops in suspect or infested fields, incorporate enough finely ground limestone the year before planting to raise soil pH above 7. Use lime applications that increase soil pH as well as the level of soil calcium. Thoroughly mix lime into soil to maximize potential disease control. Lime inhibits disease development but will not prevent a disease outbreak if the soil's spore load is sufficiently high. Soil types vary considerably in their response to efforts to alter the pH with lime applications. Therefore, measure the initial soil pH, follow Soil Moisture Potential (SMP) test recommendations, and monitor the changes after application. Periodically monitor pH in subsequent years to determine the stability of the change.

6) If planting in a suspect or infected field, incorporate hydrated lime at 1,500 lb/A at least 6 weeks before planting, whether pH is neutral or alkaline, to give additional disease control.

7) Long rotations (6 years or longer) help prevent a pathogen buildup or reduce disease.

8) Control wild mustards if they are a weed problem.

9) The form of nitrogen fertilizer can also influence disease. The use of calcium nitrate may result in less disease compared to ammonium sulfate or urea.

10) The cultivars Kingston, Laurentian, Marian, and York are resistant to some races and may be useful depending on which races are in the area.

Turnip and Rutabaga ,(Brassica sp.)-Downy Mildew,,,,,
Turnip and Rutabaga ,(Brassica sp.)-Light Leaf Spot,"The fungus, Cylindrosporium concentricum (sexual stage: Pyrenopeziza brassicae) has been found in Oregon on canola, turnip, volunteer or wild radish, wild mustard, volunteer black mustard, vegetable Brassica seed fields, and Brassica species used as cover crops during 2014; all brassicas crops grown in the Pacific Northwest are probably susceptible but the specific host range within Brassicaceae is unknown at this time. Oilseed rape and cauliflower are reported to be more susceptible than Brussels sprouts or kale, but there is a range of susceptibility within each crop species. Observations in western Oregon indicate that fall-planted turnip seed fields can be severely infected with light leaf spot, leading to plant die-out and severe stunting by the following spring. The pathogen has been a problem on oilseed rape in various parts of the world with seed losses estimated at 22% when outbreaks have occurred in the United Kingdom. This disease hasn't been previously reported in North America though an infected mustard field was found in western Oregon during 1998. Oilseed rape is very susceptible and losses results from stand die-out, reduced pod numbers, premature pod ripening, or an overall growth reduction with less severe infections. Brassicas grown as vegetables in other areas of the globe, where this disease has been reported, suffer blemish defects by relatively mild infections, causing a decrease in quality but not of yield quantity. Trichloroacetic acid-based herbicides may increase plant susceptibility by affecting the waxy layer of leaves.
Ascospores develop from apothecia on infected plant residues and can be wind-dispersed relatively long distances after a wetting period, infecting susceptible plants. Asexual spores (conidia) develop but spread relatively short distances by rain or splashing water, potentially causing pod infections during the following spring. Seed can be infected or casually infested with the asexual stage yet seed transmission occurs at very low rates due to rapid die-out of the pathogen on seed. Still, epidemics can be initiated by seedborne inoculum or from neighboring fields of infected plants or residues, or from infected volunteers. Wet conditions and cool temperatures (around 60°F is optimum) promote disease development. Fall-infected plants may remain symptomless through the winter season till the following spring. Light leaf spot reappeared during late February in western Oregon, but ascospores probably began infecting during the previous October and November, possibly throughout the winter.


","This fungus can attack leaves, stems and pods. Flecking may be observed on cotyledons while leaf infections start as discolored patches that develop into irregular brown lesions with cracked centers, sometimes turning black. Veins surrounding young lesions often take on an olive-brown hue and may exhibit deformities. Leaf lesions can coalesce, causing death of leaves. When leaves are infected young, distortion can develop. Stem lesions are superficial, elongated brownish streaks with grayish-black margins and can be mistaken for black leg, except decay does not affect the stem pith. Flower infections may cause abortion. Pods infected early appear distorted while pods infected later result in relatively healthy looking pods but will have white spore masses. Seedlings can be killed or plants may be stunted.


","

1) Rotate out of crucifers for 3 years.

2) Avoid planting adjacent to a field infected the previous season.

3) Control susceptible weeds and volunteer  plants.

4) Remove plant debris or bury by deep-plowing, important for preventing sexual recombinants from developing with new virulence or fungicide resistance. Flailing followed by a shallow incorporation may be sufficient depending on amount and size of plant debris as well as environmental conditions.

Turnip and Rutabaga ,(Brassica sp.)-Powdery Mildew,"The fungus, Erysiphe cruciferarum (syn. E. polygoni), can infect most crucifer crops and cruciferous weeds, but strains exist that have specificity and will infected only a subset of the crucifers. Older leaves are more susceptible to powdery mildew than younger leaves. Stressed plants will be more susceptible to disease. The fungus survives on infected hosts or as chasmothecia (formerly cleistothecia, sexually-produced survival structures) on infected crop debris. Disease is promoted under cool conditions of low rainfall and reduced relative humidity.


","A powdery, whitish-gray coloring consisting of the fungus and its spores develops on infected leaves. In advanced stages, leaves are distorted, twisted, and retarded in growth; mature rutabaga leaves may turn purple with severe infections. Leaves ultimately turn yellow and then die prematurely. On resistant rutabaga cultivars, a purplish coloration may develop around infections sites.


","

1) Plant resistant varieties if available.

2) Avoid over-application of nitrogen fertilizers; use an optimum, balance fertility regime.

3) Avoid drought stress.

4) Avoid continuous cropping of susceptible crucifers.

5) Crop rotation. If only powdery mildew is a concern, it is enough to rotate out of crucifers just one growing season so long as all volunteers and cruciferous weeds are controlled.

","Foliar fungicide applications can help when under severe disease pressure.

5) Sulfur formulations are registered for kale (Kumulus DF , Microthiol Disperss , Sulfur 6L, etc.). Sulfur is fungitoxic in its vapor phase and, therefore, is effective only when air temperatures promote volatilization. Sulfur volatilizes above 65°F but becomes phytotoxic above 95°F. Using it above 85°F is not recommended. Although sulfur reduces sporulation of established infections, it is primarily a protectant and must be applied before infection. Begin applying when weather conditions are appropriate and continue at weekly intervals. See label for details on rates and reentry intervals.

6) Frequent sulfur applications can negatively affect beneficial insects.

Turnip and Rutabaga ,(Brassica sp.)-Sclerotinia Stem Rot and Watery Soft Rot,"Sclerotinia sclerotiorum is a fungus that overwinters as small black structures (sclerotia) attached to decomposing infected plant residues or in the soil. Sclerotia can survive at least several years. After a moisture-conditioning period of at least 70 days, they produce a small, stalked, cup-shaped fruiting structure (apothecium), which releases ascospores into the air. These spores may infect senescent tissue such as dying leaves or petals dropping. These spores can also attack injured or diseased tissues such as leaves with leaf spots or stems with black leg. Plants in wheel tracks are highly susceptible to infection. Sclerotia also may germinate and directly attack plants. After colonizing a small portion of a plant part, the fungus can invade the rest of the plant and can grow from plant-to-plant within a field. Moist conditions within the plant canopy favor infection; rains, dews, or irrigation practices that keep foliage wet for long periods are associated with Sclerotinia outbreaks.
Other host plants include bean, cabbage, carrots, pea, lettuce, potato, green pepper, cucurbits, parsnip, radish, canola, flower seed crops, and sunflower. Dandelion (Taraxacum officinale) is a very susceptible weed host.


","The disease occurs mainly on aboveground parts, producing a cottony white mold. As turnip leaves, stems, or petioles decay, small white bodies appear in the mold and gradually change from white to black. Finally, the mold is replaced by numerous hardened sclerotia; which can form on the outside of plant tissues or inside of stems and storage roots.
On seed crops, stem attacks can cause severe losses. Diseased tissues eventually bleach white. Sclerotia, which are black on the surface and white inside, associated with this bleached tissue, are diagnostic.

Turnip and Rutabaga ,(Brassica sp.)-White Leaf Spot and Gray Stem,"The fungus, Pseudocercosporella capsellae (sexual stage: Mycosphaerella capsellae), has been observed in various Brassica    vegetable and seed crops in Oregon. It has been reported in oilseed rape in the United Kingdom and Canada with pod losses of 15% having been reported in Europe. Turnip, Chinese cabbage, mustards and oilseed rape are thought to be more susceptible than cabbage, cauliflower, broccoli and other vegetable Brassica species. Horseradish and radish are susceptible to white leaf spot as well as weedy types such as wild radish, wild mustard, and shepherd's purse. Turnip seed crops can experience fairly severe outbreaks of white leaf spot in western Oregon.
Ascospores develop on infected Brassica or Raphanus residues during the autumn and possibly winter or spring months; these ascospores are wind-dispersed relatively long distances following rain or dew events. After successfully infecting, asexual spores (conidia) subsequently develop in the leaf spots and are spread relatively short distances by rain or splashing water, causing secondary spread, including pod and seed infections. Seed transmission has not been reported to play a major role in disease outbreaks; infected crop residues are usually necessary for large scale outbreaks, but seed transmission can lead to introduction of disease into new areas. Temperatures of 50°F to 60°F with moist conditions (rain, dew, or irrigation) promote disease development.


","This fungus can attack leaves, stems and pods. Tan, irregular or roundish spots develop on leaves, especially leaf tips and edges, later becoming ashy-gray to white with a brownish margin and sometimes a yellowish halo. White conidia can be observed on the underside of leaf spots. Leaf spots will become dark brown as leaves senesce, due to the initiation of the sexual stage. The center of older lesions may fall out, resulting in a shot hole appearance. Lesions may coalesce when disease is severe, resulting in defoliation. Stem lesions are elongated and first brown, turning ashy-gray to white with a brownish margin and numerous tiny dark specks due to the formation of the sexual stage; there is a distinct boundary between diseased and healthy tissue on the stem. Gray stem lesions are superficial; the pith is not severely infected, helping to distinguish gray stem from black leg. Pod infections are at first small brown spots that expand and turn grayish-white with numerous tiny dark specks due to the formation of the sexual stage.

Several fungi occur worldwide including G. orontii, G. verbenae, E. verbinicola, Podosphaera verbenae and P. xanthii (common in Eastern North America).  It is not certain which type is found in the PNW. Only one plant sample sent into the OSU Plant Clinic in 50 years was diagnosed with powdery mildew. This fungus is favored by conditions that produce high humidity but dry leaves. It is a highly specialized pathogen that forms a close association with the host. Conditions that favor the host also favor the pathogen. Much of the fungus remains outside infected plant parts where it grows on the surface but sinks root-like structures called haustoria into plant cells to obtain nutrients. The white growth seen is composed of both mycelium and fungal spores.


","Colonies appear as the typical powdery, white patches on leaf surfaces. A purpling and chlorosis of the upper leaf surface is also associated with powdery mildew of verbena. This symptom could also be confused with nitrogen deficiency. Colonization is generally on the leaf underside. Lower leaves generally are the first to show symptoms and later become necrotic.

Bacteria also produce a protein that acts as an ice nucleus, increasing frost wounds that bacteria easily colonize and expand.


","Spots are at first water soaked, then turn brown and irregular in shape. Oregon observations are that spots may be angular. Margins frequently develop a bacterial exudate. Numerous spots during early shoot growth can deform leaves. Stem lesions are elongate and generally not as obvious. Severe infections can result in a shoot dieback.

Walnut ,(Juglans spp.)-Anthracnose,"A fungus, Ophiognomonia leptostyla. The disease has caused severe defoliation, especially in the 'Adams' cultivar. The fungus overwinters in old infected leaves and nuts on the ground and in cankers on twigs of the past year's growth. During spring rains, spores (ascospores) are forcibly ejected from fruiting bodies (perithecia), which develop in the old diseased leaves and nuts, and are blown to new growth where they induce primary infection. Spores produced in acervuli in old twig lesions are also a source of primary infection. Successive generations of summer spores borne in primary and secondary lesions subsequently spread the disease.


","On leaves, many circular to irregularly circular reddish-brown to grayish-brown spots 0.0625 to 0.75 inch in diameter. On stems of shoots of current-season growth, lesions are oval to irregularly circular, sunken, light grayish-brown dead areas with dark reddish-brown margins. Summer fruiting bodies (acervuli) of the fungus are generally borne in abundance on twig lesions. The disease is most serious and destructive on nuts; in the husk it causes depressed circular to irregularly circular dead spots, not quite as large as those on leaves. If the nut is infected very young, it does not develop normally and often drops to the ground prematurely. Severe disease may seriously reduce yield.

Walnut ,(Juglans spp.)-Black Walnut Toxicity,"A naturally occurring chemical, called juglone, found in black walnuts is toxic to certain plants. Highest concentrations are found in buds, nut hulls and roots. The chemical is not very soluble and accumulates under the canopy of trees. However, damage to pine was noted well beyond the dripline of walnut trees. It is also released by living roots in small amounts and by dead roots as they decay. Other nut trees (such as English walnut, pecan and butternut) produce smaller amounts of juglone.
Plants sensitive to juglone include alder, alfalfa, apple, asparagus, birch, blackberry, blueberry, cabbage, crabapple, eggplant, Kalmia, lilac, magnolia, peony, pepper, potato, pine, privet, rhododendron, rhubarb, silver maple, spruce, and tomato.
Resistant plants include arborvitae, beans, beets, catalpa, cedar, cherry, corn, daffodil, elm, ferns, forsythia, hawthorn, hemlock, iris, locust, most maples, oaks, onions, orchard grass, pachysandra, pear, rose, sycamore, viburnums and wheat.


","Plants grow poorly or not at all next to or underneath walnut trees.

Walnut ,(Juglans spp.)-Blackline,"A virus (walnut isolate of Cherry leafroll virus) was consistently isolated from affected English scions but not from black walnut or Paradox rootstocks in California. Because spread in California is not natural in young orchards until walnut trees flower, the virus is spread by pollen. Bark patch grafts from English walnut scions on black walnut (Juglans hindsii), or Paradox rootstocks, readily transmit the causal agent of blackline but only if the inoculum was applied to the English walnut scion. Indicator trees developed characteristic blackline at the union within 1 year. The virus is only in the English walnut scions of naturally infected trees. Blackline occurs at the union of English walnut on J. hindsii or Paradox rootstocks due to the hypersensitive reaction of the rootstocks.


","The disease is in Oregon only in the 'Franquette' variety when grafted on black walnut rootstocks. It has not been found in Persian walnuts or seedling Persian walnut stocks. Mature trees are affected. Symptoms include poor shoot growth, and leaves yellow early and drop from part or all of the tree. Often the tree dies 3 to 5 years after the first symptoms. At the graft line, a water-soaked brownish area constricts vascular tissues.

Walnut ,(Juglans spp.)-Blight,"Xanthomonas arboricola pv. juglandis (formerly Xanthomonas campestris pv. juglandis), a bacterium that overwinters in infected buds and catkins. Buds with the highest bacterial populations are the ones most likely to develop blight. During early spring growth, bacteria spread along developing shoots and nuts. There seems to be very little secondary spread to other shoots and trees by raindrip. This results in local infection centers within a tree or orchard. Frequent, prolonged rain, just before and during bloom and for about 2 weeks after, result in severe blight outbreaks within these local infection centers. This is when nuts are most susceptible. Buds for next year's shoots are colonized very soon after their formation in the spring. Although the 'Howe' cultivar is resistant to blight in Oregon, most commercial cultivars are susceptible. 'Ivanhoe' is extremely susceptible.


","On leaves, infection appears first as reddish-brown spots, on the stems as black, slightly depressed spots often girdling the shoots. Young, infected leaf and catkin buds turn dark brown or black and soon die. The disease is serious on nuts, where it causes black slimy spots of varying sizes. The organism penetrates the husk, the shell, and occasionally the edible meat. Late-season infection produces black rings on husks. Nuts may fall prematurely.


","Prune out diseased twigs and branches, if practical.

","Spray at early prebloom (when catkins begin to enlarge), late prebloom (when shoots begin to expand), and early postbloom. In California, initial treatments are recommended when the terminal buds break. Resistance to copper products (Group M1 fungicide) has been seen widely in California and may be a problem in the Pacific Northwest. However, copper resistant bacteria do not seem to cause as much disease as ones that are copper sensitive. Addition of mancozeb (Group M3 fungicide) will boost the copper-ion concentration and may result in improved disease control. Bacteria, however, will become resistant to the higher-copper concentrations. Most spray adjuvants have not improved blight control; however, silicone-based adjuvants show promise.

Walnut ,(Juglans spp.)-Crown Gall,"The bacteria Rhizobium radiobacter (formerly Agrobacterium tumefaciens) and R. rhizogenes (formerly A. rhizogenes). As galls in soil break down, bacteria are released and can be transported by moving soil or water. Pathogenic bacteria can also be spread by pruning equipment. In the absence of tree roots, bacterial populations gradually decrease, but the pathogen may survive in soil at least 2 years. Long-distance transport is through shipment of diseased plants.
Bacteria enter trees through wounds, either natural or caused by pruning, grafting, mechanical injury from cultivation, chewing insects, or the emergence of lateral roots. The bacteria overwinter in the roots and can repopulate above ground portions in the spring. This systemic population of bacteria can cause disease in many different parts of the tree. After the bacterium enters a wound, a small piece of its DNA is transferred into the tree's DNA. The ""foreign"" DNA transforms normal cells in the wounded area into tumor cells. Once transformed, tumor cells proliferate automatically. The result is a gall, a disorganized mass of hyperplastic and hypertophic tissue. If infection occurs below 60°F, galls may not form until the next two growing seasons.
The walnut rootstock Paradox is much more susceptible than black or English walnut especially under nursery conditions.


","Galls are often at or just below the soil surface on roots and at the transition zone between root and trunk sometimes referred to as the root crown. They may frequently be on roots but less frequently above ground on the trunk. Galls usually are rounded with a rough, irregular surface. They appear as small protuberances on the plant surface. Young, actively developing galls are light green or nearly white, and tissue is soft. As galls age, they become darker and woody. Outer portions can slough off with age. Sometimes galls have a rather smooth surface, which makes it difficult to distinguish between gall and callus growth, especially if the gall is at the plant base or at the graft or bud union. Galls may continue to grow and reach a diameter of 10 inches or more on older trees. Neither bacterial streaming nor ooze is associated with gall tissue. Severe galling of young trees weakens the trees, disrupting vascular flow, which results in stunting and death. Nut production is reduced when young trees are infected.


","

1) Use only pathogen-free nursery stock. Inspect new plants; do not plant any with galls.

2) Avoid planting in sites with a recent history of crown gall.

3) Avoid wounding plants, especially at planting. If root pruning at planting, soak in biocontrol agent listed below.

4) For a few trees with galls, use a hatchet and chisel to remove galled tissue, and then remove a ring of bark from around the galled area. A propane torch can  then be used to heat, dry and sterilize that area.

5) Remove and destroy badly affected plants.

6) Preplant soil solarization has been effective for cherry nursery stock in western Oregon. Place clear plastic (preferably anti-condensation film) directly on smooth, rototilled ground, which has been irrigated to field capacity and then allowed to drain for 1-2 days. Bury the edges of the plastic to trap the heat. Solarize for 4-6 weeks (or longer) during the hottest part of the summer, beginning in early- to mid-July. This technique may be helpful after diseased trees are removed from a site on which walnut trees are to be planted again.

7) Sanitize grafting and cutting equipment frequently in nursery production.

","


1) Gallex (ready to use) painted on very young galls to reduce further development. Galls may return the following year or, if treated late, may continue to develop. Tissue surrounding the gall may be injured, especially on younger plants. Prepare the surface by removing soil from around the galled area, and allow the area to dry before applying. . 24-hr reentry.

","Agrobacterium radiobacter K84 is preventive only. Latent infections (symptomless) and existing galls are not controlled. A suspension of Strain 84 may be used as a soak or spray.

Walnut ,(Juglans spp.)-Downy Leaf Spot,"The fungus Microstroma juglandis is widespread in western production areas. The disease is more common in wet years and in orchards with poor air circulation. Hyphae of the fungus emerge from stomata, especially along veins and produce white masses of spores.


","Lesions are soft to bright yellow on the upper surface and angular following leaf veins. The corresponding areas on the undersurface are chalky white where the fungus is sporulating. Lesions become necrotic with age and may coalesce causing the leaf to turn brown and dry. Infection of young leaves may be distorted. Rarely symptoms on fruit may be seen as small, circular downy area on the hull. The lesion grows as the fruit grows. The edge may be downy at first but then turns dark brown to black. The result is a wide dark circle with a lighter green center with a sunken margin.

All walnut rootstocks are susceptible but trees on Paradox hybrid are sometimes more vigorous than nearby trees on black walnut rootstock. Can cause serious replant problems so be sure to sample before replanting into an area that has had walnut.


","Trees show few distinctive symptoms aboveground. Infected trees may grow slowly with dieback and/or chlorosis, which may occur in the upper branches. Damaged trees may be grouped in patches in the field. Roots have brown to dark, elongate lesions, about 0.5 inch in diameter, in the inner root tissue.

Walnut ,(Juglans spp.)-Phytophthora Root Rot,"Many Phytophthora species, fungus-like microorganisms, cause a root and root crown rot of walnuts. The more important ones in California are P. cinnamomi and P. citricola. Cool, wet, or waterlogged soils favor the disease. Prolonged (24 hours or more) and repeated periods of saturation favor infections. Rootstocks vary in susceptibility to the different Phytophthora species, and none are resistant to all species. In general, Paradox rootstock is more tolerant of several Phytophthora species than is northern California black walnut. The disease kills young trees because their root systems and root crown areas are small compared to those of mature trees. This is a rare disease problem in Oregon where orchards are on well-drained hillsides.


","Chronic infections, usually of the roots, cause reduction in growth and early senescence and leaf fall. Terminal shoots may die and foliage may be sparse. These trees may be unthrifty for several years before succumbing to the disease. Root crown rot is characterized by decayed bark at the base of infected trees. A black exudate from the bark may be noticeable. When the bark is stripped away, the cambium is brown with a water-soaked, zonate appearance between white, healthy tissue and brown, diseased tissue. Once crown rot girdles the tree it will collapse and die soon after the first warm weather of spring. Leaves of such trees wilt, dry, and remain attached to the tree. Except for the quick collapse in warm weather, the canopy symptoms are similar to those of blackline or Armillaria root rot.

2) Avoid excessive irrigation that saturates the soil or frequently wets the root crown of the tree.

Walnut ,(Juglans spp.)-Thousand Cankers Disease (Black Walnut Decline),"A fungal disease (Geosmithia morbida), vectored by the walnut twig beetle (Pityophthorus juglandis), that can cause death of black walnut (Juglans nigra). The disease has been detected in many Western States including eastern Washington, Idaho, and throughout Oregon on both sides of the Cascade Range (although insect trapping in the Grand Ronde Valley of OR did not detect the beetle). Several quarantines of plants, wood and wood products have been established in some of the states in the Eastern United States. It was first noticed in Oregon during the early 1990's. Most of the trees impacted at that time were on poorly drained soils in the mid-Willamette Valley area. The majority of the problem seemed to have occurred over a 3-year period. There were few complaints about this problem until 2001 when this dieback occurred on a wide variety of soil types, including productive agricultural soils, in the Portland metropolitan area. Beyond the Pacific Northwest it has now been confirmed in Indiana, Maryland, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, North Carolina, Virginia, and Italy.
The canker causing fungus Geosmithia morbida has been found in association with walnut twig beetles and their galleries. Fungal spores are carried and introduced into the tree by adult beetles during gallery construction. Subsequent canker development in the inner bark disrupts the flow of nutrients throughout the tree. Armillaria root rot has also been found along with declining trees. It has been hypothesized that the phloem-limited cankers starve the trees for nutrients and reserves thereby weakening them and encouraging other diseases and winter injury to ultimately kill the tree. Phytoplasma testing during the 08 growing season was negative and remains an unlikely cause of this problem.
The walnut twig beetle adults are very small and are reddish-brown in color. It is a typical-looking bark beetle with four to six concentric ridges on the upper surface of the pronotum. The larvae are white, C-shaped, and found in the phloem. Egg galleries created by the adults are horizontal (across the grain) and the larval galleries tend to be vertical (along the grain). There are most likely two main peaks of flight. One in May/June and another Sept/Oct. Flight often occurs when the temperature is 65°F or above. Adults respond to volatile extracts from girdled branches.
Small diameter black walnut (Juglans nigra) trees in Colorado died within one to two years after first symptoms were observed. Decline and death occurs much more slowly in the PNW on large diameter black walnut hybrids (J. nigra x J. hindsii). Young, small diameter trees found growing near declining trees have remained symptomless. Western black walnut species may host both insect and fungus, show minor symptoms or even appear to recover in succeeding years. Preliminary testing found J. nigra to be much more susceptible than J. hindsii or other Juglans species. This may account for the different disease progression in different areas. English walnuts (J. regia) are not as susceptible but the disease is easily found in English walnut orchards


","The dominant symptom is that branches fail to leaf out in the spring. Branches may leaf out very weakly in the spring or, less often, die anytime during the summer. Some trees will express sudden dead wood and/or progression of symptoms during the growing season. Generally dead leaves do not remain on the declining branches. Dieback always appears to start in the upper crown and progresses to lower branches in succeeding years. Some trees appear to have top dieback appearing almost concurrently with limb dieback at various places throughout the crown. Some trees may exhibit a thin canopy with few yellowing leaves. Trees may die within 2 to 5 years once symptoms are noticed but the majority, experience a slow dieback over many years. This problem has been observed mostly in mature trees of large diameter (DBH).
Carefully remove the bark from symptomatic limbs to find cankers. When peeling the bark, do not cut too deeply as beetle galleries and fungi are found in the living bark (cork cambium and not the wood cambium). Individual cankers may at first be only a few millimeters in diameter, but ultimately can be 3 cm or greater and have an elongate oval shape. Typically the appearance of a shallow tunnel produced by the walnut twig beetle will be present near the center of the canker. Many small, dark, dead areas (cankers) can be found under the bark of heavily infected trees. The cumulative effect of innumerable cankers produces limb girdling that cause dieback.
No witches' brooms have been observed on declining trees. Sometimes epicormic shoots will be seen but if present they are not abundant, except in The Dalles, Oregon where epicormic shoots are very numerous. Declining trees do not consistently have visible trunk cankers, heart rots, butt rots, storm damage, commercial pruning or herbicide use in common.


","None is known. Although the disease has similarities to Dutch elm disease, similar control tactics are not warranted. The disease is not expected to be root graft transmissible, which would require removal of adjacent trees. Quick removal of infected trees once identified is also not expected to be necessary.

1) A set of 2 trees in each of 2 locations (for a total of 4 trees) that were topped or pruned hard due to their location under power lines have remained healthy while nearby trees that were not pruned declined or died. This indicates that pruning hard (lower on the branch or trunk) may help trees that exhibit less extensive dieback. It is suggested to remove limbs below the margin found between necrotic and healthy cambium.

2) If trees continue to dieback the following year then tree owners might consider selling their trees for lumber to recoup pruning and tree removal costs.

3) Do not sell or transport firewood or logs with intact bark from infected trees to areas without the problem. Logs can remain a source of both beetle and fungus for at least 18 months.

","None is known. Research on insecticides and/or fungicides applied to the trunk, crown or soil or injected into the tree has not been done. Most experts agree that these applications would have minimal if any effect on disease progression. In Colorado, infested black walnut trees that have received repeated commercial insecticide treatments have continued to decline and die. Investigations on insect repellants (such as racemic limonene) are an active area of research.
It is not known if treatments to control powder post beetle on lumber will also control walnut twig beetle.
Injection of bactericides for the control of phytoplasma is not justified.

Watermelon ,(Citrullus sp.)-Bacterial Fruit Blotch/Seedling Blight,"Acidovorax avenae subsp. citrulli (syn. = Pseudomonas pseudoalcaligenes subsp. citrulli), a seedborne bacterium that affects watermelon, cantaloupe, and different types of melons. Damage in the greenhouse can be high. Field losses can be severe particularly in humid environments. Field tests indicate that fruit blotch is an unlikely threat in north-central Oregon where watermelons grow in a hot, dry environment using drip tape and plastic mulch.


","Greenhouse symptoms begin as small water-soaked lesions on the underside of the cotyledon followed by necrotic lesions. A single infected plant in a tray can infect many nearby plants resulting in a circular pattern of infection. Lesions can develop on the first true leaves before transplanting in the field.
Field symptoms can develop throughout the growing season. Lesions can be anywhere on the leaf but most often are near the midrib. Fruit symptoms begin as small greasy-looking water-soaked spots that often enlarge quickly; infected areas on the melon are a darker green than normal. Large areas of the melon can be involved. Infected areas on fruit become necrotic, either in distinct localized irregular spots or over wide areas. Cracks in the rind occur with time. Fruit blotch will not, until advanced, produce symptoms in the melon's flesh.

Weeping Fig ,(Ficus benjamina)-Leaf Drop,"Physiologic: any sudden change in environment or even a gradual change to below-optimum growing conditions. Cold drafts, cold water, dark location, time of year, or simply moving it to a different location in the house can cause leaves to drop. This plant needs plenty of indirect light and 60°F to 70°F temperatures.


","As days get short in late fall, green leaves often drop, leaving the tree almost bare. Green buds generally remain on branches, although some may dry up. It is natural for some green leaves to drop in spring as a new flush of growth begins.

Wheat ,(Triticum aestivum)-Bacterial Leaf Blight,"The bacterium, Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae, causes a disease favored by cool to mild temperatures (59°F to 77°F) and high relative humidity. The bacterium is in seeds, soil, plant residues, and water and may spread by infected seed or water. Severe epidemics are periodic in irrigated wheat. Other cereals may be affected, including oats, rye, and triticale.


","Generally after boot stage, water-soaked spots develop, which expand and progress from gray-green to tan-white. Spots may coalesce into irregular streaks or blotches, and entire leaves may turn brown and die while heads and glumes remain symptomless. Slimy droplets may develop on leaves in wet weather.


","Bacterial diseases are difficult to control once symptoms are evident in the field.

1) The best control is to avoid the disease by planting pathogen-free seed.

2) Irrigate less frequently to keep relative humidity lower.

3) Avoid overhead irrigation when possible.

Wheat ,(Triticum aestivum)-Barley Yellow Dwarf,"Barley yellow dwarf virus (BYDV) is present in many cultivated and wild grasses. Many grassy species in non-managed grasslands present in the Pacific Northwest are susceptible to BYDV, including: Achnatherum lettermanii, A. occidentale, A. thurberianum, Alopecurus pratensis, Bromus inermis, Danthonia intermedia, Elymus elymoides, Poa bulbosa, P. fendleriana, P. secunda, Sporobolus airoides, and S. cryptandrus. A group of virus strains can incite yellow dwarf and cause worldwide disease problems on barley, oats, and wheat. Some hosts may not show visible symptoms of infection, as in common for corn in the Pacific Northwest. BYDV is transmitted by several species of aphid, including the bird cherry-oat aphid (Rhopalosiphum padi), rose-grass aphid (Metopolophium dirhodum), English grain aphid (Sitobion avenae), corn leaf aphid (Rhopalosiphum maidis), and green bug aphid (Schizaphis graminum). Virus strains transmitted primarily by Rhopalosiphum padi are now called Cereal yellow dwarf virus (CYDV)-RPV, while those transmitted by Sitobion avenae are called BYDV-MAV. Virus strains transmitted by both aphid species are called BYDV-PAV. Metopolophium dirhodum is reported to transmit BYDV-PAV strains and possibly CYDVRPV, while Rhopalosiphum maidis is reported to transmit BYDV-MAV and an additional strain, BYDV-RMV. Studies in cereals have shown that when BYDV-PAV and CYDV-RPV occur to together in a cereal plant, more severe symptoms develop than when plants are infected with either virus strain alone. Research in cereals has shown that plants infected with strains of yellow dwarf may be more susceptible to root diseases, including Take-all. Barley yellow dwarf is more severe under cool, moist conditions that promote the aphid population. x


","Symptoms can be variable and may be confused with nutrient deficiencies or stress. Early symptoms of fall infection of wheat may first appear during spring as yellowish or reddish leaf tips. Affected leaves may have yellowish, uneven blotches on leaves, which can turn reddish or purplish. Tissues next to midribs retain their green color longer than the rest of the leaf. The youngest leaves may not have an unusual color. Affected leaves may have a premature die back in hot weather.
Damage may not be severe, depending on growth stage at infection, virulence of the viral strain, susceptibility of the cultivar, temperature, and light intensity. Severely affected plants may be stunted and may not head. Infected plants may ripen prematurely or be predisposed to fungal diseases, such as root rot.


","

1) Plant in late fall or early spring so the susceptible seedling stage is before or after peak flights of the insect vectors during warm summer months.

2) In affected plantings, reducing stress on plants by maintaining balanced fertility and adequate soil moisture can aid in minimizing losses.

","Apply granular systemic insecticides in-furrow at planting to reduce aphid numbers. (For materials, rates, and procedures, consult the PNW Insect Management Handbook.)


",
Wheat ,(Triticum aestivum)-Black Point (Kernel Smudge),"Numerous species of fungi, including Alternaria, Fusarium, and Helminthosporium spp. They infect kernels during seed maturation, especially green kernels, and are favored by high relative humidity or rainfall. Some fungi can be pathogenic on seedlings that develop from infested seed.


","Affected areas are light brown to black in coloration and kernels may be shriveled.


",,"Fungicide application to protect seed heads during maturation are usually not economical. Seed treatments can improve germination and seedling health if more pathogenic species incite black point (See seed treatments listed under Wheat-Seed Decay and Damping-off).


",
Wheat ,(Triticum aestivum)-Cephalosporium Stripe,"The soilborne fungus, Cephalosporium gramineum (sexual: Hymenula cerealis), overwinters in association with infected crop residue. Plants are infected through wounds in the root system caused by cultivation (including fertilizer application), frost heaving, freeze damage without heaving, or soil insects. Because frost heaving aggravates disease development, the disease is worse on wet, poorly drained soils. Recent WSU research indicates that seed transmission may occur at low levels. Repeated crops of susceptible cereals and grasses are associated with more severe disease.


","Stripes appear in leaves at any growth stage. Yellowish stripes extend down to the leaf sheath, becoming prominently yellow and brown on maturing leaves. Because this fungus attacks the vascular system, vascular bundles connecting with stripes in the leaf are brown in the leaf sheath, and the joints are darkened inside. Leaves gradually yellow. Diseased plants may be stunted. Infected plants may mature early but heads either are empty or are filled with shriveled kernels. Seedlings may show a mosaic-like yellowing in early spring; leaves die before stripes develop. Plants will be stunted and white-headed.


","

1) Use a 3-year rotation that includes only one susceptible crop or grassy weed. Winter wheat and barley are susceptible. Spring grains are acceptable rotation crops because they usually escape infection. Legumes and corn are nonhosts.

2) Limit the size of the wheat plant in winter by planting late and limiting preplant nitrogen.

3) Reduce inoculum in soil by controlling susceptible grass weeds such as , , and  species.

4) Plant tolerant winter wheat cultivars (no resistant ones are available).

5) Moderately Susceptible -'Coda', 'Eltan', 'Hill 81', 'Hiller', 'Hyak', 'Lambert', 'Lewjain', 'Madsen', 'Moro', 'Rely', 'Rod', 'Rohde', 'Sprague', 'Temple', and 'Weatherford'.Susceptible-'Gene', 'Malcolm', 'MacVicar', and 'Stephens'.

6) Variety mixtures can be helpful for sites with a  problem. Current research at OSU recommends Coda/Rohde or Madsen/Rod mixtures.

7) Removing infested straw reduces disease severity but is inconsistent with conserving soil and water. Burning or baling straw and inversion tillage with a moldboard plow are effective but not recommended.

Wheat ,(Triticum aestivum)-Common Bunt (Stinking Smut),"Two fungi, Tilletia tritici (syn. = T. caries) and T. laevis (syn. = T. foetida), which are carried on seed or in soil and also can infect rye, triticale, and many grasses. Only very young seedlings can be infected. Disease requires cool, moist soil conditions at planting. Infection is either from smut spores on seed (seedborne) or from spores in soil close to the seed (soilborne). Soilborne spores last decades in soil. The disease is a problem in all wheat-producing areas east of the Cascade Range.


","No positive symptoms are apparent until the crop heads. In infected heads, light brown smut balls filled with dark brown spore masses replace all or part of the kernels. Crushing a smut ball releases a distinctive foul odor. Bunted heads remain green longer, and plants may be slightly stunted, and glumes can be distorted.

Infections may be at any stage of plant growth. Plants stressed by drought or freezing are predisposed to the disease, which occurs throughout the Pacific Northwest. It is less common than Fusarium Root, Crown, and Foot Rot (Crown Rot, Foot Rot, Seedling Blight, Dryland Foot Rot) but often occurs with it.


","In late fall and early spring, brown spots or blotches appear on roots and the subcrown internode, crown, and lower leaf sheath. There are also chocolate-brown leaf spots especially on lower leaves. In humid or irrigated areas, the pathogen also may infect heads to cause black point on seed. Severe infections cause a dry crown rot that leads to premature ripening of heads (whiteheads). Symptoms are similar to those of Fusarium foot rot.


","

1) Plant in late fall or early spring when soil at seed depth is 55°F or lower.

2) In warmer soil, plant seed shallow and not in deep furrows or a dust mulch.

3) Rotate to crops other than wheat or barley 2 or more years.

",
Wheat ,(Triticum aestivum)-Ergot,"The fungus, Claviceps purpurea, attacks barley, oats, rye, triticale, and numerous wild grasses as well as wheat. The hard black sclerotia of the fungus germinate to produce stromata, which form ascospores carried by wind or insects to the flowering cereal. A conidial stage, called honeydew, forms on the infected head; insects can transmit the honeydew to uninfected flowers. Sclerotia formed on the heads drop to the ground or are mixed with seed for the next year. Infections frequently spread from wild grasses into cultivated cereals. Losses can be severe if livestock eat sclerotia in grain. Ergot is favored by wet, cool weather.


","The most conspicuous symptom is hard, pointed, black to deep-purple sclerotia that replace one or more kernels in the head. Sclerotia are several times longer than kernels and are easily seen on the head or mixed with grain. After flowering but before heading, a sticky conidial stage, or honeydew, can be seen on infected heads.


","

1) Rotate cereals with a nongrass crop to significantly reduce inoculum in 1 year.

2) Do not plant seed that contains sclerotia.

3) If seed containing sclerotia must be used, plant seed at least 2 inches deep.

4) Mow native grasses before they flower.

5) When ergot is prevalent in native grass on the field's margins, harvest the outside of the field separately.

6) Cleaning removes most sclerotia from harvest grain.

7) Destroy screenings by burning. Do not feed to livestock.

8) Use tillage practices that bury sclerotia at least 1.5 inches below the soil surface.

Wheat ,(Triticum aestivum)-Eyespot (Strawbreaker Foot Rot),"The fungi, Oculimacula yallundae (syn. Tapesia yallundae; anamorph Helgardia herpotrichoides; syn. Pseudocercosporella herpotrichoides) and O. acuformis (syn. T. acuformis; anamorph H. acuformis). These fungi survive on infected crop residue in soil and causes disease on barley, oats, rye, and grasses as well as wheat. Because cool temperatures, wetter soils, and high humidity favor the disease; planting date, winter temperatures, and disease levels in the previous wheat crop will affect the amount of disease in a field. Tilling winter wheat in spring, like harrowing for weed control or shank application of fertilizer, increases the amount of foot rot damage. Applying more nitrogen than recommended also increases disease incidence.


","A disease called sharp eyespot, caused by Rhizoctonia cerealis, is often confused with eyespot caused by O. yallundae and O. acuformis. Distinguishing between eyespot and sharp eyespot is important in making decisions about fungicide applications.
The diagnostic symptom of eyespot is elliptical (eye-shaped) spots on leaf sheaths. Lesions are white to light brown at first, then turn dark. Later, the stem's base is attacked, and gray fungus may grow in the center of the infected area, whose margins are indistinct. Stems shrivel at the base and plants may lodge. Diseased tillers may mature early, producing white heads. Otherwise, heads are small and fill poorly under moisture stress and high temperatures.
The symptoms of sharp eyespot are also elongated, eye-shaped lesions. However, sharp eyespot lesions are bordered by a dark brown edge that sharply delineates the infected area from surrounding tissue. Centers of sharp eyespot lesions often are covered with white fungal growth, and centers fall out, leaving a characteristic hole.


","

1) The soft white wheat varieties Coda, Foote, Gene, Hyak, Madsen, Temple, and Weatherford have moderate resistance to eyespot.

2) Late-fall seeding can substantially reduce disease severity.

3) Minimal tillage and no-till practices reduce disease incidence compared to conventional tillage (moldboard plow, disk, harrow).

4) Plant spring wheat or barley in areas with a severe history of this disease.

5) Rotating to legumes, or spring cereals for 3 or more years reduces the inoculum available to infect the next wheat crop.

Wheat ,(Triticum aestivum)-Fusarium Head Blight (Scab),"Several species of Fusarium can cause scab, including: F. graminearum, F. avenaceum, F. culmorum, and Microdochium nivale (formerly Fusarium nivale). These fungal species easily reside in soil and can grow there under a wide range of conditions. They operate as plant pathogens and can colonize plant residues and live as saprophytes (without a living host). They also can infect roots of numerous plant species without causing aboveground symptoms, which means their population can increase in a field and one may never notice. In small grains, these fungi also can cause seed decay, seedling blight, and leaf spots as well as root and foot rot. Spores produced on plant residue on the soil surface can ride on wind to the wheat head and subsequently invade parts of it. Rain, irrigation, or heavy dew promotes the high humidity necessary for spore germination and penetration. The longer the wheat plants stay wet during flowering and early seed development, the greater the chance of infection and spread in the plant. The most favorable conditions for infection are prolonged periods (36 to 72 hours) of high humidity. Generally, wheat is most susceptible at the flowering stage. Scab-infected grain can contain the mycotoxins known as vomitoxin and zearalenone. Vomitoxin (deoxynivalenol) may cause vomiting and feed refusal in swine. Zearalenone is an estrogenic mycotoxin and may cause infertility in domestic animals. Scab in grain does not mean it has mycotoxins; however, scabby grain should be analyzed for vomitoxin and zearalenone. Scab was severe in eastern and south-central Idaho and Washington in 1982 and 1984.


","Dark brown spots develop on glumes shortly after the developing head is infected. Entire spikelets become blighted, and infection may spread to other spikelets. In warm, humid weather, pink mold will be visible. A peach-color spore mass may be at the base of infected glumes. The fungus may spread throughout the spike and down into the culm, leading to head death, which causes premature bleaching. Only part of a head may be prematurely bleached. Infected florets that do not die produce poorly filled grain.


","Environmental conditions play a key role in scab development, but certain cultural practices reduce pathogen survival, lowering the risk of scab infection.

1) Rotate fields out of cereals, grass seed, or corn for at least one year. Avoid crop rotations in which wheat follows other susceptible plants. Especially avoid planting wheat after corn or sorghum.

2) If irrigating, manage water application to minimize high-humidity periods.

3) Tilling to bury infested crop residues helps decrease risk. In minimum or no-till practices, spread and distribute chaff and other residue to speed decomposition, reducing pathogen populations.

4) Increasing the combine's airflow removes many scabby kernels, which are shriveled and light.

","Seed treatments containing Dividend, Mertect, or Thiram reduce Fusarium contamination on seed used to plant a subsequent crop, but the treatment has no effect on head blight.


1) Prosaro at 6.5 to 8.2 fl oz/A at early flower (feekes growth stage 10.5). Do not apply within 30 days of harvest. 12-hr reentry.

Wheat ,(Triticum aestivum)-High Plains Disease,"The virus that causes this disease is also referred to as Wheat mosaic virus, Maize red stripe virus, High plains tenui virus or High plains virus. This virus is transmitted by the wheat curl mite (Aceria tosichella), the same vector that transmits Wheat streak mosaic virus and both viruses have been detected in symptomatic plants. Corn, barley, yellow and green foxtail, rye, and witch grass may be sources of the HPV.


","Infected leaves exhibit a mosaic pattern and chlorotic spots. Co-infection with Wheat streak mosaic virus results in plants that are mottled, chlorotic, severely stunted, and may die. Mottling and a yellow mosaic pattern in parallel, discontinuous streaks develop on leaves.

It is not currently known to be in Pacific Northwest soils. If it or the disease were detected in locally produced wheat, the industry could suffer serious economic damage because the fungus is strictly regulated in international and domestic seed and grain trades.


","Karnal bunt is at best difficult to detect and identify in the field. A microscope and biochemical tests are required to accurately identify the pathogen. The most conspicuous symptom is the presence of small numbers of harvested seeds containing tissue that is gray at first but later turns black. Discoloration often is limited to the embryo end only but may extend over the entire kernel.

","Infected leaves may have dark green, erect leaves with yellowish streaks. Black infected heads are evident as soon as they emerge from the boot. Spikelets are transformed into a sooty black spore mass, which soon disperses in the wind. By harvest, only the bare white central axis of the head remains. Infected seed is not visibly altered and is fully germinable.

Wheat ,"(Triticum aestivum)-Nematode, Cereal Cyst","The cereal cyst nematodes, Heterodera avenae and H. filipjevi, occur in at least seven Western States including Idaho, Washington, Oregon, and California. This nematode has a wide host range in the Gramineae including oats, wheat, barley, rye, triticale and ryegrass. Susceptible spring grains are barley, oats, wheat, rye, and triticale. Spring cultivars are more severely affected than fall cultivars because the nematode attacks in spring when plants are small. Only a small number of resistant spring wheat and spring barley cultivars have been identified. Wheat and barley cultivars differ in ability to tolerate invasion by these nematodes. Yields of intolerant cultivars decline as the number of nematodes in soil increase. Yields of tolerant cultivars remain relatively stable even when the population of cereal cyst nematodes is high. Several tolerant cultivars of spring wheat and spring barley have been identified.
Cyst nematodes are sedentary endoparasites. The infective second-stage juvenile is generally at low levels in soil except during egg hatch in spring. Males may be in soil in late summer. Cysts (the dead body of the female, which holds eggs and allows eggs and juveniles to survive between host crops) can be obtained from soil any time, but cyst extraction requires a special procedure. This nematode can only reproduce on roots of living susceptible hosts. The nematode only invades juvenile tissue at root tips, hence the greater susceptibility of spring-planted crops. The nematode has different pathotypes (races), each of which attack a different set of hosts. In Oregon, wheat varieties with the resistance gene Cre1 prevent reproduction of H. avenae but not H. filipjevi. Barley with the resistance genes Ha2 or Ha3 also prevents multiplication of H. avenae.


","Plants in small to large patches, or larger areas up to several acres or entire fields are stunted and chlorotic. Symptoms are expressed more fully when mineral nutrition is limiting or root growth is otherwise impeded. In the field, the symptoms of cereal cyst nematode injury were first mistaken for Barley yellow dwarf virus. Roots are locally thickened and highly branched. Before harvest, white females can be seen attached to roots, appearing as one to several small white beads near areas of excessive root branching. Later, females become brown to black cysts, which are difficult to see without magnification.


","

1) Crop rotation. Avoid planting susceptible cereal (wheat, barley, oat) or grass crops successively or in close rotation. Rotate cereal crops with broadleaf (nonsusceptible) crops, corn, or resistant cereal cultivars.

2) Identify the species of cereal cyst nematode because wheat cultivars differ in their response to attack by  and .

3) Fall-planted crops can tolerate damage by this nematode more than spring-planted crops. Within the spring cereal cultivars, overall the 6-row feed and malting barleys have been collectively more resistant than the 2-row feed barleys, 2-row malting barleys, soft white wheats as well as the hard red and hard white wheats. In contrast, the 2-row feed and malting barleys were collectively more tolerant than entries in the other spring cereals classes.

4) No spring wheat cultivars are both fully tolerant and fully resistant to . Cultivars that are resistant and moderately tolerant include Dayn and WB Rockland. Cultivars with a balance of partial resistance plus partial tolerance include Kelse and Klasic. Tolerant but susceptible spring wheat cultivars include Alpowa, Buck Pronto, Cabernet, Glee, JD, Jedd, Jefferson, Louise, UI Petit, and UI Stone. While the cultivar WB Rockland is resistant and moderately tolerant to , it is not resistant to . In contrast, the cultivar SY Steelhead is resistant to and is tolerant but not resistant to .

5) Lenetah spring barley is both resistant and tolerant to . Cultivars that have acceptable levels of both resistance and tolerance include Julie, Baronesse, Champion, Xena, Idagold II, Transit, Millenium, and Quest. Cultivars that are very tolerant but quite susceptible in allowing nematode reproduction include Tetonia, Vespa, Copeland, Merit, Merit 57, Pinnacle, and Herald. Cultivars that are partially resistant but lack acceptable levels of tolerance include Goldeneye, Legacy, Steptoe, Tradition, Celebration, Odyssey, and CDC Fibar.

6) Assure adequate fertility for vigorous growth of the crop.

7) Avoid movement of soil from infested fields.

8) Identify the species of cereal cyst nematode because crop varieties may differ in their response to attack by  and .

Wheat ,"(Triticum aestivum)-Nematode, Root-knot","The root-knot nematode, Meloidogyne naasi, lives on roots of barley, wheat, other cereals, and grasses, primarily in heavy soils. Populations of infective juveniles are large only in spring. Spring-planted cultivars are more damaged than winter cultivars because the latter are larger when attacked. The disease is a problem in western Oregon. The Columbia root-knot nematode (M. chitwoodi) does not produce yield-depressing symptoms in wheat but will produce small root galls.


","In early spring, stunted and yellowish plants appear in zones of the field. Foliar symptoms tend to disappear with favorable growing conditions. Small knots and galls are on affected roots. Frequently it is difficult to distinguish between damage caused by excessive water and by root-knot.


","

1) Rotate barley or wheat with nonhosts (oats, sugar beets) in infested fields.

2) Winter plantings are affected less than spring plantings.

3) Reduce plant stress from soil compaction and low pH; improve plant growth.

",
Wheat ,"(Triticum aestivum)-Nematode, Root-lesion","Several species of lesion nematodes. The most important species found on wheat in the Pacific Northwest are Pratylenchus neglectus and P. thornei. These nematodes have broad host ranges, including spring- and fall-planted cereal crops, many grasses, and numerous broadleaf crops and weeds. High nematode populations can occur even in the very driest of wheat- and barley-producing regions and cause serious damage. Pratylenchus penetrans is common in irrigated, sandy soils but is not known to cause severe damage to small grain cereals.  Wheat and barley varieties differ in ability to tolerate invasion by these nematodes. Yields of intolerant varieties decline as the number of nematodes in soil increase. Yields of tolerant varieties remain relatively stable even when populations of root-lesion nematodes are high. Altho	ugh some wheat varieties are tolerant all current commercial varieties allow rapid multiplication of these nematodes and therefore may increase the level of risk for a subsequent planting of an intolerant wheat variety or other crop. Barley generally exhibits the highest level of tolerance and also suppresses multiplication and the population of lesion nematodes in soil.
Root-lesion nematodes are migratory endoparasites. Pratylenchus neglectus and P. thornei reproduce without mating (parthenogenesis) and males are rare or absent. Reproduction by P. penetrans requires mating and males and females occur in near-equal numbers. Numerous eggs are laid in roots as well as in soil and may hatch within 4 weeks. All life stages can invade roots but can also migrate back out into the soil. Most lesion nematodes are found in roots late in the growing season and in soil and remnants of old roots following plant maturation.


","Roots are thinner and less branched than normal. Lower leaves may become prematurely chlorotic, tiller numbers and tiller height may be reduced, and plants may appear unthrifty. An appearance similar to premature drought or inadequate supply of nitrogen or sulfur results from nematode damage that reduces uptake of water and nutrients.


","

1) Susceptible crops may increase the level of damage if produced before wheat or other intolerant crops. This has been documented for some cultivars of canola, mustard and chickpea, and for most cultivars of wheat.

2) Resistant crops suppress multiplication and may improve yields of subsequent plantings of sensitive wheat or other crops. See Table 'Plant resistance to root lesion nematodes,  and , in the Pacific Northwest.'

3) Winter wheat varieties with highest levels of tolerance to  include Tubbs, Goetze, Brundage 96, Idaho 587, Masami, Bauermeister, Weatherford, Chukar, Westbred 528, MDM, ORCF-102, and Lambert.

6) Spring wheat varieties with highest levels of tolerance to  include Buck Pronto, Tara 2002, Jerome, Jefferson, Wawawai, Zak, Otis, Macon, and Vida.

7) The most tolerant barley varieties include fall-planted Kold and spring-planted Camas and Bob.

1) No chemicals are registered for controlling these nematodes on wheat or barley.

2) Fumigation is too expensive for use on cereal crops, particularly in dryland environments where damage causes the greatest economic loss. Fumigation is also ineffective for controlling deep-lying populations.

Wheat ,(Triticum aestivum)-Physiologic Leaf Spot,"Often the cause is unknown, but it may be a deficiency or imbalance in mineral nutrition (especially minor elements such as chloride, manganese, or zinc), an inherited genetic dysfunction in wheat, or a combination of these and other abiotic and biotic agents. In low rainfall regions of the Pacific Northwest, the disease is usually associated with a deficiency in chloride nutrition. Fungicides and stubble burning are not effective controls, and little is known about the effects of tillage and crop rotations.


","Symptoms first appear in March. Spots' characteristics may differ depending on the lesion's age, wheat variety, weather, and other factors. Typically, the first symptom is a tiny brown spot or fleck on lower leaves. A yellowish halo may or may not surround the spot. Spots enlarge into brown, necrotic areas, oval or irregularly shaped, with or without yellowish halos. Sometimes the symptom is simply a yellowish, rather than brown, spot of variable size and shape. The disease often becomes more severe on lower leaves as it establishes on younger leaves. If severe, older leaves die prematurely, and up to 60% of the flag leaf may turn brown and die. Yield can be reduced 20% or more. Symptoms easily are confused with those of Septoria blotch, tan spot, bacterial leaf blight, and certain minor-element deficiencies.


","

1) Application of a chloride-containing fertilizer reduces the occurrence and severity of this disease in many areas. Chloride may be applied to soil before planting or sprayed onto foliage during seedling growth, before leaf spot symptoms become evident.

2) Plant the least susceptible varieties. The varieties Dusty, Tres, Hyak, Hill 81, Moro, and Buchanan are moderately resistant. The varieties Lewjain, Yamhill, Cashup, Andrews, Oveson, Wanser, Basin, Daws, and Eltan are moderately susceptible. The varieties Malcolm, Kmor, Batum, Madsen, and Stephens are very susceptible.

",,
Wheat ,(Triticum aestivum)-Powdery Mildew,"The fungus, Blumeria graminis (syn. = Erysiphe graminis). Powdery mildew survives as either chasmothecia or as mycelium. Asexual (conidia) or sexual spores (ascospores formed in the chasmothecia) produced in the spring cause new infections on susceptible hosts. As colonies develop, more conidia are produced and disseminate. The powdery mildew colonies may eventually become spotted with tiny black dots, which are the chasmothecia. High humidity, temperatures ranging from 59°F to 72°F, and succulent growth favor mildew development. When the flag leaf becomes severely diseased by heading, yield losses can reach 50%.


","Powdery white, gray, or buff-color spore masses develop on leaves, stems, and heads. Distinct dark brown dots may be visible on older lesions. Heavily infected leaves soon yellow, brown, and die.


","

1) Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization; maintain a balance between potassium and phosphorus proportions.

2) Lighter seeding rates reduce stand density, improve air circulation, and reduce the amount of damage.

3) Soft red winter wheats are generally resistant.

4) Destroying host debris and volunteer wheat can reduce inoculum.

5) Rotation with resistant hosts can reduce inoculum.

6) 'Foote' has resistance to powdery mildew.

","Once disease is common on flag leaves before heading, fungicide applications are probably not economical. In areas where powdery mildew has been a problem, scout fields for powdery mildew early in the season and treat fields early if a build-up of disease is apparent before flowering.
Seed treatments reduce seedling infections.


Foliar applications may be used under severe disease pressure or when raising a highly susceptible variety.

Wheat ,(Triticum aestivum)-Septoria tritici Blotch,"The fungus, Zymoseptoria tritici (syn. Mycosphaerella graminincola, anamorph Septoria tritici), infects wheat leaves. This fungus survives on infected wheat plants or wheat stubble. The fungus produces ascospores on infected residues, which are spread by wind and infect new plants starting in the fall. Asexual spores (conidia) are produced by pycnidia in leaf spots as temperatures warm, and conidia are moved by splashing water. Time from new infection until conidia occur is shortest (11 days) when temperature is 59°F to 77°F. This disease has been a problem west of the Cascade Range, where frequent spring rains have been associated with severe  disease development. Septoria tritici blotch commonly co-occurs with Stagonospora nodorum blotch (formerly known as Septoria nodorum; leaf and glume blotch) in the same field or on the same plant. In the Willamette Valley, Septoria tritici blotch has been more common than Stagonospora nodorum blotch.


","Tan blotches with yellow margins appear first on lower leaves, especially those touching the soil. Tiny, black dots develop in the oblong leaf spots; these are the fruiting bodies known as pycnidia. Spots that develop on leaves higher up turn into reddish-brown, somewhat rectangular blotches that tend to follow the leaf veins. The entire leaf blade may be killed, and disease may spread to the leaf sheath.

Wheat ,(Triticum aestivum)-Snow Molds and Snow Rots,"Fungi cause four different snow mold diseases including Typhula ishikariensis and T. incarnata, which cause speckled snow mold; Microdochium (Fusarium) nivale, which causes pink snow mold; Myriosclerotinia borealis, which causes Sclerotinia snow mold, also known as snow scald; and Globisporangium iwayami (syn. Pythium iwayami) and G. okanoganense (syn. P. okanoganense), which cause snow rot. These diseases have been found on winter wheat in the Pacific Northwest, and are important when snow cover on lightly frozen/unfrozen ground persists for approximately 100 days. However, pink snow mold is the most widespread and does not require snow cover but is promoted by cool, wet weather. Speckled snow mold is restricted to areas where snow persists. These diseases affect winter wheat, rye, and barley as well as numerous grasses. The pathogens can survive on many plant species and persist in soil or with host debris.","A white, felty (or sometimes slimy) fungal mat on plants is evident as the snow disappears. Signs of the disease disappear as temperatures rise and sunlight increases. Damage is highly variable, ranging from a few dead leaves to the entire plant. If crowns are not damaged, plants may recover.


","

1) Grow spring wheat.

2) Rotating to legumes can reduce the incidence in a subsequent wheat crop.

3) Early seeding (early to late August) enables the development of larger, more tolerant plants.

4) Apply charcoal as coal dust to snow cover to speed snow melt.

5) The variety Eltan, has some resistance. 'Sprague', 'Edwin', and 'Bruehl' have very good snow mold resistance.

Wheat ,(Triticum aestivum)-Stagonospora nodorum Blotch,"The fungus, Phaeosphaeria nodorum (anamorph Stagonospora nodorum, formerly known as Septoria nodorum) , infects both leaves and glumes. This fungus survives between crops on infected wheat, barley, or oat stubble, and on leaves of volunteer wheat as well as grassy weed hosts. But the strains from other grassy host other than wheat are only weakly virulent on wheat (and vice versa). Stagonospora nodorum may be seedborne.
The fungus spreads under windy, wet conditions. Wet or humid conditions when temperature is 68°F to 81°F promote disease and symptom development. The diseases have been a problem only west of the Cascade Range, where frequent spring rains have been associated with severe disease development. Stagonospora nodorum blotch commonly co-occurs with Septoria tritici blotch in the same field or on the same plant. In the Willamette Valley, Septoria tritici blotch has been more common than Stagonospora nodorum blotch.


","Light-yellow spots appears first on lower leaves. Spots spread rapidly, forming yellowish, lens-shaped areas that turn into reddish-brown, irregular, roundish blotches that tend have yellow margins. As spore production begins, the reddish-brown tissues turn grayish and tiny, dark dots develop; these are the fruiting bodies known as pycnidia, which contain spores. Glume infections appears first as brown areas on tips of glumes. Purple-brown to grayish-brown blotches or streaks develop and progress downward, and tiny, black dots form as pycnidia develop. Seed from infected heads is shrunken and wrinkled.


","

1) Variety 'Foote' currently has good resistance. The varieties, Hill 81, Madsen, Yamhill, and Goetze, are moderately resistant to and commonly show about half the level of disease as the susceptible cultivars Gene, Malcolm, and Stephens.

2) Late planting may help avoid infection from fall inoculum.

","Seed treatment with Vitavax plus Thiram or Dividend only partly controls the seedborne phase of the disease.
Spray a fungicide at early flag-leaf emergence (Feekes stage 8 to 8.3) unless otherwise noted. Recommended for areas west of the Cascade Range, when spring rains are frequent, and for the cultivars Gene, Stephens, or Malcolm. Chemical control gave an economic yield advantage in some years when cultivars Yamhill, Madsen, or Hill 81 were grown. There was no economic advantage from applying a second fungicide.

Wheat ,(Triticum aestivum)-Stripe Rust (Yellow Rust),"A fungus, Puccinia striiformis (syn. P. glumarum), which may oversummer on volunteer or early fall-seeded wheat and certain wild grasses (Aegilops, Agropyron, Elymus, and wild Hordeum spp.), and sometimes cultivated barley. The fungus overwinters as mycelium in leaf tissues, surviving down to at least 23°F, but spores can blow in from distant infections. Cool summers, mild winters, and long, cool, wet springs favor the fungus. Historically, 50°F to 64°F temperatures with intermittent rains or dews was optimal for disease development but new races of stripe rust appear to be adapted to warmer temperatures and are aggressively attacking hard red wheats in the Midwestern United States and overcoming high-temperature adult-plant resistance in winter wheats throughout the Pacific Northwest.


","Citron-yellow uredinia (spore masses) appear in long stripes on leaves and, rarely, on stems and heads. As the crop matures, black spores (telia) are produced in stripes, which are covered by the leaf epidermis.


","

1) Most commercial winter wheat varieties had good to excellent resistance until 2004, when a new race appeared. Current ratings are available in extension and crop improvement association variety selection literature.

","
Seed treatments reduce seedling infections.


Foliar applications can be made if disease is present and conditions are expected to remain favorable. Field scouting aids in detecting stripe rust early in the epidemic, while the disease still can be managed through fungicide applications. Once the crop is in the grain-filling stage, fungicide benefits are unlikely.

Wheat ,(Triticum aestivum)-Take-all,"A fungus, Gaeumannomyces graminis (syn. Gaeumannomyces graminis var. tritici), which lives in soil or diseased cereal and grass stubble and straw. Damage is severe in western Oregon and Washington and in irrigated areas of central and eastern Oregon. It also can be serious in extreme northern Idaho and throughout the irrigated Snake River Plains. The disease is mild in most non-irrigated fields in low rainfall areas but causes economic damage in annual cereal produc tion or in years of above-average rain on fields with high-residue tillage practices. Lack of rotation will increase pathogen populations; vegetables, corn, annual legumes, and oilseed crops are non-hosts while wheatgrass and quackgrass (Agropyron spp.), bromegrass (Bromus spp.), and bentgrass (Agrostis spp.) are hosts. Infections are favored by soil at 50°F to 68°F and moist conditions, which are common in the Willamette Valley. In western Oregon, the severity of infection by flowering (during late May), soil moisture levels after flowering (June, July), and fertility program all strongly influence yield losses. Liming of moderately acidic soils increases disease incidence.


","The stem's base is covered with a coal-black fungal growth under leaf sheaths. Individual roots turn coal black and are coal black on the interior when scraped. Plants are stunted, mature early, and have white, empty heads. Some tillers may fail to head.


","

1) Crop rotation with at least one year out of wheat or barley is very effective at reducing the pathogen population.

2) Do not plant wheat after crops that were heavily infested with weedy grasses.

3) Bury grassy debris to ensure breakdown of infected plant residues.

4) Maintain good nitrogen levels. Using ammonia forms of nitrogen and chloride fertilizers lessen yield losses when soil pH is near 5.5. When soil pH is 5.2 or less, liming can aid, especially when low phosphorus (P) levels prevail.

","


1) Seed treatment with Dividend or Baytan is only partially effective.

Wheat ,(Triticum aestivum)-Wheat Soilborne Mosaic,"A virus, Wheat soilborne mosaic virus, transmitted by a soilborne fungus-like organism, Polymyxa graminis. In 1993, the disease was first found west of the Rocky Mountains, in Washington and in Columbia County, OR. The disease tends to be in wetter areas of the field, following the distribution of its fungal vector.


","A pale green to bright yellow mosaic on wheat leaves. Infected wheat does not show mosaic symptoms until spring. Effects on yield in Oregon are unknown, but stunted plants and partly filled kernels are evident on infected plants. Resting spores of P. graminis are evident on roots but also may be on plants not infected with the virus. Because the fungus tends to be in wetter areas, the disease may be misdiagnosed as nitrogen leaching.


","

1) Do not move soil by any means from infected sites, if possible.

2) In the Eastern and Central United States, resistant cultivars offer practical control. Resistance levels in Pacific Northwest cultivars are not known.

3) Late planting and long rotations out of cereals are helpful but usually not good enough for commercial control.

",,
Wheat ,(Triticum aestivum)-Wheat Streak Mosaic,"Wheat streak mosaic virus, a potyvirus vectored by an eriophyid mite, Aceria tulipae. The virus attacks and overwinters in wheat, oat, barley, and rye, and a large number of wild grass genera including Bromus (cheatgrass), Hordeum, Lolium, Agropyron, and Poa. The disease usually is in late-harvested or irrigated areas where wheat seedlings emerge before the current year's crop has been completely harvested. The disease spreads when mites move from the harvested field into the young cereal. Nitrogen applications can affect the incidence of both the virus and mites.


","Symptoms usually first appear on the field's edge or where seeded waterways pass through the field. Mottled stripes run up and down the leaves. Leaf edges all cup up and roll to the center of the leaf. If the lower leaf is examined carefully, the eriophyid mite vector frequently can be observed.


","

1) The most effective control is to have a host-free period between each cereal crop.

2) Destroying volunteer wheat and seeding late help reduce the disease.

Several species have been reported from all states including M. abieti-capraearum (with true fir, Abies spp., as the alternate host); M. epitea f. sp. tsugae (with hemlock as the alternate host); M. paradoxa (with larch as the alternate host); and M. ribesii-purpureae (with currant and gooseberry as the alternate hosts). The urediniospores can reinfect willow any time conditions are favorable. It can take two weeks to go from urediospore infection to formation of new urediniospores. Telia are produced in late summer and fall. In the spring teliospores produce basidiospores that infect the alternate hosts. Spores produced on the alternate hosts will also infect willow but not the alternate hosts.


","These species cause indistinguishable yellowish leaf spots on willow. The rusty spots (uredinia) appear on leaves, later turning brown or black (telia). Seriously infected leaves fall to the ground. The disease is more noticeable in August and September.
Symptoms on alternate hosts vary. True fir and hemlock develop orange-yellow, elongate aecia on current-year needles. Larch needles generally are lightly infected but are prematurely cast. Yellow leaf spots occur on currants and gooseberries.


","

1) Collect and destroy infected leaves when they fall.

2) If possible, remove the alternate host from the vicinity.

Willow ,(Salix spp.)-Wood Decay,"Two types of wood decay occur in living trees: white rots and brown rots. White rots appear to be more common in willow and are caused by Daedalea confragosa (soft white rot), Phellinus igniarus (white trunk rot) and Polyporus squamosus (white mottled rot). White rots cause all major structural components of the cell wall-cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin-to degrade. The strength of white rotted wood decreases only in advanced stages of decay. Infection occurs through branch stubs and wounds. Conks usually develop in these same areas.
Injuries from pruning cuts, sunburn, or storm damage can expose susceptible wood. Large wounds and stubs and horizontal cuts are often entry sites for decay fungi. Wood decay generally is observed in older trees after extensive fungal colonization. Decay fungi frequently function as secondary invaders following a succession of microorganisms, including bacteria, yeasts, and other fungi. Decay in a single tree may be caused by more than one fungal species.


","White rots cause moist, soft, or spongy wood that is a lighter color than sound wood. Fine black lines may run throughout the decayed area.
For Daedalea confragosa, the decay is indistinctly mottled, and faint, brown-zone lines may be present. The annual conks are leathery, shelf-like, and up to 6 inches wide. The upper surface is gray to brown, smooth, and concentrically zoned. The under surface has irregularly elongate, coarse pores, which sometimes almost appear gill-like.
The conks of Phellinus igniarus are also hard, woody, and usually hoof shaped. The upper surface of young conks is grayish-black and smooth, but with age this surface becomes rough and cracked.
For Polyporus squamosus, a white mottled rot of the heartwood is produced. The sapwood may also be invaded. The annual fruiting bodies are large, measuring up to 20 inches in width, and have a short, thick, lateral stalk, which is black at the base. The upper surface is whitish yellow and covered with darker scales. The pores in the lower surface are large (three to six per inch) and angular.
Each of these wood decays leads to limb breakage and/or uprooted trees during wind or ice storms. Many trees have decreased vigor and dieback.


","

1) Avoid wounding trees to prevent decay. For example, mowing equipment should not injure the roots, crown, or lower trunk.

2) Make pruning cuts adjacent to, but not into, the supporting branch, and prune when branches are small to enhance callus formation and wound healing.

3) Irrigation water, especially from sprinklers, should not wet the trunks.

4) Inspect trees for decay and/or conks to assess tree stability.

5) Remove affected trees to avoid damage to surrounding property or spread to other trees.

Zinnia,Alternaria Blight,"The fungus Alternaria zinniae has been reported on zinnia from Oregon and found many times on samples sent to the OSU Plant Clinic. The fungus overwinters in plant debris in soil or through contaminated seed. The fungus may persist in seeds for up to 7 years but for only 2 years in plant debris. Generally, weather or irrigation that keeps leaves wet for extended periods favors the disease, as does low nitrogen fertility. Free moisture is required for infection.
All Zinnia elegans selections are moderately to highly susceptible while Z. angustifolia is highly resistant.


","Small , circular, reddish-brown spots with grayish-white centers increase to irregular, large, brown dry areas. Leaves become brown and desiccated. Similar spots are on stems and may girdle the stem with dieback of the portions distal to that lesion. Dark brown-to-black cankers with sunken centers may also appear near the soil line. On flowers, small brown spots can enlarge to include the whole petal. Sporulation may be profuse and petals darken and wither. Damping-off of seedlings can also occur. May be confused with bacterial leaf spot, which has very similar symptoms.

Zinnia,Bacterial Leaf Spot,"Xanthomonas campestris pv. zinniae, a bacteria that can survive in dried zinnia leaves for as long as a year. They can reside on foliage for several months before initiating disease. The bacteria can also be seedborne contaminating the surface of the seed. Infected plant material is probably the most important source of contamination. Bacteria can be spread from plant to plant by splashing water from overhead or sprinkler irrigation. The disease spreads rapidly during warm, humid and rainy weather. Hot water soaks or antibiotics meant to clean the seed also reduced germination or were phytotoxic. There may be other experimental hosts but they have not been naturally infected.
Most common zinnia cultivars and Z. haageana are susceptible. The Crystal and Star series are highly resistant while the Profusion series are moderately resistant.


","Spots begin on lower leaves as dull gray water-soaked areas on the leaf. Numerous yellow or tan spots can develop across the leaf forming irregular dead areas. Often there is a yellow halo around individual lesions. Spots turn brown and angular which could then be confused with Alternaria leaf spot. Small brown spots may form on the ray flowers and if severe flower heads can be disfigured and completely decay.


","Practice strict sanitation and rigorous scouting to identify and remove infected plants in the early stages before the pathogen spreads.

1) Start with pathogen-free seed. Seed can be treated with a dilute bleach solution (10%) for 15 to 30 minutes. Be sure to test a small batch of seed for sensitivity to these treatments.

2) Plant resistant cultivars or species.

3) Plants with leaf spots should be discarded. Diseased plant debris should be removed from the growing area.

4) Workers should wash their hands after handling diseased plants or soil.

5) Handling of wet foliage should be avoided.

6) Minimize splashing when watering.

7) Increase spacing between plants.

8) Rotate plantings to different beds each year and choose open sunny sites.

Zinnia,Stem Rot,"Sclerotinia sclerotiorum, a fungus that produces hard, black sclerotia, which can survive many years in soil. The disease develops in cool, wet conditions and is more prevalent when plants form a complete, compact canopy that holds high relative humidity. The fungus can colonize dead organic plant matter and survive many years. 'Profusion White' zinnia is very susceptible. In the potato system, flowers are very susceptible to infection and are the main source of stem infection. Infected petals fall onto stems allowing the fungus to gain entry into the stems. Direct penetration of stems, in contact with the soil, from germinating soilborne sclerotia also occurs.


","Off-color lesions develop near the plant's base. Later a white, cottony fungal growth occurs on the stem. Hard, black sclerotia may develop with the white growth both outside and inside the stem. The upper part of the plant wilts and eventually dies. Damping-off of seedlings frequently occurs.


","

1) Use sterile, well-drained soil media.

2) Space plants for good air circulation.

3) Remove and destroy infected plants.

4) Rotate with less susceptible crops such as alyssum, daffodil, salvia, pansy, or ornamental grasses for at least 3 years. Resistant crops include rushes, sedges, and the fountain grass .
